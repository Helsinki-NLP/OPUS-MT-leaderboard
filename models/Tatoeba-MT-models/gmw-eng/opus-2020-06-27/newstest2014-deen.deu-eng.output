Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres apart: on Tuesday the new B 33 foot ramp at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - in sight of the older town hall.
Two plants so close together: intention or signposting?
This question was answered clearly yesterday by Gutach's mayor.
"The town hall camp was installed at the time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights securely both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially commissioned yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
We have the museum, two churches, the spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"In the case of the high traffic and pedestrians, another traffic traffic traffic traffic lights had to be established," says Eckert.
This also confirms Peter Arnold from Offenburg Landratsamt.
"Laughing current measurements on the B 33 daily about 12,000 vehicles pass the municipality of Gutach, of which about 10 percent are heavy load traffic," says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic lights is more than necessary: "Security is just going ahead," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic views had been carried out, including a circular traffic was considered, but because of the narrowness in the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area again rejected.
According to Arnold, everything was tested earlier in the location selection of the traffic lights: "By means of an extra transporter loaded with particularly long wooden poles, we have determined whether these vehicles can exit from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without turning the traffic lights."
The approximately 15 000 Euro expensive traffic lights system itself is the "modernest thing that is currently on the market," Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs, which shine so strongly that the lights of the motorists can be well recognized, for example, even with deep sun.
And it is also economical: the older light systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three light systems per driving direction.
Arnold explained the technique of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
Press the traffic button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the road is free, immediately green comes for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor examines whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be completed.
"If a group or disabled people go across the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will be safe over the road," Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver had to think about this as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly did the traffic lights show green for pedestrians, a high-class vehicle ran through - with bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth of the soul for more than 30 years.
The calamities of his Catholic village childhood - the languagelessness, the slope to brutal violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - have often described Carinthian poet.
The Büchner award winner is especially known as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosa texts Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance "Wetterlights on the top of the tongue", which can now be seen in Garage X at Petersplatz, therefore a collage of prosa texts.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibigene" (1987) with proseminiaturen from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauberend" (2003).
On the largely empty-spaced stage - important requisit: a clumsy sofa, on which it is clearly copied and masturbated - the eight-member ensemble is hanging through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance surpasses the template with a wealth of directing attacks, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic game forms.
Especially the actresses come up with the sometimes somewhat questionable Scenic implementations.
They are hard hit, dipped with their head under water, stacked with their evening robes on the wall.
Impelled in cellophan or bodice, they stooped onto dangerously high stubbles through the production, either monologizing them loud or lying completely stumped on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this strenuous way.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the range ranges from deep purple to folk song stuff.
Only towards the end is the overturned performance a little calm, and Winkler's subsequent absurd humour flashes.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying Highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that finds place in the dashboard of every car.
The devices that record every kilometre and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the obsolete system for financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly opened an intensive debate with colorful alliances.
Liberators have been associated with environmental groups and are in favour of the government using the small boxes to record the dangerous kilometres – and possibly where they were driven – and then using the information to calculate tax decisions.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Law Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
However, while there is no agreement in the congress, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system where drivers pay per mile per drive over the next ten years.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing we may use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, planning a record of the miles driven by all California car drivers in the state from 2025 onwards.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is here.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed from the taxes paid by US Americans at the post office, is called for.
In America, however, it is not as much done as it used to be.
Cars consume less petrol.
State mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Policymakers do not dare to raise the tax at high prices, even in order to raise a cent.
"The petrol tax is simply not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, an expert in traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most long-term alternative," he said.
Office Crats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals is coming up, for example, because the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
The California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally embedded goals of the state for climate change.
However, Republican Bill Shutter from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also explained that he sees in it the most common long-term alternative.
Also the free marketers of the Reason Foundation are inspired by the idea of having drivers pay according to the distance covered.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," says Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Reason's guidelines.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who, in a report in 2011, had asked the Congress to move towards milestone-based settlement.
The U.S. Senate approved last year a $90 million pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance and thereby responded to the concerns expressed by MEPs from rural areas representing people who often have to lay many miles on the road to work or to the city in everyday life.
However, several states and major cities are moving on their own in this direction.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the Transport Ministers of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, drivers were skeptical in thinking that the government could pursue any of their movements.
"Conclusions against Big Brother and such things were a major problem," explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management at the Transport Ministry of Nevada.
People didn't want it.
When the test was in progress, the ACLU warned Nevada on their website: "It would be relatively easy to transform the tachographs into adult surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a number of states that now look forward to affordable technology, with which the state can capture the miles driven, but not exactly when and where.
With that, so Khan, the public would be more calmed.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not enter to help states with the taxation of motorists.
Rather, it was their goal to step up a emerging market for car insurance where drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles driven.
However, the devices tested by it are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information, which is regularly uploaded by modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speeds and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programmes, major mistakes have been made.
There are much cheaper and less intuitive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners experiment with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not select a device at all and pay a flat rate instead based on the average miles driven by all residents of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation, with which parking charges can also be paid, insurance must only be paid for driven kilometers and speed data are collected from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.
"A car driver would be motivated by the added value of the advantages offered by the system for participation", says a city planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction maneuver.
During the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials stated that Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or an annual charge could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, Head of Law and Public Affairs of the Commission.
When we do, hundreds of millions of drivers are concerned about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beats waker
The volunteer fire brigade occupied its autumn main test despite lack of personnel with Bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
In his practice, department commander Hans Kammerer had selected the property Feder in Burgberger Straße.
There should have been a short closure when sawing.
The resulting fire and the development of smoke injured two people, one of them being able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two Wehr breath protectors prepared to enter the building.
After a short period of time, it was possible to find the first person and lead him into the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a tight staircase was too to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also strawballs in it.
There were also electrical machinery for woodworking.
The first discharge attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line took place via a flood-hydrant at approximately 100 meters away.
Now three extinguishing attacks could be designed.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise in showing what is to be achieved with little staff available.
In the case of serious cases, support is provided via the Königsfeld daily deployment group.
The commander showed himself satisfied with the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
On his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district, President Guido Wolf was informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers came from tomorrow.
In the funding centre Hochschwarzwald, he went into this important question together with the executive school leaders of the vocational schools as well as the district gymnasium and the parents' advisory board chairmen.
"Education is an important location factor," said Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thomas School, who presented the networked school project Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model training projects.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre, the Kreisgymnasium and the vocational school centre.
He also praised the family friendliness in the district.
"It is important not only to have a look at the family phase but also to take care of family care due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also argued that more and more employees cared for the care and care of their families.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to employment," Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already met the advantages of the region during their studies, their acquired knowledge and abilities often remain the regional economy, which contributes to strengthening the region," the Landtagspresent stated.
Only if sufficient training places were offered could the need for skilled staff be met.
In his opinion, the district's advantage is its beneficial location in the south-west of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his rail journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made to increase public transport.
"Stay persistent and ensure better public transport," he said to the local politicians.
Experience a fun afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has invited the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a Vesper.
In the past, older citizens were visited in the rest.
In the meantime this afternoon takes place at the nursing home of St. Josef.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were entertained with popular melodies.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front-line of the old schoolyard to the Kirchstraße, which is before the renovation, is to be re-established on the renovation cost plan of the city of Brunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small corner wall was built in during the first works of the renovation of the front schoolyard, for the stabilisation and static relief of the natural stone wall with balustrade over a hundred years.
Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, said that the further action is to involve the State Monumental Office in planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
The aim is to calculate costs by experts who will then be put on the table to the municipal council for the decision and definition of further action.
A decision on this is expected to be made in the coming year.
After the renovation, patching and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two lateral wings of the school built in 1912, it is necessary, in the foreseeable future, to renovate the needy limit wall from the ground and to place it on a new base.
The historic, a century-old barrier wall of the old schoolyard to the church street, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage need to be reorganisation and has a bowing forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones indicate weather damage, but the wall is currently not endangered.
A standing wall is a prerequisite for one of students using school yards, which is done by the current fortifications.
Originally, the school yard renovation was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures led to a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming, will be part of the State Monumental Office.
If specifications come from this side, the city hopes for grants from the monumentists.
The students of the Bräunlinger Grundschule, who are now being taught again in a well renovated old school building with new aula, can soon use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now joined the ongoing discussions on the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it's wrong to give up holistic training at the Stuttgart Music University," Özdemir said the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location Stuttgart.
Özdemir, who is considered to be the favourite of a direct mandate at the Bundestag elections on 22 September, is the Green-Red State Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this forces a reorganisation of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
Among other things, the Jazz and Pop programme will be transferred from the Stuttgart Musikhochschule to the Mannheim Musikhochschule.
US border: Super tunnel discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and stopped a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the U.S. customs authorities reported, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail rails and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were then arrested, eight tons of marijuana seized, and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine.
According to the information, the tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar," said the US district attorney Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where it had been discovered an end of the tunnel.
To the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent campaign against the drug cartel.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Because of the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the researchers assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that construction took about a year.
The rail system was so equipped that electric vehicles could be used there.
On the Mexican side, there is access in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width.
He would also have been able to promote illegal immigration towards the USA.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was taken because of the confiscated marijuana.
All three threatened as a maximum penalty for life-long liberation, as officials said.
Since 2006 eight such tunnels have been discovered, it has continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel building.
Usually cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not by tunnel.
This shows the "difference" of the drug gangs whose traditional routes are now cut off, said Bill Sherman of the drug abuse DEA in San Diego.
You'd do anything to get to the US.
No details were given to the arrested, at least one was Mexican, it was called.
They must expect up to ten years' imprisonment.
2014 will be Geisinger Year of the Year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250th anniversary.
Repeating the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year ends in more than eight weeks, the anniversary year begins.
Geisingen and church houses were first mentioned together in 794.
In churches a document was produced, in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this launch event will take place in the village, where in 1250 years ago both were mentioned for the first time, in church houses.
During the anniversary several events are planned both in Geisingen and in Kirchen-Hausen.
Church Houses will be in 1250 in July on a weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a banquet, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
At this weekend is also the church festival.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sonnwennfeier des Schwarzwaldvereins, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date will be the last September weekend, on 27 and 28 September.
A new chronicle is also released on the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee.
"But it should be a chronicle not only of Geisingen himself, but a printed work about the hostages of today, consisting of hostages, church houses, leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And the hostage of today celebrates its birthday in 2014 and today's spatialization has been carried out in 1974.
The new chronicle will then be presented in the new Festhalle in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November.
But 2014 is also another year with many jubilies.
The Narrenzuft Strohglonki begins on February 8th with a customs evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen will be 90 years and has the banquet on March 29th and will celebrate the District Music Festival from May 1 to 4.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen becomes 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen becomes 150 years old and celebrates this at the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was produced in churches (houses), which was a court of law at that time.
Both municipalities are thus mentioned in the same document.
Due to celebrating this 1250-year-old in 2014, the municipal reform is also 40 years back.
Council takes track systems into view
Should the railway crossing "Am deer" be elaborated in order to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the councils decided.
Schiltach has to take 220 000 euros to that end.
The Deutsche Bahn plans to improve the Kinzigtal railways next year.
In particular, safety at rail crossings is expected to be increased - there are frequent collisions of trains with other vehicles across Germany.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they will have to participate in the costs by one third, the rest of them will be allocated to the railways and the federal government.
Schiltach's city builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the special features of the Bah crossing "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build an outbook at the altitude of the tunnel mouth west of the railway track.
There could also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, on counter-traffic, without having to block the tracks.
Grüßhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could spread the road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was debated controversially in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for street dissemination: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, put the critics' moods at the point: "Do we have to take so much money into hand because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The railway crossing "Hirschen" was used regularly for long-wood transports.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" is partly transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route on the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn to the main road.
In addition, the route serves as redirection for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is locked, Haas argued.
The fact that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels had to be rebuilt and restored, as is the case in Wolfach, could also be used for a longer period of time for the railway crossing "Hirschen".
The councils agreed to investigate the costs of the intended spread of the road.
In spite of this, the conversion of the railway crossing was largely agreed with the condition that the required support wall would be built in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" to approximately 5.5 metres for convening traffic.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a completely different problem affecting the access to the strongly increasing "geroltzhäuserweg".
The management had examined the conversion plans of the railways from the engineering office Breinlinger, since she had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would be possible without further delay.
The investigation concluded that it would not be excluded that the road’s inclination conditions could lead to longer vehicles sitting up.
In turn, the responsibility for this is to carry the city as a road builder.
The conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the logging and the bending functioned in the current state of expansion, Haas was not to be agreed with the conversion of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
At this point the risk of collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition would also be significantly lower than that of the other rail crossings, because there is directly next to the stop point in the middle to which a good visual connection exists.
Even trains from the main station would have to be slowed down to the point that no collision would threaten.
Most of the approval was denied to the reconstruction of this railway crossing, since the city of Schiltach had to "swift out" the problem with upswing vehicles, the councils said, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of construction work.
As an unproblematically, the body considers the conversions to the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" for which crossing agreements have already been reached with the railway.
Esa decides on major space missions: Missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - European space agency experts now have to agree on two major projects that they want to start in the coming years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether or not there's life on some of them, nobody knows.
The selection is difficult: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or to the earthlike planets, perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These questions are addressed precisely by those responsible for the European Space Agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are to make decisive progress in research.
The budget for such "L-missions" is about one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were on the debate, five of them have now come into the narrower election.
Many bodies examine the proposals, check with the researchers.
In the next few days a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions have been selected by the Esa, to which the missions of the 2007 initiated programme "Cosmic Vision" are to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and hence also the formation of planets surrounding these stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
To answer this question, the space telescope "Cheops" will start in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems are being studied more closely in our vicinity.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could picture earthlike planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, looking for "biomarkers": gases, which are considered an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is ultimately intended to determine the conditions for the creation of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation from it with the planetary system.
These processes can be examined exemplaryly in our solar system.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe will start in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in developing the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa foresees the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision programme.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later it reaches Jupiter and is intended to investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead the physicists to a new theory, under whose roof all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe originate and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to our common matter, which consists of stars, planets and living beings like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, which accelerates the expansion of the universe.
To date, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the Big Bang, nor what Dark Matter and Dark Energy consist of.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already approved an M mission here, which is planned to launch for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe in the entire sky for the first time, thus enabling conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the competition.
According to many experts, the best chances for a permit as an L mission are "E-Lisa", a demanding concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
Among them, physicists understand changes in the structure of the space period that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proved to this day.
Elisha could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides a two or three probe detector that is stationed in space.
In contrast to plants on earth, it could also demonstrate gravitational waves that arose during the Big Bang and thus provide new insights into the emergence of the Cosmos.
Four further proposals compete for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is intended to investigate black holes, including "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and investigate earth-like planets.
Among other things, proposals for sample return transport from Mars, for the exploration of moon, Venus and asteroids, and for solar physics are already eliminated.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany in relation to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the US intelligence service, explained that he was willing to travel to Berlin and declare before the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and their director Keith Alexander did not provide any answers about their activities.
German Member Hans-Christian Stroebele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this asylum was granted to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: "Even if the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my government continues to treat a disparate opinion as a fidelity and attempts to criminalise political opinion with impunity which cannot be defended."
The truth to say is not a crime.
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The charge filed by the U.S. Ministry of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to Time Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make this possible."
The relations between the USA and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA had heard the cell phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member of the Parliamentary Committee responsible for the intelligence department, said that the opportunity should be taken to listen to snowden as a witness, if this is possible, 'without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the USA'.
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Strobele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden, if he leaves the country, he cannot return to Russia.
If Snowden says that he is in Germany, he needs a assurance that he is "safe" there, says the honourable Member.
In his letter, Snowden explains that he was subjected to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that had expelled him from his homeland.
However, he was touched by the worldwide response to 'my act of political opinion'.
Citizens around the world and high-ranking politicians, including in the United States, have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden offers cooperation to the German authorities 'when the problems surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved'.
Frontier Airlines collects fees for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or soda, even if in the announcement on Wednesday it was possible for passengers to keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontiers said that if the fee was paid in advance, they were reported to be 25 US dollars, and 100 US dollars for travellers who paid only on the flight platform.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said the fee of 100 US dollars aims to move travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she said.
Airlines started to charge for the first and second baggage item for 2008.
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore stuffed as much as possible into the hand luggage, resulting in the fact that the luggage compartments over the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a possibility to move passengers to take less with them on board.
O'Malley said that at the new fee it's not really about making money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier who have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the subject above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that if a passenger at the flight platform of Frontier may carry a luggage for free, the next person will have to pay 100 dollars for a comparable luggage.
O'Malley stated that Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they came to the flight platform.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee will only enter into force in summer, an accurate date is not yet available.
Passengers often complain about luggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that the transport of luggage should pay money costs and passengers should pay this service if they wish it.
Many on Wall Street consider the new luggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the cost of travel after years of losses.
However, most have so far left their fingers for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded a first fee three years ago for hand luggage and later Allegian Air, also a low-cost plane.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who carefully followed the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand luggage fee would cost Spirit 50 million US dollars annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a management position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with spirit and was curious about what would be expected on the flight platform if passengers were confronted with the unusual hand luggage fee of the company.
"The boarding process was one of the most smooth I've experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see dental gnashings and handcuffed discussions on the airway.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran like slumbered."
Frontier also follows Spirit at the 2 dollars that are required for coffee, tea, limonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought soda or juice should keep the whole can and coffee will be replenished free of charge.
Water is still free.
In 2008, US Airways had just tried to demand money for soft drinks, but seven months later it returned after passengers had complained and no other large company had moved.
Frontiers step to charge hand luggage charges if passengers are not buying directly from the airline, is the latest initiative with which customers should be directed to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to buy them directly instead of via an online travel agency.
Frontiers have, however, gone the most far way in this area.
In September, the company began to grant only half so many flight miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday the miles were reduced again to 25 percent of the flight route.
A flight with Frontier over 1,000 miles booked with a third party is therefore only 250 miles away.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when buying directly on the website of Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The proceeds fell by 9 percent and the flight capacity decreased almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as shown in the financial report published by the parent group, Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
Republic has tried to get the finances of Frontiers under the sale of the company.
Words of Proverbs Come From the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last woman breakfast this year in the Protestant church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the community house were "words from the Bible" and "reuses from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, chairman of the church council, went in after breakfast in a talk on the Bible’s proverbs.
"Passwords contain lifestyles, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called sayings like, "Hust eye be alert, as scales fall from the eyes, to throw an eye on someone, to whom the Lord gives it in sleep, to wash his hands in innocence."
On several occasions the speaker also advised their listeners about what saying it was.
The medieval church councillor Christel Dehner took up the speeches: All the good things are three, blue making, a little embroidered.
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called "bridges to the past".
Finally, a tombola was delivered.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously defined before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round were mayors Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for the unskilled in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is launched on the Mecklenburg Lakes Plate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as an uneducated in the industry will be qualified by experts for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"New is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert from the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits were varied: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would receive trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also includes the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gastättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains that an "internal error" and not hackers are guilty of the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency declared on late Friday that an error had paralysed its public site for a few hours and not hackers, as claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not reachable for a few hours this night because an internal error occurred during a planned update," the spy agency explained in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early hours of the evening, online server trackers have noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and this is not for some users either.
Before that, a NSA spokesperson had explained to ABC News that the authority's sensitive internal network was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information was not in danger, says the speaker.
At least a group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with site calls until the servers are overloaded and the website is merged.
Cybertactics is relatively simple and the attacks are not used to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname once was No Search Agency (no such authority), is now in the bright light of the public and is exposed to the revelations about its extensive monitoring program in Germany and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about intelligence fired initial speculations about the fact that the incident today is the result of a targeted cyberoperation.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October by 22 to 1.307.
Although the quota was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we had hoped for more," says Monika Feld-Bauer, Deputy Head of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Many companies have so far responded to attitudes.
One reason for this is according to field farmers: "We have hardly any skilled workers in crafts, health care and old-age care".
Seasons since September, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant sectors are also in progress.
The winter season begins in mid-December.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäuer display sheet of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Loss of profit at Bombardiers after decrease in delivery numbers and orders
On Thursday, Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decrease in net profit, after having been under pressure from falling orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier based in Montreal also did not publish a flight test data for his brand new aircraft of the CSeries and did not provide any new information about whether the aircraft could enter commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
On the flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago, only three additional take-offs followed, which makes it appear questionable whether the test phase is as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a price fall of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment of "outperform" to "sectoral performance" on Thursday in order to ensure that the stock has limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
"Although weaker delivery figures were expected for aircraft, we are quite clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical towards the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time after months of delays in September.
However, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 moderates have so far been made, as potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see whether the Company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet aircraft are applicable.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
President Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
The management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the programme was in the timetable.
"The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added, during the time of the aircraft's stay, ground tests and software updates had been started.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then hang on a review period, whatever we have done.
This is happening throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly thereafter, it was called from the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether twelve months after the first customer's young flight a CSeries aircraft can take into service.
Bombardier said it reviewed the planning for commissioning (EIS) and would update it in the next months.
"The slow progress of the flight test – even if it is obviously in line with Bombardier's internal planning – strengthens our view that commissioning is moving to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30th, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cents unchanged.
Turnover declined slightly from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The amount of orders in the aviation and space sectors was 32.9 billion dollars on 30 September and was thus unchanged compared to 31 December.
"In the field of airspace, the results were in the context of our requirements, but the low order intake and the overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this segment increased by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order stock in the transport sector was 32.6 billion dollars on 30 September and was thus slightly increased compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the area of transport has been affected by resolution problems in some major contracts.
According to corporate governance, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In midday trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share was 8.5 percent lower and amounted to 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that the Google Financial Officer Patrick Pichette will switch to the Board of Directors.
The Brazilian embryo SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's narrowest rival, reported a ten percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday.
USA: Shooting at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown man fired shots on Friday morning (local time) at LAX Airport.
While the airport management on the short news service told Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A securityman had also been killed.
Media also reported several injured people.
US President Barack Obama was constantly informed of the situation, said the White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses indicated that they had seen a gun with a gun in one of the departure halls as several media reported.
A traveler told the station CNN that many people were looking for protection in panic.
Travellers would have screamed and cried children.
Panic had broken out among the waiting people, many had hidden behind chairs out of fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler from the Los Angeles Times.
A TSA member of the security authority suffered a fire injury at the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
After that he had been taken to a security area himself, the man reported.
The shots should have fallen near a security control area.
Evacuated Airport Building
On television, there was a number of health and police cars in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were put in safety from the building.
Users on Twitter published photos of a special deployment command and a rifle lying on the ground.
The incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time) as the airport management informed via Twitter.
The access roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, formed long retrofits.
It was said that air traffic had been temporarily stopped until landings.
However, on CNN several flights were also observed at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines.
The LAX airport of Los Angeles is a major airport in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer, who warned drug forest against police investigation, must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to Underworld Size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug dependence could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender, who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be exposed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, supplied the underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own coke search.
He was arrested at his home in 2011 as a "first-class" lawyer with the nickname "Bash" after the police had monitored Scarborough who he had represented in an earlier drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, the Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a law court meal.
The investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed drugs in class A after the tests of cocaine had been found in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in the context of a major investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trafficking in the country, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured a number of home searches of heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared that his drug dependence could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Forbes Solicitors firm in Blackburn, was found guilty and condemned at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for the disability of justice.
He admitted cocaine possession in a previous survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's trash.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, got the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
Before court, it was announced that Datta was a regular consumer of cocaine, after testing drugs of Class A in his hair, wallet and credit cards had been discovered.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed that her discussion was subject to the 'administrative secrecy'.
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he was operating under his private address as well as at the workplace an office and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
Before court, it was announced that he had called out important players in the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: "A criminal attorney should know better than everyone else that you don't break the law."
Ditta is charged with the abuse of his position as a criminal defender, since he has been too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but rather a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
A part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate because he was the lawyer of these individuals.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He acted as far as possible against police investigations so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus brought his profession to trial.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta pointed out every misbehavior and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately."
However, after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead said of the Lancashire Police: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step from a criminal to a criminal at the moment he started to buy drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine dependence led to hopeless compromises and made him vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organized crime, who commissioned him to collect valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public.
Ditta has lost this confidence and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a sentence in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and the prevention of justice, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to trial.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can withdraw from the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared himself guilty of the conspiracy to the heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to 153 years total punishment for drug offences.
On his website Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, in which he claimed his dream job was to represent as lawyer clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Muhammad Ali and chance inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
At the conclusion of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Dunningen Liederkranz will frame two religious services with Franz Schubert's "German Mass".
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which inspired the audience in spring this year, at the end of the anniversary year, the Liederkranz will enrich two divine services with the performance of Franz Schubert's Deutsche Messe.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary fair will be held at the evening fair at St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, starting at 10.15 a.m. at the Mass at St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.
The so-called German fair with the original title "Sings for the Celebration of the Holy Victim of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of the formation.
The fair is presented in the context of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the group of brass clubs of the Musikverein Frohsin Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism deviates by watching confidence
The 2015 parish council elections will change, for example, in the Haslach (SE) Seal Care Unit.
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
There is nothing to change in the basic decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactory as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the skepticism towards the New One deviates reluctantly but watching a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the very constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the soul care team ranged.
On the basis of a presentation, regional dean Georg Schmitt presented the new guidelines for soul care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
After that, the SE Haslach as a church community will in future form a body of public law, which enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities so far.
There will be only one joint parish council and a foundation council in which the parish priest is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, six parishioners are formed on site so-called community teams.
Their task will be to promote the ecclesial life in the locality in the future.
The question of the finances of the individual parish then showed a great need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated funds remain assigned in the parishes.
On the other hand, the liabilities are transferred to the whole community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then all parishes meet, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only projects that could be occupied by the individual parishes alone have been invested," said Haslach's parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the Schutterwald-Neuried Soil Care Unit.
They had made themselves a task in 2006, "Becoming one, five stay" and had to realize that this is not so easy at all.
The bodies of the Haslach soul care unit then made themselves aware of the questions regarding the future composition and size of the joint parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be specified in further meetings and adopted in another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Plullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Plullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a family of four heads of Publlendorfer family have a cost of 70 to 90 euros per year.
The rise in the so-called EEC revenue from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour is a major reason for the upcoming price increase.
In October each year, the four operators of the major electricity grids re-set this levy.
These are the additional costs incurred by them from the energy turnaround, which they can charge through a charge over the electricity price.
The cityworks of Pullendorf form the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company had even assumed a higher rate of payment, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We go from an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, where the number is more close to the 2 cents.
Ampel on permanent red: Watch out for waiting time
Sometimes a traffic lights just don't get green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What are you supposed to do - go on red?
If a victim has waited long enough for a red traffic light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting period must be "appropriate", which can be interpreted differently from the case to the case.
Becker advises to endure for at least five minutes before the traffic of the traffic lights is affected.
However, anyone who continues the journey despite red light must be aware that he is fully blamed for an accident caused by it.
Those who wait less than five minutes may not wait long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Oberlandesgericht Hamm.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes of permanent red, a driver had ignored the traffic lights and had to take responsibility for a negligent red light breach.
The traffic lights were not defective, but they turned to green a little later.
A driving ban remained on him because of the special situation - but the fine did not.
The municipal council is happy about a solid household
Whenever it comes to household council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipality's bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not been aware of the debt since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be recorded as a full success in this respect.
This became clear in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was more than EUR 7.6 million higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around 1.8 million euros higher than the approach.
The main reason for this is that the surplus is mainly higher business tax revenue and the proportion of income tax in the municipality.
The wealth budget was again clearly above the planned values.
Instead of EUR 1.5 million, it amounted to EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As investments were less than planned in the financial year 2012, there was also a higher increase in the amount of the reserve injection.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake such a work out of the sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual bill.
He and the councils were happy to see the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but just these good figures could soon cost the citizens.
The good financial situation enabled the congregation in the past to refrain from high lifting rates.
In turn, according to Gerster, subsidies had already been cut off from the country.
There are conditions for these grants from various compensation points.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain lifting rates.
"We need to look at the issue of lifting rates as investments for which we like to have grants in the coming years" announced Gerster in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter has been in the choir for 60 years
At the age of 60, Hubert Wermter's story at the men's singing club Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colours of his male singing club.
Even after 60 years, singing with the choir won more than love is still great fun for him.
In the club Wermter was also active, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and fidelity: Jörg Kohr, Pastoralreferent on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed over to him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singers handed him the certificate of the German choir band and a engraved tint.
In addition to the honor, the 31st Autumn Festival was held in the usual tracks: With the MGV Betra, the song wreath Salzstetten, the singer's department Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmaringer had loaded a colorful mix of different choirs and vocal styles that entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "In the Wine Paradise" and "Lustig, her Brothers".
Her honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared a small booth for honour - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing club Betra also sang classical choir songs such as "Jägbekaufen" by Julius Wengert, "Wiet, Weiß" by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song "When you pass through the valley".
With its mixed choir and women's group - the "imulschor" - the Salzstetten Liederkranz provided for the women's rate of the festival.
The mixed choir abducted with the Neapolitan folk style "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "impulsor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singer's department of the Baisinger Sports Club came back with "Wasisch der Schwab?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papiert's "Bierlied" back to local territory, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" a.k.a. Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a casperl theatre and read a few stories that the children were working well for lunch.
Children's Dreams Become True
The kindergartens and kindergartens in the Zollernalbkreis receive post these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote wants to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and beautification requests.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
In the action, all kindergartens, day care centres and children's corpus from the whole of the customs elf can participate.
If you have a construction or beautification request for your decor, you can apply with this at the Schwarzwouder Boten.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action Kindergarten building site.
A jury consisting of representatives of Schwarzwouder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The desire should be achieved with building material worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide many diligent builders.
What about the Day of Action and the Helpers?
Bauhaus, with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb, provides the material.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"We are in an alarming situation and we can ask ourselves: what does Parliament consider simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?" was read in the paper which considered the draft law unconstitutional.
"The law is draconic and very punishing and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new media gallery "will always be preconceived, because it is an extended government arm", and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we call on him to reject this bill and return it to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government, through the new law, takes the media into an effective grip, whereas The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya have suffered 'a severe blow', and titled the draft as 'draconic'.
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of armed Islamists' attacks on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media drew on the anger of the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras on which the units sent to the crime scene were said to rob the luxurious shopping center.
Chief of Police David Kimaiyo responded with the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the pre-load was withdrawn after a riot of the media.
According to the new law, media houses can be occupied with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the parties if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, 'his only punishment can push most of the radio stations into bankruptcy'.
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have an destructive effect on Kenya's description of their 'living blogosphere'.
If they broke the media to silence, politicians could do whatever they want.
"No one will ever experience it," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist at the nation, which describes Kenyan media as a decisive control factor in public life.
"If politicians leave themselves, they will lead the country into bankruptcy and return us to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators already in the past drew on public anger.
In May they agreed to reverse the cuts ordered by the national remuneration commission and to re-establish their fine salaries of about 532,000 Schilling tax-free per month – they are among the world's highest.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream becomes true for the FC
The significance for the city and the football club was not included in the official initiation celebration for the artificial grass sports field despite the cold weather and the rain.
A more pleasant celebration would have all wanted on Saturday, but Peter did not want to play with it.
Thus all those who came without umbrella or could not hold such a for any reason.
This was done by the musicians who framed the ceremony, as well as by some speakers.
Wess was therefore also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke about the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were first of all mayor Walter Klumpp, who was very committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the participating companies and club members who came in.
Here especially Lothar Held, Paul Wizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The scaffolding pensioners moved 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable honorary commitment was also appreciated by Landtagsdepartmente Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were made for the urban sports committee Hubert Baier, the district president of the South Bade football association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the club's youth department.
Mayor Klumpp reminded us that in spring and autumn time and again, weather-related influences added to the original lawn square in such a way that he could not be played.
15 years ago, there was the first thought about solving the problem when the construction of a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the real school at the Salinensee was planned.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts arose about the creation of an artificial grass sports field, which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning was started two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, committed a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the site and approved the country’s funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros at the total cost of 560 000 euros, together Klumpp.
The construction started at the 68 x 108 meter artificial grass site on June 4th.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic metres of earth were removed, half of which was used for the installation of a Dirt-Bike track.
Union and SPD continued their coalition negotiations on internal and judicial matters.
To this end, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, we are talking about direct democracy, parliamentary investigation and the federal police.
The Working Group on Migration and Integration wanted to continue its deliberations in the morning.
Among other things, the issue of double citizenship, in which both sides have opposite ideas, should be discussed.
The SPD wants to end the coercion of migrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union refuses a double pass.
With regard to traffic, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD supported its No to a passenger car toll requested by the CSU.
A Vignette is a "flatrate for a variety of things and thus ecologically counterproductive," said the SPD negotiator on the topic of transport, Florian Pronold, in writing to his group.
There was a threat of eviction on land roads, which are already a major accident issue.
Moreover, the introduction of a toll for all cars would only be a first step from the point of view of Pronolds.
"There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be abolished at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing Föhnwelle on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be true summer again?" was not really the question on Friday evening on the open-air stage Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best conditions for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Car drivers seriously injured in the event of an accident
In the event of an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old passenger car driver from Aachen has been severely injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on her way with her car on the Kempen outer ring towards Grefrath.
When they wanted to turn left onto St. Toniser's road, she overcame the opposing car of the 37-year-old.
The driving saw collided.
The Aachener suffered severe injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constanz: Locking after accident at the scaffolding circle
The accident was due to the police when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on the left lane of the two-track Reichenaustraße on Thursday evening, at around 8 p.m.
Shortly before the circuit at Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left-hand trail towards Strotleyersdorfstraße and changed to the right-hand lane.
This was the result of a collision with BMW's 23-year-old constanzer.
Also damaged was the VW Passat of a 19-year-old, driving behind the BMW.
The police reported some 15000 damage to property.
The road had to be locked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport manages passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In future, there will not be any transparencys like these at Vienna-Schwechat Airport anymore.
A large part of the speakers are thus missing - the noise level is to be so clearly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As the airport spokesperson Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the setting of breakthroughs affecting individuals.
Among other things, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai have already failed to make the noisey calls.
Due to the loss of these passages - on average, on one day about 200 personal calls by the speakers - it should go calmer in the future at the airport.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual diameters were relatively little perceived, but at the same time also all other information about changed flight climbs or departure times go down here a bit," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander-Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the tractor train with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7th, start the Highlander Games at 1.30 pm.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swably inflamed at the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters are measured in the disciplines tree trunks, hoofs and water buckets.
Four and a half metres long is the tree trunk and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It doesn't go far," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be thrown down perpendicularly, should hit itself once and then come to lie down.
This is assessed with most points.
It is the goal accuracy when throwing hoof iron.
From eight meters away, throws onto a plough.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in water emitting over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team, two may participate in the single competition.
The winners of the team and individual wage competition receive prizes.
You can be trained at 10 a.m.
Desired is a suitable clothing, for example, the fighters can enter the Scottish rock.
But also Swabian wear is allowed.
For the "Outfit" the jury awards a few bonus points.
You can log in up to an hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish- Swabian Highlander-Games and the tractor-pulling that starts half an hour earlier, there is a lot of action on the grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the brass music friends come at their expense.
At 7 p.m., the Brazilian Blasmusik from Schömberg designed the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fluent Polkas and Märsche.
Her repertoire also includes emotional whales and a rich band sound.
With it will be the singing host and black sausage baron known as Heinz Koch from the streams.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas Market and at the Narrenft.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten maintains the early stage, from 14 o'clock the Farmerkapelle Böfingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then make the feast sound out.
The stop-lacker party with DJ Ralf is already on Friday.
Other programme points include the Oldtimer and tortoise meetings, exhibitions by companies on agriculture and forestry.
Further attractions on Sunday are the corn labyrinth, the craftsman market and the sheepshering.
Especially for children there is a string zoo, Strohhhüpfburg, tractor rides (under instructions) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the Förderverein Multipurposehalle, the Ski Club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegane nutrition requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant cream, for example, is a quark replacement.
The Vegetarian League is also called the World Vegetarian Day on November 1.
On the occasion of the World Vegetarian Day on 1 November, the Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a series of vegetarian alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt let substitute for soyajoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, oats, almond or rice milk can be used.
Precipitable plant cream replaces conventional impact cream.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
Half a crushed, mature banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this purpose.
Lockers become dough instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams soyajoghurt or silk tofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, some 800 000 people are currently feeding vegans in Germany, i.e. pure plantation.
Sleepless in New York City
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Schwarzwald gymnasium met the American capital New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went straight to Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
Here already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which makes a special charm in the evening light.
Due to the shift of time, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The City does not sleep" the day was decided on Times Square.
Despite Shutdown on the second day, the Statue of Freedom could be reached with a ferry and be climbed on foot.
Afterwards, the financial center was about Wall Street to commemorate September 11th.
On the third day, students from the 373-metre-high view platform of Empire State Building were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city and enjoy the view.
After that it went through the hectic driving of the New York streets via the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for short stays in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience school everyday at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, a Hubertusmesse is celebrated in the parish church of St. Mary on Hülsbergstraße on the day of the Holy Hubertus.
St. Hubertus was the legend of a rather reckless hunter, who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn blower group of the hunting rider Westphalia under the direction of Brigitte Kluth is playing on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood It) according to old, originally French melodies.
The blowers wear equestrian clothing because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dogMutes on tow hunts.
The festive fair will take place on Sunday, 3 November at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed envelope shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name a program.
As Déjà Vu, according to Lexikon, a psychological phenomenon is described, expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of visiting the café of the same name at the summit in Kleve County, in sight of the Rhein-Waal University, it does not have to stay with the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that goal: to make an actual stay not only spiritual, but to make hand-fest ever repeatable.
Because it's fun and just beautiful.
A look into the inner life at the top 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at first.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool, café ambiente looks like a place to feel well-being.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years of age, have made a name already before the opening of the pretty café at the envelope as gastronomists: In Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the opschlag, the sympathetic café lovers hope to have more audiences.
Not least through the university.
"We have no specific target group," emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address as well as seniors and all age classes in between.
Apropos Café-Lover.
The friendly couple of owners is behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot tan in the various variations itself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"This is a baguette - that's my thing," the NRZ tells her.
There were two events in the bright café.
Better say one.
Because the Port Festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ringing night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny", found the two 33-year-olds.
But not everybody's thing.
Maybe Daniel Büttner is not a very special fan of event evenings either: "You can't do it all right."
And with an event I always only speak to those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception to us.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible".
It should be said: Déjà Vu stands for reliability as well.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as to the team and the beautiful surroundings at the pickup in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more into a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from close and far away and the students who discover the Gastromeile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to have come.
In the club room of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, all the harmonious co-existence enjoyed in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is always the right festivity to make honors.
This time, writer Rolf Wagener was delighted with the special award "Singer of the Year".
"You have not only written a lot for us, but have also made a number of rounds for us, our warm thanks," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the appearances and choral samples by means of an activity test went to the choir manager Dieter Schulze with 44 participants this year, followed by Honorary Chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
==References====External links==
A particularly thank you, the board of directors directed to the team of club manager Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had enchanted a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets its regular choral samples always on Tuesday at 7.45 pm at the club's venue.
"New singing voices are always welcome to us," says Schlotmann.
UN Announces New Goals in Combating Poverty
The United Nations will now begin to develop a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago in the fight against poverty.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the advance of "sustainable development goals" to replace the Millennium Goals that expired in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
In the evening, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon stated at the summit that the time had come to 'think beyond national interests'.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch a process with which universal, sustainable development objectives are to be agreed," he said.
“These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the framework for development after 2015.
I will not fail to implement this mandate given me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball obligors still have a good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that at all.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"For I don't know how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-party reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn out trees at the moment, Malmon is warning the toy finger in advance.
Many players I have trained myself in the A-Jugend.
Therefore, they will be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is to be expected whether reinforcement from the First One is still in place," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the success track, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous appearances.
Especially in the cover work and in the shift game, it was a huge thing.
Opportunity recovery must definitely be improved.
So I hope that my players will finally get their head free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of conflicts between influential individuals
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos under the alert eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of state and the first president of Mozambique to vote in a rare public demonstration of peace calls.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Out of fear for the future of the country, she has exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the title "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the independence place of the capital.
For two weeks, there have been reports of controversies between government forces and Renamo almost daily, which have been among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by the White- ruled Rhodes and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became a opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will fall back into an ageing conflict, but recent events have troubled foreign investors and locals.
The fast growing economy is much at stake because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring investments of over 50 billion US dollars from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA in the next few years.
The reigning Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government was provocating the recent clashes by attacking her members in the province of Sofala, a traditional city of Renamo, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo's base and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, said Renamo's spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to lower concerns about instability.
Against AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself to be a loser who wants "all of his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo gave up the 1992 peace agreement.
He said against the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
"Our vision is to start negotiations again and seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have contributed little to the settlement of tensions fired by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two grown-up men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who meet together," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good in negotiation and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who insists on election reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as the attempt of a grueling movement to achieve concessions and financial advantages from the government.
Renamo's election performance has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term of office ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the presidential office," says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but she has committed unrestful attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major North-South connection.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port, mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for one month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga replied to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warning the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
The instability has increased the frustration about the government, says Fernando Lima, Head of Mediacop, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about corruption, the slowing progress in development and a recent abduction wave.
"People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
"No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and useable roads again," he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as 'the models of life', says one author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal force has no chance against clever tricks," and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths were 'by far too wild, too obscene and, in some cases, too dirty to be taught in schools', which is why Crossley-Holland pleaded for a 'careful selection' of old-aged works.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that for authors and teachers who were 'over-dedactically' children would 'absorb completely', because in entertaining stories the messages would be 'under-sharpened'.
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from the Angelic and is the author of Penguin Book of Norwegian Myth and the British Folk Tales, said: "You can follow certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background if possible."
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything must be simplified or lead to a happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be under-represented, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the ancient story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved to his retirement home in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely boring scene game.
From the arrival of the award of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakobstarr Alois Kratzcyk had designed an entertaining piece, which under the direction of Cornelia Volk received much applause.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained interrelationships and overcrowded periods from youth to approaching retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's sky, into his courtyard.
And then the scene game began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his parade role as a great son of the city.
He was silently introduced by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach with the two-spanner and "Schwarwälder Füchsen".
He was not only welcomed by the audience with much applause, but also his sister Philippines welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to get into the sister's role and gave her tremendous life in Mimik and Gestik.
The Mühlenbach peasant chapel played well-selected pieces of music between the individual playing scenes and thus completed the performance.
Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler was honoured for the award of honorary citizenship, who, together with a part of the city council, made his expectation in the representation of the then governor Hattich.
Their anticipation then made the three-king singers, who led Hansjakob to the cry: "Oh how beautiful, youth memories of my own three-year-old age will come back to life."
With their song "O Jesus" they enjoyed the audience in the open court as well as the Storchentagskinden with their loud "Heraus, Heus.
Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the Church at the time, as did his concerns about the development of agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the home country, behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene game.
There was a lot of applause and many praiseful words from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of the Neckar Giants Grows
The chances of staying in the league of Ludwigsburger Bundesliga-Basketballers, who had gone down sporty, have increased.
Because there should be a Wildcard procedure, then there is for the Neckar Giants now a competitor less.
The Hamburg Towers Basketball project does not apply for a possible backyard.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard procedure," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
However, a first breathing was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure, so long as Düsseldorf is not licensed," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Up until 23 May, Aufsteer Düsseldorf Baskets can submit documents to the arbitration court and prove its economic federal league capability.
So far, however, the Rhine has been denied the licence twice.
The arbitration court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Abendmehlskirche moves into the vantage point
As a contribution to the city's 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office is dedicated to the last of its public tours on Sunday, 27th October, the Abendmehlskirche.
After the visit of the Atomic Cellar Museum, the Haigerlocher period was to be considered after 1850 when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning ending point is a visit to the Abendmehlskirche.
There the leaders get the story told about the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a through and through a Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also overlooks the evening meal prepared by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an organic reproduction of the famous Milanian model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point on the other half-hour tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomic Cellar Museum.
There are maps at the cash register of the Atomic Cellar Museum.
For questions and information, the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also declare in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the United States.
Representatives of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia.
This was notified by the Interfax Agency to non-denominated groups who were familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved intergovernmentally, it was said.
An exit of Snowden from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the Agency quoted her source.
Because Germany is ally of the USA, there is a threat of extradition there, it continued
Long breath pays off
Six men competed in the tennis tournament of the clubs for the winner title.
In the end, the endurance of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match.
The tennis department of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf had received a dream weather for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The tennis game was in the foreground of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against everyone.
It was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament lead was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler) so that the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to deliver the hiking cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish.
The second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmic.
Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team reached the bronze staircase.
In late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful voice of the tournament took place.
At the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwälder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach bei Hornberg is once again firmly located in Kinderhand.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturdays and Sundays, 24th and 25th August, as part of the summer holiday program, to a colorful children's and family festival with numerous participations and events.
"Great and small can learn different old crafts on both days," says the press release.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felt or ropes, for every age is the right thing to do.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 am to 5 pm.
The museum workshop also operates.
During the construction of cuckoo pipes, waterwheels or circles, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
A lot of fun also promises the many old games, such as wheel cart race or stilting.
Speed and coordination are needed here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 and 14 o'clock each, offers a tour of the museum.
On a tour of the grounds, children must guess what stories of truth are or what they are lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the Open Light Museum during a carriage with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens are found on the grounds and to be admired.
In addition, all children may look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, who drives his Schabernack from 11 o'clock with the museum guests.
This is a pleasant and fairytale experience with Hermann Büttner.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 3 pm.
In addition, the children's dance group from Gutach will present traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days of the event, from 11 to 17 o'clock, numerous artisans such as the broombinder, the neighbor, the spider, the weaver and the baker can be looked over the shoulder during their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the Freilichtmuseum await a varied holiday program.
In a New Zealand small town, Burt Muro is considered to be a lovely chew because he has undertaken to participate in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt is not to be removed from his dream despite a heart failure.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he transfers by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Piepsen bothers locals
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard relies on wind turbine logistics, among other things.
Black shimmers the coal in the storage area in front of the dike.
Two huge blue storage and rechargers distribute or load the coal here as needed.
With every movement of the envelopes a shrill warning noise sounds over the terrain.
"The signals serve security and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, with unfavourable wind, this is far to be heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city's north.
He took the actions very seriously and therefore contacted the parties concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities it is now possible to keep the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In future, he also put on the open dialogue with the neighbours.
Matthias Schrell still has a lot ahead of the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Rhineland bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the majors in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the thickness of 18.5 metres, the shape of the terminal can also be finished here for a long time with Capesize-Bulkcarrier.
"This year we want to crack the 3-million-tonne brand at the envelope," Schrell said.
In addition to the on-site Eon power plant, the imported coal goes to internal power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant goes to the grid, more than 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three ship dischargers on the bridge and the second transport belt could create up to 10 million.
Bavaria's basketball player despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague was not able to lessen the enormous optimism among the basketball players of the FC Bayern München.
"No one can forbid us to believe that even against the best team of Europe in the past two years," said Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening with champion Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
During their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichs sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first managed the piece of art to turn a 15-point back 13 minutes before finally into a tour before Piraeus gave the game another turn.
"We have fought in an incredible way against the double Euroleague champion, but we have made some careless mistakes again," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful pitchers of the Munichs, who in the first two matches against Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and Polish winner Zielona Góra had won a significant victory.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: just a hundred years ago, the Variete artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Conferencier at Palace Theatre on Broadway, started to tell the crowd about straight jokes in the form of a conversation.
In the course of the years, Fays has been expanded in innovation, as was the last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Stand-up Institute of Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were ever known to appear in a club," says Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as by "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy festival for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival the world of Comedy has also grown.
A number of the Medians who take part in the festival this year have become known through unconventional channels, such as broadcasts on smaller TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom in cable television (the ironic-slipping fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own Sketch show at Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation both at Saturday Night Live and at Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young Comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic W. Kaumau Bell concentrated on racial themes) are products of the decentralized world of the American Comedy.
One of the largest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up median, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a television show entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the town hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the Comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he was here, he sometimes goes through the alley between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran appears to be satisfied with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five U.N.s. and Germany.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to address the differences of the last years," Foreign Minister Muhammad Dshawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way to go, but the nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides will come to a solution at the end.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game game game comrades with machetes
Two children in Uruguay have committed the murder of an 11-year-old.
The two boys 14 and 12 years old had invited their victims to go on a bird hunt with them.
They armed the 11-year-olds with machetes and knives on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
They would then have played football before their apartments in a workers' district.
The body was found on the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As Alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the disciple whom she had taken should declare that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the Tahergang before the police without mentioning an attack against them, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder among other things called a rivality in football.
He was sent to a psychiatric youth centre for the time being.
Supplies must be taken to prison
Because of exploitative trafficking in human beings, custody, threat, insult and dangerous physical injury, the Landgericht Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three-and-a-half years in prison.
The former Federal Armed Force, who worked as a doorstep after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession in the context of a trial agreement.
So in five cases he met women about Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent against their will to the bar after a few weeks.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who partially bought for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he subverts the contacts of women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught the women, he brought them to various brothelles in the southwest.
There he had them partially monitored to control their revenues.
Before court, the defendant first claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died next to him during an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychological restriction and thus of limited debt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court did not have to hear any of the women who were injured.
According to one Kripo official, at least four other cases of exploitant trafficking could be identified after a first display by telephone surveillance measures.
The talks that had been heard had been marked by high aggression.
In later hearings, the injured would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness in which one of the women had discovered blue spots all over the body has so far made no statement.
It deals with "a completely broken personality", which sees violence and exploitation in this metier as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has dissolved himself from these circles and wants to live a normal life after the prison," he said.
Oil price continues up to USD 96 per barrel
The oil price continued to fall on Friday after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report according to which the Chinese energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil variety for deliveries in December had fallen in electronic commerce in Europe at the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in late morning.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a decrease in prices of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has burdened prices over the past few weeks.
The US Department of Energy declared on Wednesday that the US offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer had risen by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was evidence of increased demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China's economy, whose growth rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, after having reached the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Crude oil from the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil, which is also used by American refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to 108.58 USD per barrel.
Court blocks decision to stop and Frisk directive of NYPD
A Federal Court of Appeal in the USA blocked on Thursday the order of a judge who had requested changes to the Stop-and-Frsk-Programm ('resulting and searching') of the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. appeal court stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until the city was called.
The judge had judged in August that the city was in breach of the Constitution with the way in which the programme for the arrest and questioning of persons was implemented.
The city called against its assessment and the appropriate remedies, including the decision to set up a surveillance body to assist the police in amending their Directive and the relevant training programme.
The Appellate Court heard the arguments for suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be disbanded from the case, since it violated the code of conduct for U.S. judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality, partly based on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had judged police officers to violate the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were in an inappropriate way targeting black and Latin American men with the stop-and-fress program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of key changes, including reforms in guidelines, training and service oversight, and ordered a pilot program with cameras carried out on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police control.
An oral hearing on the appointment of the city is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The stop and Frisk tactics have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
There have been controls of this kind for decades in different forms, but the number of controls recorded during the term of office of partyless mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, all of them minorities, filed a case that developed into a collective complaint.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's Stop and Frisk program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and effective police and influence the way other police presidents use the regulation.
The opposition is of the opinion that the changes would dampen the police's morals, but not criminality; also wastes money and would not solve the wider problem of a police that, after thousands of jobs have been lost in the last decade, is under pressure.
The judge pointed out that they did not end the stop-and-frsk practice which was constitutional but only reformed the way the controls were implemented by the NYPD.
Happiness of dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that manages to reach only dreaming camels
The first president Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helenden Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the 10th anniversary of the club was celebrated, which can already have considerable success.
The first chairman, Henne, reported in detail about the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott in 2004.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and Gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on the spot on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the operations were shown on a large screen so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the actions mentioned above.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Protection Vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, plans to work at the association in consultative function.
In 2008, Kimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, an 11th quarter on the edge of the capital in the record period of just about a week.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times where the birth clinic is to be degraded in Nagold.
One learns a lot in Africa as a physician, says Henne, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Due to political unrest in the country, it was not possible to travel as many as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to hospitate here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, so in March this year medical equipment, medications, association material, hospital beds and glasses are sent.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered abundant local colorist by telling from Mauritania of Mercedes vehicles converted into mobile goatry and the experiences of the Stammheim musicians who traditionally supported the association on their Mauritania journey.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young Member.
When he realized how much money was lost on the road, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, fleets stressed that global economy also wants global human love.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
It's not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking for checking a hint
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson reportedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of Charles Clarke, Minister of the Interior at that time.
Procurator Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voice emails, and followed them, but Coulson also called them and left news as the court learned.
"In the opinion of the prosecutor's office, Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW, is not one who stands in front of people's homes and hopes to catch them on fresh deeds, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," said Edis.
He said NotW uses three procedures to invest stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can not be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He argues, but we say, "And he knew about it."
"Don't waste your time, it's with Charles."
A band with voice emails from her phone of at least three events was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's home.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
At the time of the search, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls asking for information about them, said Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Pawlby's movements.
On 18 June 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow that I would like to talk to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The sisters heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced a married woman because of an affair when he himself was a member of Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue that they have sworn to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup added the phone hacking.
From protest against the planned Reich tax, the French football will actually pass the first strike since 1972.
A settlement meeting ends without results.
The government and the professional football team in France have been manoeuvrified after a failed settlement meeting in a dead end.
The President, François Hollande, received the association and association representatives on Thursday at the Élysée-Palast, Paris, and heard their complaints.
However, he refused to sell the football of the planned 75 percent tax on incomes of more than one million euros per year, which all companies of the country are supposed to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November was also announced by the Chief Association of the Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The season in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between 29 November and 2 December is therefore not valid.
geschingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve residents in planning early," Mayor Jens Häussler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the measures planned, ask questions, express concerns and introduce ideas.
Heussler made it clear: "The final decisions fall the members of the municipal council".
The flood, which struck unprepared on 15 May 2009, had been an inciting event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, said Häussler.
A river basin investigation was commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The aim is to protect as many built-up plots as possible," said Häussler.
According to German weather service, the planning of protection against a high-water expected according to German weather service is based on statistically every 100 years.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 percent supplement.
In specialist circles this is called "HQ 100aClimate".
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häustler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aClimate, around four million euros must be invested in Geschingen, while the municipality can expect national grants of around 70 percent.
However, heustler pointed out that there is only support when a whole concept is implemented.
To this end, the community would be dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure had to be completed.
In the best case, implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which has already been presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the influx of the river Irm from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, participants took advantage of the opportunity to address their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and paddling pools were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, one would be kept to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
Illness existed in the airmen of the old town, who, even in the event of normal thunderstorms, have to suffer from an overload of the canal network.
The problem is known in the management and initial measures have already been taken.
However, Häustler pointed out that the directive on channel systems was different from that on flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rain events could be achieved.
The dimensioning of the wastewater canals would make millions worse.
Harassed after Controversy
On the Landesstraße 44 near Revendorf on Friday afternoon two drivers were seriously injured during a frontal collision.
The police locked the road immediately, but could say little at first to the accident.
However, there were various testimonies that should be evaluated first.
It is true that the 19-year-old driver of a VW golf drove towards Revendorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided together, with the woman being so hard hit that the fire brigade took almost half an hour to free them from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of accident remained unexplained at first.
Both of them were killed in nearby hospitals.
The route remained closed for about two hours.
You could call him the Dostoyevsky of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a deity seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and narratives also have something serial.
Astounding the external relationship: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who in his own country is well regarded as something.
Some titles have been published in the Heyne publishing house, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand.
Dick explains America - the kingdom of breathtaking technical progress, paired with paranoia, security arm and belief, to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drug addicted to his brain.
He got it early that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a computer's theology and asked what distinguished a person from a machine, the Creator from his creation.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minderheiten-Report" dates back to 1956, it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy-Tribune.
The principle of "pre-crime" is being developed here, i.e. what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which resembles our terrifying, mutants look into the future - and the police attack.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll get them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "In our society there are no heavy criminals, for this we have a criminal camp full of Pesudo criminals." You read time streams.
They assume that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Dick's narrative acts like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the noise of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: Obama's drone philosophy and practice also works.
But Dick's story hasn't ended yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no more division of violence, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the watchman himself is monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system is moving.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Not only does errors and sacrifices buy, but they build on it.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth again and again.
Sphericals about Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. law firm for Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Lawyers could ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-olds personally in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Before that, Hans-Christian Stroebele, the Green-Bundestag member, had met last night as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA envelopes strengthen company paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep across the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's capital of finance.
At the direction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Anti-Terrorism (BVT), the German Internal Secret Service, he should photograph the roof of the US Foreign Office, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, BAT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, again in September insisted that the United States did not use the possibilities of foreign spying "to steal the company secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies, so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profit."
However, since Edward Snowden, who became the Whistleblower, started publishing his full horn to US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director at the floor.
Reports by the U.S. National Security Agency spying out the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquired data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The barrel to overflow brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been intoxicated, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe is able to visit, then corporate management is certainly also a potential goal.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," explains Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, the small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US is now at almost the same risk as China when it comes to industrial spying and data theft, such a survey published in July by the Advisory Company EY.
However, there has been no evidence in the documents sent by Snowden that the United States passed on the company secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU should lack certain IT and Internet opportunities and reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"This doesn't work like this," says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
All except for the IT industry.
Nevertheless, range and technical refinery of US spy authorities exposed by the Snowden envelopes have shocked companies who had previously seen the greatest risk of spying in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to the relevant case law and is therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, about ten percent of the non-U.S. members were planning to use an American provider according to the revelations about US data mining activities with Prism.
Jim Snabe, deputy managing director of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers who didn't have it a year ago – it says: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they remain physically in this legal area?"
Many German business leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore they need to be monitored at any price.
The fact that economic spying takes place is not a surprise.
It's always been like that.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally by the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
The management usually does not boast of the countermeasures that have been taken, because this brings benefits to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been introduced to say that taking a free USB stick at a trade fair or leaving a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, Executive Board member of Automaker Audi, says that for years it has been part of the standard practice of collecting mobile phones in front of a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
German BAT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones were thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorised access," says the BVT in a report.
The United States warn its own companies of economic spying by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February France, Russia and Israel behind China, two of the countries serving to acquire the economic data of hacking were ranked in the US National Intelligence Estimat.
A member of the board of a German blue-chip company agreed when it comes to economic spying, then 'the French are the worst'.
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal secret service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The intelligence services know very well that even if they work together in the fight against terror, they are pioneering their allies."
Hechingen: Messe answers wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can make," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding party succeeds, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Retirement were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: the retro look has kept its way back.
This begins with the wedding clothes.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
The fronts are the often shredded and closed with embroidery, often with a veil, but back they go down the back and often end in a loop.
The ghosts, however, differ as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house dress trasher.
In men, the suit dominates with vest and plastic, but it can also be chosen cream-colored or brown combinations.
Important was the selection of the local, was explained.
Jewelless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the Remise.
If you want to proceed with the carriage, you have an offer for the Uwe Link.
"Cuts are also popular for female boys", he says.
Romance is also needed for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "After-Wedding-Photo" - i.e. recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a sorcerer, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Don't forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable celebration.
Dog Friends Successful
For the repeated time, the sportsmen of the dog friends Bitz were successful on a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Candel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in class beginner and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it with 87 points to 12th place.
With her woody in class 1, Susi Höpp presented himself the critical views of the performance judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in tragic accident believe in murder
The teenage parents, whose body was found in a rolled ringer mat in the gymnastics of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, declared the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in an upright mat standing behind the Tribune in the school gym.
The investigation officers of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which the 17-year-old's family doubted.
"They are convinced that her son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, Kenneth's lawyer and Jacquelyn Johnson, over FoxNews.com.
They would never have believed he died as the sheriff had concluded.
"They believe that it violates all logic, both the laws of physics and the common sense," says Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is covered up in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school and came back in the body bag," he comments.
US prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation of Johnson's death, as a number of important questions are still unexplained.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was explained by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy pointed out that Johnson had died from the consequences of "position-related suffocation".
A second autopsy, however, had caused another cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there were sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would order the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff authority was not ready to comment immediately on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities should release all surveillance videos that the investigators had reviewed.
The teenage parents said they were hoping that the video recordings included evidence of how he died.
Publish CDC Allergy Policy for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children at schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. Government, as the number of school-based children with food allergies increases.
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the teaching body and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrin in stock – the auto-injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – to address a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin in stock more easily.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms that are mentioned by children who have allergic reactions.
Children may say: 'It feels like something is pressing on my tongue', 'My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it' or 'My tongue'.
Parents of intersexual children can choose gender undetermined
Germany is the first European nation in which a third generation is recognized for children born with unremarked genitals.
Newborns are no longer given rigidly male or female.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to declare sex for such children, but can state "undetermined" or "undetermined" on birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding surgery for a gender allocation in newborns and fight against discrimination against intersexual people.
According to BBC, an intersexual person said years later: "I am neither man nor woman."
I'm staying the flickwork created by doctors mutilated and full of scars.
One of 2,000 children is estimated to be born neither as a boy nor as a girl each year.
They are among the intersexuals, a group covered by the diagnosis "Sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective concept for humans with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (eating sticks or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States recommend using the best available information on gender allocation if a provision is not possible, and do not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding – if at all – for an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specialises in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law was 'sounding for a good thing'.
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not have it," he said.
One could make a sexual assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
Scientific data on how a child develops his gender identity are not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are homosexual.
In a report to the European Commission dated 2011 it says that intersexual people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not gender-related, but based on their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersexual and transgender people face in their professional lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys who do not agree with the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate on official documents male, female or "third sex".
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "sexual" person after a court authorized the lifelong maintenance of a "undetermined" gender status.
In addition to M and W, German certificates have a third allocation, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, such a news message on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French Members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that gender theory should be removed from schoolbooks.
The US-American website Catholic Online also spoke out against the German law, stating: "If the world is distorted into a new state, where gender is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that she felt it better to assign a gender to babies at birth.
"The parent's existence is already stressful enough without any further restrictions, especially if you do not know the gender of your own child," she said to the parent's website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born both with male and female genders were called hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered gender to be something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
However, the ethical foundations of an operation are now being doubted, after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender assigned by them.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a 'psychiatric emergency'," Drescher said.
When such a child was born, you called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The ruling theory about the treatment of children with unreliable genitals dates back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University who held that gender is formable.
He coined the term "sexual identity" and argued, social and environmental abuses – as parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped as if a person considered himself to be male or female.
However, in a case known as John/John in 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off during a beaten circumcision, to cast the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which he was not," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male gender and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the entry of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have come to the public who are 'not happy with the result'.
For example, at Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY-man chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear as to whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never live a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I was not a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was to receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and nobody ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation has made him barren.
Today, he is fighting for other people in an organization called Interface Project to see intersexual people as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based lawyer for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law "can encourage stamping and stigmatizing".
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to "not define" the child," she said.
We are afraid that this will benefit intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don't know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law, because 'it enables adults to recognise as a third sex'.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law is about the assignment at birth.
That's not a fight to force small children at that time.
When they are grown up, they can decide for themselves about their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baraz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and who supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law "voting" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Barazin, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Katie developed female characteristics because of the recipe order defect of the target cells for testosterone.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the psychiatry.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a daisy mother.
"The law gives parents room to make decisions that do not have to be overcrowded," said Barrez.
It gives them time to make various tests and clarify things and thus give them time before they write 'male' or 'female'.
It's all right in this way – you grow up and love the child.
One has a wonderful baby and enjoys parental happiness.
And you don't have to make an operation that can't be reversed.
"This includes the children's decision and eliminates the fear that the parents are distraught because they think they wouldn't do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides on the gender that suits him better – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injured girls by shooting from car
Unknownly, a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt was injured in a car from Schüssen.
The perpetrators probably fired a group of children with an air pressure weapon on Thursday evening in Genthin.
That's what the police told us in Burg.
The girl had easily been injured at the left Wade.
Rescue staff took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove off.
The criminal police determined it was Friday.
Until now, police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice into egg-throwing children who threw them against household facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the eggs at the same time, no damage would have been caused either.
Furthermore, in the city area some Sylvesterböllers were also lit, but even here there is no damage to property.
A resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with claw paper and his wheeled blinds were removed.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found his wheeled blinds in close proximity to everyone, so the police did not have to continue to work.
Living with a future perspective
Waltraud Ries lives in a dreamlike way.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city it is only a few minutes by public transport.
"You're hopefully not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries and points to a bold spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the concern of being unable to cope with the many steps of stairs to the house and the apartment at the age, she explains.
In addition, since a Meniscus operation, the mid-fifty-sevener on his own body has had to know what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap.
A book by her recently appeared on the theme 'Lucky living in old age - Which living form is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what's not going on in old age, she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the greenery.
Today with the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
However, she also knows that she is one of the few people who are ever dealing with the theme of 'Living in the Age'.
Most dissipate it as long as it goes.
She says that old will always be just the others.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you think.
'Then it can be too late', says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for self-determined living at the age.
'What kind of living-form one chooses, however, is always an individual decision' she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement residence in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he can also get sick.
And: 'without a good knowledge of the national language together in the Dolce Vita,' the expert book author gives consideration to those willing to move.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative living forms or the often quoted pensioner WG.
At the age, everyone has his ticks and mucks
'For me, such a housing community would be nothing,' she said, 'with an eye-winner.
Not even as in a student toilet with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'At the age, you just need his retreat rooms,' said Ries.
The book author does not want to exclude the fact that a senior community can still work.
However, this would have to be done differently than in the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want his peace of mind,' she believes.
In this opinion, it is not alone in the state capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for as long', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the citizen service life at the age of the state capital.
Their service advises people on the topic of 'become older'.
For this reason, especially older people would often also buy inconvenientities and restrictions, only to be able to stay in their usual surroundings, that is also the experience of the Guertest Foundation.
There are many opportunities today to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends that all those who are engaged in the old-fashioned reconstruction of their home or their home should first be thoroughly informed and not commissioned by the first-best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for the conversion of age.
Even in the rental apartment, one or the other would realize this, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior architect will clarify.
But it is not always possible to transform the existing apartment age-oriented and therefore barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stairway within the apartment, which was also paved by stairs to the door of the apartment but would be the far bigger obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, it greys her more than before the spider at her door of the apartment.
USA wants to continue to persecute Snowden
The US has not changed its attitude to former U.S. intelligence employee Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of being disallowed to have passed on secret information.
So he had to face a criminal trial in the United States, said the US Foreign Minister, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The most recent statements by Snowden would not change it either.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbel's statements were about a parliamentarian rather than that of a German government member.
Secret service enveloper Edward Snowden is in principle ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the United States in a non-addressed letter published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele and forwarded to the Federal Government, Bundestag and General Confederation attorney.
The following text is replaced by the following after a translation by Ströbele:
To the persons responsible
I was asked to write to you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I used to be a contract or a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of law in my government, which prompted me to act on moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent hatred that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the USA and elsewhere.
Citizens all over the world and also high officials, including the United States, have judged disclosures to be a system of comprehensive surveillance that no one is accountable to the public.
These espionage envelopes drew many suggestions on new laws and directives aimed at the previously concealed abuse of public confidence.
The benefit to the company from these findings is becoming increasingly clear, while the risks acquired have been clearly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was evidenced to be positive, my government still treats this as a fidelity and seeks to criminalise and denounce political opinion.
Nevertheless, the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that, with the support of the international community, the United States Government will turn this down.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to participate adequately and legally in the responsible education of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and thank you for your efforts to preserve international law that protects all of us.
Edward Snowden witnesses by Hans-Christian Stroebele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality sold the former kindergarten in the garden street to a private person.
The municipal council agreed to the sale in its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "appropriate" price.
"The municipality is satisfied", says Maier.
In the budget, 100 000 euros were spent.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is entitled to hand over the responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and thus no longer needs to stand up for the entertainment of the house, how to heat, look for the garden and clear the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," says Maier.
Space concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann raises the clockstick at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Some 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The president Manuela Honeck presented the pieces of music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to cope successfully with the first musician hock.
Report: Obama campaign to replace Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have in secret considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, says the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is a copy of the next book and on Thursday evening, she reported that the president's top advisers would have conducted "full group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to find out if Obama's dwindling hope of re-election would be better if he would drop bids.
According to Jonathan Martin, national correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House, including the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the survey values of exchanging former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the narrowest advisers from the president, including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and former White House executive, David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew about the proposed change.
In 'Double Down' it is claimed that Daley had been at the forefront of efforts to exchange bids despite their 'near personal circumstances' before finally deciding against such a chess move after the data showed that the candidate Clinton's 'no significant improvement in the chances of Obama' would be.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I spoke a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley explained to the magazine.
One must recall that the president had terrible survey values at the time, so we thought: "For God's will, what are we doing?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as 'delivery', Martin told Anderson Cooper that during the campaign for re-election considerable effort had been made to find out if such a train paid off with regard to the electorate.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't think seriously about something," said Martin on AC360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley explained that he did not think that the president was aware of the possible change, the former Chief of Staff admitted that Obama had known it was possible.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not give a definite answer to the question whether the political exploratorys had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know anything about the investigations about letting bids fall in the elections.
"Possible", said Martin.
What happens to my e-mail on the go?
E-mail is actually called electronic letter.
Was the letter secrecy technically implemented in the design of the internet service similar to that of the conventional mail?
The main focus of the concept of early Internet services was to make communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not taken care to create a stable foundation for hearing-proof correspondence.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two connected directly?
Anna's e-mail or browser sends the e-mail to her service provider's mail server in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Are traditional e-mails read through the web on their way?
Most emails are read by software robots on the go.
At the provider of the sender, it is usually checked whether the mail leads to a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether this is a annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least sorted away in a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also detects the information Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail on their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display appropriate links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The probability that unauthorised persons read an email is extremely low.
But this is theoretically possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spouting actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be encrypted effectively against reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to cover up the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to recognise who communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
For the mainly privately used mailboxes, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role, according to an investigation by Convios Consulting from August 2013.
While Yahoo's share of mail had recently fallen, Google's GMail was able to make it clear.
Mother in the forest is shaved and pensioned
When his aged mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and still cashed their pension and care money.
In order to continue cashing pension and care money, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after investigating the police in the forest.
First of all, he covered up the death of the 89-year-olds, and then he took up the money for more than one and a half years.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as one speaker said on Friday.
Thus, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: at that time it was apparent that no more medication was needed for the mother in need of care.
The principal told the pensioner that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this was strange to the officials, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common home for more than 15 years and he had last maintained it.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother's death.
According to the police, an obduction did not reveal a capital break.
Do you like ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice shining in the dark – with the help of fever.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a glowing leakery.
The idea came to him, after he had read a research on torture and could convince Chinese scientists to produce the illuminating protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue, thus raising the pH in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and shines – the more one leaks, the lighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the "Lick Me I'm Delicious" ice cream company, says: "The product is incredible but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH and the ice shines.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever produced, because the liquefaction is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious for that.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to be made even more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is impossible on and for itself because of the light refraction caused by the ice crystals made up of ice cream; but I suppose we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a fever artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still in the handball league after six days of playing without any point.
Now, for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow, the Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts new for us.
"I hope we finally have our head free," Ehlers gives himself optimistic behavior.
In doing so, he finally has at his disposal his entire cadre, except for the permanently injured hendrik Blohme.
Daverden is also playing a tempo as well.
We therefore need to keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is important to increase in coverage, which has left everything but a secure impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season against Nordhorn.
Of course, the game was a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby everything can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to go to Morsum to start a series.
A lack of Jan-Malte Jodat.
The A-Jugendliche Joost Windßus, who is active with double-playing rights at the A-Jugend-Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates his seasonal debut.
If you're not hot in a game like this, stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween hug.
In the last two years I have not declared myself willing to distribute from my apartment out of sweets, and I will probably not do so this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep, about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I'm looking forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion US dollars, according to the NRF.
This year, irritant unanimated objects are the last scream.
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk spacemen will make it this year in Instagram feeds.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my amazement.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of hot dogs.
As far as sweets are concerned, we're not clumsy.
Americans will spend 1.9 billion dollars this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of chocolate gels, lumbers, bonbons and rubber tales.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Commerce 41 million people who move through the neighborhood with the saying 'Süßes or Saures'.
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we will not do anything – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the Candy Corn sugar sweet, but 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweeteners.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing more belongs to Halloween than houses where it spits.
They have great names such as 'Terror Behind the Walls' (which, by the way, is in a real prison), 'Howl-O-Scream' and 'The House of Shock'.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized locust houses in the United States that generate $500 million of proceeds, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pee into the pants and then put the friends on Facebook where you won't get rid of them again, and then one of the type you're standing on leaves a comment like 'net face'.
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the big pumpkin when we were children, and the carving of a pumpkin lattice is like the adornment of the Christmas tree – something we have made up of small ones.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us grew up working the pumpkin up and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lattice, which rots slowly in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested.
If you want to score properly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut something pretty out of their 921 kilos of pumpkin.
Apartment fire in Helmbrechts: Rescued mountains coaled bodies
The fire brigade had to reach Helmbrecht on the late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the Hof district catches fire at night to Friday.
The rescuers have a cold body out of the house.
Rescuers have found a cold body in a three-family house on a fire in Helmbrecht.
Whether it was about a resident is still unclear, as one of the police spokespersons in Bayreuth said.
On late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade, the flames hit from a window.
The forces went to the apartment and found the bodies in a room.
This and another room burned completely out.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesperson continued.
The building is no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest state church has started an offensive to recruit for the profession of the pastor.
Background is a possible parishioner lack: the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its now 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical press service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day process itself.
With Burfien, for the first time, the Landeskirche commissioned a pastor on a full job to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after Abitur.
Burfien refers this to the process of ecclesialization: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession was characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am Lord of my calendar and can focus on where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as a caregiver.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well with it.
Certainly more is being paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer.
These come to the young people of today who are not just about careers, but about a meaningful work.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, some 60 pastors are retired each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariate.
In thinly populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could be difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien wants to organise study days for young people, including students, and to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology studies offer a wide range of training.
You can even become Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as a free-lance system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from Bowler-Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racing drivers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as for a reachable way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare new ones for the straps and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge-Wagen – this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day at the Defender Challenge in February, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire brigade called to save a hat that was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock head in a quarries
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had run off after a small traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the quarries in her miserable location
Firemen sailed on rock wall and rescued the dog from safe death
The fire brigade managed to secure a small hat, which was stuck in a rock wall on a 15 meter high lead.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had run off after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a quarries on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 to whom the dog belongs, came to the Rockflapit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and to thank the fire fighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing bitch and had published help calls on social networks, when she had escaped the quarries after the small traffic accident.
About 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre-high heel in the quarries.
The Clekheaton Fire Station's technical rescue team hastened to the point and has been turned off to rescue Ruby, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from above and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff-frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then eaten some dog cakes.
That was a pretty unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a great luck."
It was possible that she was very severely injured or worse.
Ruby was sent to the veterinarian for examination, but it did not detect anything except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Seeing the rescue was frightening."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had grown too large and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The fire fighters have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid that she would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firemen were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains he never did Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she worked as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had eaten with the old rocker at night, and that "he had tossed me when I was 18.
She added: "It's been a long time and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever made attempts to approach Katy Perry."
The representative added: 'Maybe she has confused him with someone else.'
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling-Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed in early 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scottish the election
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport checks in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrianswall.
In fact, the Strathclyde proposal pointed out the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel to the rest of Europe, but this played no role in the headlines, as expected.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often comply with their strict rules when it is more favourable for them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance with Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scottish people.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has already come in the years that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I heard the "independence means pass control" ducks at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should one expect independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why the London yoke against that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan to unite Europe after the war has been put on hold.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
All over the EU, parties that are anti-EU or want to throw the euro over board as a Community currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the European Party of Alternatives for Germany – founded only this year – was able to win nearly five million votes in the Bundestag election in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, is a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the forced jacket in which the respective national economy is required by holding on to the single currency, many people believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments causing excessive budgetary deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members in exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and this would like to leave German politicians in this way.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe will find itself with an integrated productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only possibility is to reduce wages and public expenditure – inspired by Berlin.
The current budget and monetary problems are a major European problem of productivity.
As a result of the 'green' energy directives adopted by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays double for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
All wage fixeds in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolution rises, especially in France, the former EU cheerleader.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in danger and raise Paris on the eye with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has forced Europe into its own economic policy, with which the French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU-enemy Front National has just won a decisive election and thus referred the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with their newly gained popularity among the white French in the working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut off well in these elections – and that is very well possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point that I want to go beyond: in not all too future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together for the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the 'Europe of the (sovereign) nations' that General de Gaulle favours.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may stick to the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to dissociate from this project in the hope of flattering with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific area suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where's Scotland with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (lastly) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which also includes saying to Berlin and Brussels what they can find.
I suspect Scotland could be very well driven in a looser European union, provided that we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other, similar-thinking countries is easier in a non-fed Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider equalizing Norway and retaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, remarkably, the most successful political movement against savings policy in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and planned) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to answer.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to then get a saving policy from Berlin and Brussels.
Early Publishing: Growing up faster
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age friends, as studies show.
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty yet
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in young people
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specialises in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows at the age of seven or eight years breasts and hair of shame?
At the annual conference of the Children's Association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time calming parents down – it’s usually no sign that puberty is coming quickly,” said Kaplowitz.
Obviously showing development, such as growing breasts, shame and axle hair as well as body smell, show up at girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche (becoming the first regular bleeding) over the past 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
'When the breasts begin, it will take at least two to three years to the Menarche', said Kaplowitz, also author of the book 'early puberty with girls: the essential guide to dealing with this frequently occurring problem'.
Time is the most accurate test as puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually constitutes the beginning of puberty, but it is "early" when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth rate of eight years ago.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
Tests by an endicronologist may be indicated in a faster advance so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and the defense of another episode: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and therefore small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, development speed, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant about drugs, but he admits: "The oppression of puberty can ease behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their age partners."
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had been given her ten days.
Although there were first signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not prepared emotionally.
She came home scared and excited because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no clear evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be causal.
Boys come to puberty similar to girls earlier.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine years who created a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there were many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age partners.
There are different explanations for this.
Global seems to have influenced an early puberty of all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys are growing face and shame hair before, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as for girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and sham hair is even common in babies and infants.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician about how they should talk to their child.
"That could mean having to have a conversation earlier than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need insurance, which is a normal part of life, even if they enter earlier than thought.
Jumbo-producer disputes in the face of large orders over seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers it has come to an argument about the width of seats in the tourist class in long-haul flights, indicating the tone of a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered by passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who strive most for airlines, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims on the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co...
Airbus requested this week an industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the U.S. Archrivale Boeing says that airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builders are betating to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-distance aircraft and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – in particular if there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial for the indicated economic results to deliver the new “Mini Jumbo” design.
Boeing claims that its modernized 777X range of 406 persons in the tourist class seats, which are more than 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per series.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transported 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aeroplane giants often distribute hierbe via technical details by advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus appeals to the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new advertising war and showed sponsors an image in which three people are crammed into a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo props," says Airbus Sales Chief John Leahy.
In view of changed diet habits, people become thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the end of the century the weight of the male average American increased by 10 percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the data of the US Health Ministry.
The waist size of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says his rival was a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly baptized Jet Set was narrower.
According to Airbus, investigations have been carried out that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases the sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contests the numbers of Airbus on the seating dimensions and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between air fares and facilities.
The company also explains that according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
"It really is going on to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they feel they need to be successful," explains flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it becomes increasingly a topic that can affect sales.
The dispute is behind a race of aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices over the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-distance designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-sitting Boeing 77-300ER.
The Boeing statements on the results depend partly on the fact that the 777X is compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
Increased costs per unit are still lower than for currently used machines with 10 seats per row.
"Boeing is therefore taking more seats in his aircraft to make it more competitive with our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s point out that many passengers opted for the tighter arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper air fares.
"Actuary ten inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert in cabin facilities, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet vendors even wear tape size in themselves to measure the establishment in competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but according to its own statement no one has sold.
Until recently, Airbus has highlighted the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered for some jets wide seats at the corridors.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to be depleted, but could divert from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotin vaccine could make the garaus the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti nicotine vaccine that could ruin the fun of smoking.
One single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before testing human beings, further tests are needed, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and tried all the methods available on the market but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker to experience no nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice administered to nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
Mouses without vaccination, on the other hand, had taken a "time off", the researchers explained a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain the levels of antibodies that they were expensive and unpractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibodies.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be used for humans if he was sure to give children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
But it's more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
"They then know, when they start smoking again, they no longer feel a pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to put off the habit," he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was still necessary.
Tripodi disputed to have been influenced by obedia
An investigation is initiated against the former Minister of the Labor Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales.
The former NSW minister argues that at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, he has changed the rules on maternity leave which have hidden holdings in three land in state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigations on whether Obeid has influenced various state ministers in this respect, lease contracts at the Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without extending a tender after their expiry in August 2005.
Now, because of the accusation, Tripodi knew of Obeid's hidden interest in the plots, after Tripodi's earlier deputy staffwoman Lynne Ashpole had declared accordingly on Thursday.
In years of discussions that began in 2005, the government had called for public tendering for the lease agreements.
The owners were opposed and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the companies at the Circular Quay, which paid the Obeids 2.5 million dollars a year, were extended without public tendering.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Port from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken out for public tendering.
But he refused to have made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had called for the government’s lease arrangements to be reorganised.
One of the ICAC’s telephone offices showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had been converted to the Harbour Ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Was the topic discussed in these telephone calls the preparation of commercial leasing schemes?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," replied Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter aircraft attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli fighters attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed a senior government assistant to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said that it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year Israel has already carried out air strikes on rocket supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457-visa could be subjected to 'truth test'
The Government is thinking of a 'reality test' for foreign workers with 457 visas within the framework of extended measures.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used by means of a criterion to prevent the use of 457 for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as a back door for the migration of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a draft discussion was published by the government after the former members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments regarding foreign workers because they could be taken in insult by the neighbours of Australia.
"Laugh statements such as "foreigners are supposed to be in the rear" and "Australians first" are a very unpleasant setback in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically this was said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region were to link an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for a discussion covers 12 measures once initiated by former Minister of Migration Chris Bowen.
Minister of immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was here yesterday to discuss human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, others are still being considered.
If the "truth criterion" is taken over, someone applying for a visa could be checked in the light of whether "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or to a relevant person of the supporting undertaking or is personally connected."
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after hundreds of companies in the past who initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally stopped.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old sri-lanker asylumant probably died of a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on Christmas Island.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin since his father died on Wednesday who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study has been announced by the UK government to increase the benefits of the HS2 ice rink project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to establish high-speed connections between Scotland and northern England with the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project 'will bring the UK closer together'.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and northern England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British government, which talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to search for further track capacities and travel time improvements for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a three-hour or less journey from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are moving ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown Carmichael called on 'unmissible' for Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed railway link offers the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland provides an argument for fast rail links throughout the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to investigate options for a high-speed railway link in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish government already plans.
I am looking forward to examining the study report with the British Ministers next year and to taking the next steps together.
Electronic equipment requirements in aircraft remain in force temporarily in Australia
Australian passengers also need to continue to turn off tablets and smartphones at launch and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in flight mode.
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do this, but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when they start and land.
Australian companies observe the decision to ensure that US airlines have to do a lot of work to implement them, but do not follow direct plans to amend their rules.
The CARA Air Safety Authority also stated that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
"CASA does not currently have any specific rules on the use of electronic devices on the aircraft", was explained.
The subject is subject to provisions which require airlines to maintain safety at any time and to comply with the safety instructions provided by cabin crew.
Virgin has already conducted talks with the CASA about the use of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and explains that you are open to changes, but these had to be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas explained that the current regulations will remain until further notice.
"Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices should not be used at the start and landing and we currently have no plans to change that," the company said.
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and will certainly look at the FAA decision as well as the reasons behind it.
The decision has a different impact on US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs as well as customer instruction.
"After confirming the tolerance of its fleet, an airline can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases with poor visibility, the crew will show passengers to turn off the equipment while landing.
The group also recommended that more heavy equipment be stored safely under the seat or in the compartments over the seats at launch and landing.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke had accompanied BVB trailers with light rockets provided ugly scenes in the Veltins arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced hard consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Football League against the VfB Stuttgart, the ultras responded with a silence - initially.
It was an unusual, almost already spenstic acoustic that offered the viewer a signal Iduna Park until shortly before the start of the Bundesligaspiel between German vice-master Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart.
Most of the guests with their songs were heard.
On the other hand, the South Tribunes, where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented themselves exceptionally silently: No vocals, no battle calls.
The podest of the Capo, who otherwise coordinates the common combustion, remained unscathed.
And at the front of the tributary, a large flag with a labeled "Sion Stadium ban".
Only as a Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player entered the place, burned up short-term jubilation.
When his teammates followed, there were loud vocals and wailing scarves - but long ago not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribunes there was nothing wrong.
Also, that stadium speakers Norbert Dickel once again counted the positive experiences of the last days - Derby win, victory over Arsenal, contract extension by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not provide for celebration.
Only five minutes before the appetizer, the Capo climbed his pot - and the tension that had been gripped with hands just then escaped in a loud scream, when Dickel as usual asked the mood on the margins in the stadium.
The last one was as always the South Tribune in the series - and finally here again was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when, with a pavement from the South Tribune, the loud call "Derby is getting up" came again was everything as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before the tour of the FC Schalke 04, some of the accompanying BVB trailers had fired light rockets into the audience's arms and onto the square - and hit almost Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was played late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and one believes Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," the BVB-Boss announced on Thursday evening on a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I've banned it," he said.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will set a penalty by the end of the next week.
"That's going to be cutting," Watzke assured.
One may be excited about how the reactions to the Southern Tribune then fail.
Pfandhäuser boomen in Singapore, as the crisis arrived in the middle class
In a penthouse in the Bendemeer Shopping Centre in Singapore Janani Amirtreina exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, there's all my money in it," Amirtreuma says.
Although she earned 3,000 Singapore dollars each month (about 1.730 euros) as an administrative employee and her husband also worked, she did not spend the monthly family income, she explained.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so great that ValueMax, where she has exchanged, became the third Pfandhaus this week, which is listed on the Singaporean Stock Exchange.
The pledge of jewellery is not only a faster way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirtreusa – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, trustees in Singapore require an effective 17 percent annual interest rate, which is just above the 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, penitentiaries offer the advantage that no verification of creditworthiness or income evidence is required, which is why loans are faster than banks are possible.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to Pfandhäuser, after families feel pressure from rising cost of living and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a looser financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and medium incomes are looking for pan-houses to compensate for the difference in the case of stuttering economies.
This week the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, described as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the Agency, have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent still in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has just emerged from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continued decline in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the final effect this means that in view of rising costs, people in the middle to the lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highest gold prizes in the last two years have reinforced the trend towards the pledge of personal objects, as people take the opportunity to turn the family's jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items are gold in the 200 pedestals of the city state.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's promise grand mutter's gold chain and get back next month."
The largest Thai penthouse operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent increase in customer growth in recent months.
The growth in the pledge business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 more in Singapore, not only wants to expand into neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside of Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received this week with the exchange rate in Singapore.
While some creditors had gone to the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that penitentiaries not only offered more favourable interest rates than other lenders but also did not directly increase debt.
"Customers borrow items they already own, and the liquidating of personal assets does not increase household education," she explains.
The loan business is increasingly being accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use the loan are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the stores of ValueMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers come to us from every social layer.
"These include wealthy people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small companies who need to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need very fast money.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence service-discovery Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to clarify the ever-increasing NSA-spare.
Following the presentation of Hans-Christian Stroebele, Green-Bundestag member, at his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia, it was about the conditions under which ex-secret service staff would declare at a German prosecutor's office or before an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele said to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian Dollars for Tasmanian Health
The Australian government is based on the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth would take "unswerved measures" to prevent a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has cut down an emergency rescue package that, in our view, addresses the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The 325 million dollar package comprises 31 million dollars of emergency aid for election services.
Further 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments due to grey star, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there are money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better care after stationary stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas of the clinic workers who have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability obligation of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the 325 million dollars would be of little use if "they were not accompanied by real reforms that would lead the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course."
Regardless of this, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state's public health system from the state's worry list," said Wilkie.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely settle the recent cuts.
However, Peter Dutton, the public health spokesman for opposition at the federal level, believes that today's announcement is just a 'plaster solution'.
"We are therefore in a position today because the laboratory government has withdrawn 430 million dollars from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government takes almost half a billion dollars out of the system and inserts the Commonwealth 300 million and then pretends to be good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar of the rescue package would be spent for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also more expensive food than necessary.
The story of Suzanne, a young nobleman, in France of the 1760s, tells the moving story of Suzanne, sent to the monastery by her family.

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, such as a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and poison gas ammunition facilities, declared the global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group on Thursday, while in the north of the country there were serious clashes near one of the sites where toxic substances are thought to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed a short time ago since the beginning of the civil war.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date of
1 November, which the Hague-based organization of Damascus had set up to destroy all chemical weapons production facilities or to make 'inoperable', including all machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which basically represents the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious schedule aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons of Syria by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, still has to begin to destroy existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in Safira City on Thursday, the experts saying there was a chemical weapons production facility and warehouses here, as reported by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, which was based in the UK.
The activist group, which followed the number of dead through a network of activists in Syria, stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18.678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead, 2,202 are army soldiers, and 5,375 fighters of opposition, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 to be 100,000.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of which have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The Observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fights underline the danger posed by chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syria from its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a deadly civil war.
According to the OPCW, which cooperates closely with the United Nations, the team "is now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has lived with its destruction."
Therefore, 'no further inspection activities are currently planned'.
At the beginning of the week the inspectors had explained that they had completed the first round of reviews and had visited 21 of 23 of the sites declared by Damascus.
Because of security concerns, the inspectors said that the visit of two facilities was not possible.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that, according to the Syrian statement, the two sites had been "tapped up ... and the existing objects of the chemical weapon program had been moved to other sites that were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I take the hat in front of the bravery and the courage that you have all shown when you complete the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Surveillance Organisation in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad's government and its security forces, which are part of many Alawites, are dividing Shiite Islam.
Regarding further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is not known, he explained.
Anger of Judgment for Bombers of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had died at the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted annoyed by the judgment of the last of the instigators who had been brought to trial, as Umar Patek felt that they should be shot in a civil manner.
Patek, who was on the run for nearly ten years as one of the most sought-after people of Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to a 20-year imprisonment for his role in the construction of explosives for the bomb attack.
He could be released after 15 years of imprisonment.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
An indictment was also made in a number of terrorist charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Holy evening in 2000.
The prosecutor's office had demanded a lifelong prison sentence, even if it was for the man who, because of his reputation as a masterly bomb builder, was also called a "Demolition Man" who could have applied for death penalty.
The decision aroused painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a shooting command," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I won't have another grandson and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was made equal to the ground, when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23 o'clock a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide killer had an explosive-filled backpack exploded.
He fell into the coma for a month after the attack and died three times while hanging on a life-saving system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the blood bath and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before everyone else.
To let Him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and hurt many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers in court.
He removed almost a decade of arrest, but was finally captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed the former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden nearly four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden with the aim of re-establishing the connection between South East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't stand up," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has not shown any regret for how much suffering he has caused other people.
The verdict was given before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which was held with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not carry out mobile calls)
Travelers can now hear their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and using the reputation of movies from departure to landing, but not by phone, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they were implemented, depending on the airline, FAA staff member Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Airlines shall demonstrate to FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight personnel training manuals and the rules for the staging of the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines that would like to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Passengers currently need to switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They can only start them again after the plane has reached an altitude of three kilometers and the captain gives green light.
When entering the landing flight, passengers must switch them off and not start them again before the plane has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft were secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at launch, landing and rolling field, the FAA stated.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft that have been refitted to larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria.
Laura Glaad, President of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline – both sides will benefit from it," said Gladen.
In fact, we are sorry to have to feel like binoculars on this subject.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data below three kilometres were still prohibited, explained the Authority.
Passengers are invited to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Srabble-like online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet by American Airlines in effect because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the flight platform.
And heavier devices such as laptops also need to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile calls during flight also remain prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may prohibit certain electronic equipment when started and landed
Last month Mark Rosenker from the Transport Safety Authority said National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national traffic issues on CBS News, mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
"Handy is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential disturbances in navigational devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmission masts," says Rosenker.
A consulting committee in the sector, set up by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on FAA has increased to loosen restrictions on use.
Critics such as the democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri consider that there are no valid safety grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become omnipresent.
In some studies it is said that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the shutdown of the device.
The FAA started in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers after reports of interferences of navigational and communication equipment had become known through passenger-led VHF radios, which were the latest technology.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not make any electronic interferences.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the altitude is reached.
The planes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic devices according to the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally produce much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-reader, for example, only gives off minimal radiation when you turn around.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the defenders of a relaxation of the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers.
In 2011, employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E readers and made a test flight to detect problems but could not detect.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to the risk of equipment use.
Douglas Kidd of the passenger association National Association of Airline Passieres said he felt that the interference by the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only individual reports of pilots talking about the fault of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them were very old.
The Committee recommended, however, that the FAA allow pilots to arrange for the switch-off of the equipment by passengers when landing instruments under poor visibility.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who are today fully equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Released by air rescue service of North Sea Bohr Island saved bird
A bird flying by air rescue service to the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea Bohr Island, was released back into nature.
The water rallies were flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where they were padded by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPA in their rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, Head of the Centre, said: "This water shelf was probably a winter train bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the bore island.
He added: "He couldn't continue flying, so we were contacted with the request for help."
When released, the water rallies were fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide for prosperity and work in the UK want to change to our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 executives from the economy who represent the British business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow while the states in the EU stagnate.
They hope that new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil will be favoured by the government side, rather than with the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscene EU institutions.
The majority of economic leaders consider that control over these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, as according to the companies, the cost of Brussels regulations would now exceed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the one that is traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and this probably says most, our survey of economic leaders showed that a significant majority of the UK wishes a course towards change of the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This awareness of companies of all sizes and leading corporations shows that the economy is pushing for a "sensual change" which brings action back to Great Britain.
It is a matter of a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: This survey shows that the UK economy is behind its plan for the renegotiation of British terms for membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power from a renegotiation to the UK.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which gives companies greater attention to trade and fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era
The construction of the South Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects, said the Gazprom Executive Board.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Street gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said Gazprom's CEO Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, ensures an increased risk for conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "for ever" eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream to discounted tariffs when the whole project is in operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction works in other subordinate countries should begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, no way leads past the real estate location of Germany.
The economic frameworks are in line, and the funding opportunities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th day of the real estate of the stock exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country in comparison to Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa, noted this on the 9th day of the stock exchange news.
According to Ulbrich, according to Ulbrich, as requested by German commercial real estates.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the same period of the previous year.
In the UK the increase was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Immobilieninvestments offer an attractive interest rate," Ulbrich said.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexual offences related to children before 2011 accusations were raised against the child caregiver Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children experienced.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that 'in the organization, there was never any sexual abuse in the event of sexual abuse'.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case where an YMCA employee had been accused of crimes with child pornography and another one where a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 had been sentenced to him for the abuse of trusted children.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission’s assisting lawyers, that he knew of the first case, but had not known the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission had also been inaccurate in the claim that 'it had given external reviews of YMCA, in which YMCA was recognised as being at the forefront of child safety.'
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second-lowest evaluation of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started at YMCA at 21, admitted that the board of directors had failed "from me down" at Lord's attitude and did not ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety guidelines.
Lord was sentenced to YMCA at the beginning of the year for sexual abuse of twelve boys during his two-year career.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare disagrees, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that staff had held out reporting Lord's infringements regarding the safety of children.
The employees said they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, cared for them privately as a babysitter, had them sitting on his lap, told one that he loved it, and had children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for training for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child minister Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord's superior in the YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and was most of the time very unnecessary.”
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept statements from employees, according to which they would not have dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, her friendship with Lord affected her judgment, which is why they had not reported him.
Hare explained that he had informed the Board of Directors of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organisation had to draw from the "Jonathan-Lord interval" was "not reporting" by employees, and the board agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to force the employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations were made has been made by the managing director of the child services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was necessary to prevent contamination of the evidence, but what had been 'overly' and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization between 2009 and 2011, when Jonathan Lord was employed there, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual child abuse, told the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in the recruitment, review, processing, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would use the chance to return as a British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various internal policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments mostly limited to foreign policy and its role as ambassador of the quartet of peacemakers in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the office of the Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London with the words: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
When the horse-show experts found themselves in pairs in Cardiff to shorten the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten and who only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee walked loosely through the three laps and got the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable pair, both of them of the same size, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate cap in a terrible angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony that lie far above his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then practiced with the Shetland ponie every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire participant field and went from the place with gold pokal and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena thought him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howell, who has been presenting horses for over ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was like electrified and everyone fired him and clapped him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of.
As he started, it won't take long until he's on the "pferd of the year" show – and I'm sure he'll cut off well.
One speaker from the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
They're a great team together.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee how well they would have beaten themselves and presented it in the presentation ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Fenton and Toffee – and there were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes contributed her part to it, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be 'reformed' after call
A Chinese newspaper, on the front page, who had demanded the release of a reporter who had been accused of diffamation, was to be reformed, declared a press regulator.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou, had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribery to fake reports about a state-owned company.
Now the new expression is being subjected to a 'wide revision', the regulatory authority stated.
The "Rectification Order" was issued by the Office for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inappropriate reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that it had been decided to "put up an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter's license."
In addition, "Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to make a full revision of the New Express and to recommend that relevant stakeholders be identified at the New Express and to immediately review the New Express's management team."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared in state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment.
"In this case, I damaged Zoomlion as well as the whole news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he explained to the state news channel CCTV.
I did it first of all because I was out of money and fame.
I realized that I was doing wrong.
Following Chen's apologies, the New Express published an apologies on the title page and explained that it was not possible to review the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently filed TV confessions.
Experts say that confessions are still being forced routinely, despite a legislative amendment at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse himself.
Drug tunnel with its own railway between the USA and Mexico discovered
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120 x 90 cm measuring tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they have ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless inconceivable warehouses, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could not be transported in it, the authorities explained.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were ensured, according to the records of the court.
Three men, who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were charged with the possession and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They threaten to face imprisonments between 10 years of age and for life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of dehydration channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartel with the challenge of quickly bringing their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre-long passage with rails, which ran from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love themselves
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate paths in future.
In an interview he said, however, that both he and Kerr still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has expressed himself in order to separate himself from his wife, Topmodel Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "life sometimes does not go exactly as we plan or hope for it".
Kerr and he himself still loved himself, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, her son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to Lexika, Vegetarianism is subject to vegetarianism, but it is quite different from that in a very significant way.
For while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream biscuits, ice cream or a strong edamer, these slugs are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the absence of meat and fish, the vegan leaves off from all consumption of animal products - honey is also not used.
What remains, one may wonder, but with closer consideration, the vegetarian food world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Brother prints are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealander has been living vegan, in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "1997 I converted my diet and became vegetarian."
Around the turn of the century, the next step took place and I became Veganer.
"But the conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers normal leather leather.
He recognized that there are other everyday concerns without animal products.
First of all, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor states the Maxime of the Vegans, which extends to the entire consumer behaviour.
Instead of grieving after the burrows, stirs or rubber bears, the Venetians quickly discovered completely new products, and the enthusiasm rose.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan does not represent his absence, no ascetics, but it's an enrichment." The assumption that you reduce the choice of food options with the change of diet is more likely to lead Proctor back to the power of habit.
And precisely these conditions made some still so well-intentioned attempts fail.
"The search factor is a crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And turn on: "Some tastes are not to be fixed on the animal".
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," the vegan explains.
For example, Proctor brings a barbecue party, aubergines, mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages.
It pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it is supposed to taste well.
Of course you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but that's not just to reduce it to animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he has not suffered.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes that feed exclusively vegan.
"My blood values are good, I'm often checked," Proctor reveals.
In particular, many Vegansimus critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed with feed instead of grassing on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat that is bought in the cold rest, the vitamin B12 content is high," Proctor finds.
For vegans, there is also the possibility of taking the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
There was no need to go far-reaching pro-ctors for food procurement.
After all, there is basic food everywhere, and every supermarket has soy milk and other products.
I'll find everything I need on site.
Only every once in a while I buy something special.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but that's how "normal" finished products are known to be".
Nevertheless, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than generally accepted.
"There's a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small sniffs you can get good, if not some better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, slightly more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cake, Proctor was also able to make his parents-in-law wonder.
Family festivals give the vegan a new sausage.
This is dynamic when you cook together, it has a new priority.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
But, of course, skepticism has already been brought to him.
You don't taste my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in the case of such questions, you have to act as a vegan with a fingertips feeling.
"I do not reject the people, I am part of this society", Proctor does not want to be enclaved.
And more precisely, the everyday world doesn't seem as vegetarian as suspected - and the vegan doesn't seem as restricted in everyday life as generally assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
"Many dönerladen offer falafel, or just a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria it deviates to pasta dishes, or just order a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow to adjust to it.
"When I started feeding vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealander can find out a development: "You have to talk to the people to draw attention to it."
"If enough requests come, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, for example, the lounges in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Actually, vegan dishes are available for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"In contrast, meat dishes are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor says.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, Veganism is a sure way to make most of it impossible from the beginning," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning.
In particular, if you learn to understand that animal additives may be included in peanuts as colouring agents, you seem to quickly leave the courage with the observance of ethics in so many obstacles and traps.
Not only did Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen write a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and Their Alternatives" explain the many ingredients that are added to food as well as cleaning products.
"After and after you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to "It's sometimes better to do small steps than stand or stumble," Proctor knows.
Veganism, he's an important moral fingertip that beats the consciousness.
Maybe he doesn't quite manage to put his habits down, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers breathing.
Trade on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger pans with the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday the indices of the Nasdaq were not calculated for an hour because of errors in data transport.
In August of this year there had been two pans alone in one week.
First, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively faulty sales orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
The stock exchange operators then needed almost an entire day to look through and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trade in the US came to light for several hours because of a computer pan at the Nasdaq stock exchange.
Moreover, the Facebook stock exchange course had been a highlight last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sales orders, later established the SEC stock market supervision and thinned the company to a record penalty of 10 million dollars.
Konstanz: Radler drives 63-year-olds around
The accident was reported by the police when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, at 2 p.m., was on the left way from the station to the marketplace with a female bicycle.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man stepped out of a local walkway, according to the police, the cyclist could no longer brake in time.
During the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went further to the floor and drew a square wound of about 15 centimetres long on the head.
A rescue car team brought the injured to the hospital for medical treatment.
British Police will send Assange an extradition notice
The British police today handed over an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard said that the 40-year-old Australian had sent him a "call to stand up" which asked him to appear in a police station and added that he should not comply with that, threatened him with arrest.
Assange threatens to deliver to Sweden because of the charges in a sexual offence, after his possibilities for British law have been exhausted, since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to extradition at the beginning of the month.
As he fears that Stockholm would deliver him to the US, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard sent 'a 40-year-old man to make a call at a police station at a time we have chosen', said one speaker.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on deposit.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange fears that he was delivered to the United States from Sweden and accused of possible spying accusations after he had published more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks's disclosure website.
Driver, who was caught with 210 km/h and hot drink between the legs, receives 1,000 pounds of punishment
A car driver was imposed a fine of £1,000 because he had driven up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on 27 May with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
In front of the Colchester District Court, Howie was guilty without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay £90 and a £100 victim surcharge.
Tax for foreign property owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of treasurer George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget imposed a stamp tax of 7% on apartments that cost over two million pounds, as well as annual charges for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
The revenue from the stamping tax for residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which amounted to 708 million pounds in 2012/13, has already been collected for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: "After the increases in stamping tax on high-priced apartments and the introduction of the related legislation against dealing with them, it is difficult to claim that high-quality real estate is too low taxed, regardless of the impact of the obsolete municipal tax system."
"But this step could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy or sell real estate in London," he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London south-west belt extending from Fulham to Wimbledon, the record value of 11.8 % last year has increased.
Prices in Central London showed an annual growth rate of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging domestic market where the south-western part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to an investigation by Savilles.
Scientists could shed more light on the context of a dog's tailing with his mood.
Previous research had shown that lucky dogs with the tail were turning more to the right (from the sight of the dog), while it was the left side of nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "The human being is well aware that the left and right brain half reacts differently to stimuli causing positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs as well as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tailing of their fellows, the researchers monitored the animals while these films looked at other dogs.
They measure the heart rate of the four-legged bones and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves in one, sometimes in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed dogs movies with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate divergent other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw an otherwise expressless dog moving the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wedding dog), they remained completely relaxed.
However, the tail inclination was mainly left (again from the perspective of the dog, who grazes), so her heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and the wedding is linked with the tail in one direction rather with friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you respond on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could help to better understand the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behavior and guest scholarship at the University of Bristol Department of Animal Medicine, stated that this was not the first study to investigate whether dogs were important to the left and right.
Last year, a team of the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it comes to a satisfied dog.
In another research work at Victoria University in Canada, the following was said: “Does go to a robot dog, if his “swant” turns left, and not to the right, rather than to get restless – exactly the other way around than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore affect that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"While there are considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain half are used for different purposes, many of the details still have to be determined – and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
However, since their behavior was easy to record, it probably won't take long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves into one, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys shift appearance in Glasgow due to the disease Alex Turners
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has moved a performance in Glasgow after her lead singer has been ill with throat-head inflammation.
The band from Sheffield should play in the hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be relocated.
The band's announcement came after she had had to move an appearance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys announced: "After deciding to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and at the medical council, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.."
"At Alex Turner, an inflammation of the throat was diagnosed, which is why, unfortunately, he cannot occur."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, which was transferred to the Hydro in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconveniences caused by this.
Please contact the customer service department at the point where you bought your ticket, if you need further support.
Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis would for the first time appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church according to the Pope and they are also the ones who elect a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a Cardinal who has reached 80 years of age can no longer participate in the Pope's election – this is due to a group of 120 'electorial cardinals'.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesperson of the Vatican, said there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony is held for the appointment of the new cardinals, known as the Consistorium.
"Papst Franziskus has decided to announce his decision to consist in February in advance so that other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elected cardinals would probably have fallen until February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of elected cardinals again amounts to 120, and as many cardinals as he wants.
The Council next year is therefore important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, says Valero.
At present there is a certain overhang on Europe's side, and in particular Italy's.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything by himself.
"Now Franziskus has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He stated that it was "goodly possible" that Francis asked the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position – this is all completely new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically be called to cardinals from large places, but Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he names”.
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the US to repair the seatrest
General Motors called back almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks with built year 2014 to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seatrest, according to a communication from the US vehicle safety regulator on Friday.
In some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seatrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal directives on vehicle safety in head restraints.
"If the vehicle is driven from the rear to the rear, it is possible that the headrest does not properly protect the inmates so that there is an increased risk of injury," said the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recovered models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and is the most important model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA could not verify the notification letter because of the 16-day government Shutdowns, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, stated GM on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share rose by 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperation cry of an Obama dialer
I have elected President Obama twice in hopes that change is possible
He says Obama has made praiseworthy efforts that have been tainted by the Republican blockadectics
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad memory of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terrible sad book.
It's a book I believed it would open me up during my dubious second year of medical studies and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (Mut to Win) and describes the memories of Barack Obama as the 2008 presidential election.
When I'm done with my patient records and go to bed in the evening, the book takes me back to a time when politics was able to breathe millions of inspired and a speech.
The election became a victory of landslides and news speakers kept in mind the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had 82% approval.
And then I'll close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening as if you were torn out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed possibilities.
In the years since I first gave my voice, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and versatile things Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I too believe that party-political blockadectics have turned too many efforts to push our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and closing Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.
But after defending the Obama government countless times to colleagues and acquaintances, I ended up trying to explain myself.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is allowed to listen to foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why Whistleblower is punished, which discloses state wrong behavior.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without a trial, and why the public funding and spending limits during the presidential elections will be avoided.
It does not justify the results of a report in which the White House's efforts to preserve the media have been the 'most aggressive ... since the Nixon government'.
And recently it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in which more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood with 18 that the government work could contradict the political campaigns before it.
Obviously, the Parliamentary Office is not a predictable course, as a opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown Massacre shape the public debate.
But if I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and inexhaustible alternative that he seemed unable to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope of which we had heard for so long.
But with the sinking of Obama's approval values to under 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become much harder.
It wakes up in me the longing for the many promises that have been dissolved in air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes Obama's need to infect a severe loss against Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election assistants after the decision, he told his employees that they had to come back to the course and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I can't agree to you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest during parental leave
Mr Clive Palmer, billionaire and Member of Parliament, said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his parental leave plans because his daughters were pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, in a court dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 tax, raised the claim when he wanted to wipe out questions from the table whether he was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether the CO2 and mining taxes will be removed or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets a vacation or not," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, Palmer’s election commission officially declared the winner of Fairfax’s Sunshine Coast seat with 53 votes.
Palmer called for a revision of the voting-counting process so that it could take place faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system where you cross in that data into a computer, select it immediately and then get the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the voting lists.
Are you using them because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
To vote with pencils today is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic elections and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy was to hold an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously".
A public office is concerned with public service.
"We do not seek any reward except for history, namely that we can serve in a critical time for this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange department, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global public investigation of the alleged manipulations on the currency market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the investigation in the world's largest financial market, on which 5.3 billion US dollars change the owner daily.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the extensive investigation that the scandal draws on the libor interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that they had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this subject continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, close persons reported that the RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and from a previous dealer to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and is now to have been admitted from his current position as European Director of Forex-Spot Trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was left this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these dealers were accused of any misbehavior.
Bankers belonged to the Instant Message Group of Usher at Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation.
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees, after the Swiss regulatory authority had declared Finma that she was looking for an alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with accusations that bankers should have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said familiar persons with the situation.
Banks collect instant messages and e-mails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has upset the traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading dealer noted that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks led to the fact that "they can influence the market with very low ticket prices".
The message came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she had announced this week to a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds office after he caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank informed the competent authorities promptly and cooperated with them.
"We are sure that the dealer acted alone and that the matter has been blocked," Credit Suisse explained.
Painted the construction fence on the Bechtle site
A group of citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has beautified the Bauzaun on the Bechtle site at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
Furthermore, she cleaned up and spread the footpath, says it in a press release.
The planned coverage of the disintegrating house in the rear part of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, as the terrain is threatening to slip off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed with his colleague Reinhard Domke by the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparency with the message "We are for this" had been put in place.
However, this did not interfere with the action of some 20 members of the citizens' initiative.
Her motto on the large poster was "We are against ruins".
She wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should fail one day.
In conversation with many passers-bys in front of the "building site" it became clear that some citizens believe that with the implementation of the project of the city it will go much better, although few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they start to resign, because the city continues to delay these answers, says it on the side of the BI.
As was to be heard, the mayor's public statements also have an effect.
In May, at the municipal council meeting, he had said that he was afraid of the thermal bath, the public should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some seem to be just too scared, others feel that they are a "plump extortion attempt" to the population, says the BI press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick-Schielte für Schiris: Mane nicht SchwalbenKönig
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is also satisfied with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the " Bulls" was disappointed by the arbitrators.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category Schwalbenkönige," he took the two offensive weavers in protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
Last occasion for Rangnick's critique was yellow for Mane at 3:0 last Sunday, when Senegalese became an alleged acquittal - who was not, of course, as the TV pictures showed.
"A severe misconception," said Rangnick, who described the arbitrator Harkam as "fully overwhelmed."
Harkam also contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the match.
He defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same way in every situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleague after the scramble with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who was offended," the 46-year-old stressed.
However, due to the success, Rangnick voted in favour of a praise.
"For this there are only two words: right good," he noted.
There's not much to suspend.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on like this.
There will hardly be any changes in the winter transfer time.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Outside a player comes up with the wish he wants to leave the club," Rangnick made clear.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama government: The U.S. Supreme Court today decided that the health law associated closely with Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US citizens to conclude a health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the framework of the State tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts struck on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-side law and also considered that the requirement of the Health Act, according to which states would either have to extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise delete all state Medicaid funding, was not restrictive.
The appeal against the law was imposed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challengeer Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place makes light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low level of sunfall, the Rjukan located in the Vestfjord Valley usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three giant reflectors at 45 meters altitude, a century's dream became true on Wednesday.
"Endly!", mayor Steinar Bergsland swam at the launch ceremony in TV2.
Some villagers put up sun chairs, others set up sunglasses for safety.
So far, in winter, sunshine had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
This basic idea, however, has been in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about 615 000 euros) of expensive project.
A similar construction has given winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine town of Viganella for a number of years.
Post is hardly empty on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red points for the Sunday emptying are still located at various mailboxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small printed on the yellow containers of Post AG, you can quickly find that the emptying on Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed that.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the post building on Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and on the Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttefeld will be emptied.
Whether it is still being emptied Sunday in Hofheim and Rosengarten, the answer to the FDP's request will not be answered.
The social and youth spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to rehearse here.
The Sunday emptying is an important postal service at appointment.
"This company reduces radical and unreasonable despite the price increase for letters on January 2013."
Thomas Bittner, President of the Liberals' political groups and town associations, supports his group colleagues: "What troubles me is the fact that here the periods of emptiness are changed or also deleted".
From close to the citizens, the post is miles away.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be emptied again Sundays," says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also for the core city, especially not mobile citizens, a letter box with Sunday emptying would have to be able to reach in future.
In the city parliament, Röhrenbeck asked whether the city administration was planning discussions with the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
But his knowledge is also a Sunday empty in Hofheim.
Her party has spoken out for privatisations.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurt parking fees should rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
The Magistrate of the City advises this morning about a presentation of the Transport Department Stefan Majer (Green).
Hence, parking charges should be increased by 50 percent.
However, it is not intended to increase prices but to shorten the time interval of parking watches and car parking machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Ordinary Assembly will have to decide.
The retail committee of IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea".
The parking possibility immediately before the store is "an unreserved advantage for smaller retailers".
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland believes that an increase after two decades is "suitable and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick action rumble host
In the Schiller Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen, Mr. I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to attack the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbische Alb with a narrow cadre.
The Älblers were on the other side of the network with an experienced team.
Soon , however , it became apparent that , even under age , they were not able to compete fully with the quick actions of the city of joy .
With the hard and placed ups the Gönninger were extremely difficult.
Repeatedly, they missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz over the network centre and were not in the position of the block defense.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the city of joy in all matters.
In view of this oppressive and playful performance, the third movement was won a bit lascivious and pointless at the end of the 3:0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd, a much more powerful opponent will be standing on the field with the TV Baiersbronn, who was able to apply clearly in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were in front of the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard battled two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused faults and point gifts, especially when ballads were taken; even at the passes the precision was sometimes a lack of material and in some critical play scenes the overeligor prevented the look for possible point gains.
In this very balanced meeting, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto voted through the great physical commitment and a happy commitment of both teams.
Maintenance day at the small English hut
For the fifth day of care following the Natura 2000 project of upper Hotzenwald, a group of committed participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, this day in the area of the hut the view should be cut to the valley, Mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the sparkle of the canyon, on which the landscape offered the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
He offers every citizen the opportunity to place accents in nature.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, the ecological aspect could also be taken into account.
Friederike Tribukait explained this ecological aspect of the Nature Conservation Department of the Freiburg Government Presidency following the welcome of the Tilman Bollacher Landrat, who had taken over the Principality and wanted the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the wide view is to preserve the ever-growing old Allmendweide field with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
You need these free links to keep your art.
Tribukait said they don't want to miss out on this spot to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
In this planning, the current measure is not only seamless.
A biosphere area also offers the chance of sustainable economic and environmental development based on internationally recognised unesco status and thus a continuous addition of those achieved with the life project as well as the previous maintenance days for the future.
After these various presentations, the director Christoph Wehle and the life project manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, the forschlepper could be called up.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper trunks and care for a dry stone bar.
The goal was the free view at the vantage point.
Löffingen: Köpfler is still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baartädtchen Löffingen can be referred to as an attractive city with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a trendsetting school, children's, youth and seniors policy, as well as its own urban works, no second mayor has yet reported.
As the only candidate for the succession of mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for the age, has so far been the 46-year-old banker and business owner Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application deadline will expire on Monday 11 November at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which has thousands of previous Nortel patents, imposed on Thursday an avalanche of complaints for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was banned by Nortel in the insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is sued in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents involved technology that brings search terms into line with relevant advertising on the Internet, according to the action that meets the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid over 900 million dollars for Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $4.4 billion.
After it was handed over to the Nortel patents of Rockstar, Google Motorola acquires mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library to patents.
"Although Google failed to acquire the patent at the auction with his attempt to acquire the patent, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," says the file.
Rockstar calls for a high compensation from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, so the accusation.
Egypt Approves First Freely Selected President
Muhammad Mursi makes the official oath, but his day of triumph is not supposed to mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Muhammad Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he was apologised as the first freely elected president of the country and thus succeeded Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With its introduction to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He placed the oath before the 18 black robed judges of the court, who had their seat on the Nile and who had received an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi at the solemn ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group who, since its founding 84 years ago, had been severely taken into the eye by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o'clock local time.
Only a few hundred adherents had gathered before the court to welcome the new president, and unlike the presidial prunk from Mubarak time, traffic was stopped only short-term, so that the auto convoy could cross the usually lively road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic 'replaced wheel' of brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists but all of those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the uprising of 2011 against authoritarian Mubarak to the finish.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie to the judges in the wooden chamber in which he placed the official oath.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his opening speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem he heard in custody.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
When he arrived, he was welcomed by hundreds of people in the University's largest hearing hall with speaking voices of "The Army and the people are one hand".
The University of Cairo, which was established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has developed into a high castle of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi made a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising, which led to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he praised to reclaim presidial powers that the military council had taken over by the head of state hunted out of office.
But with the removal of the official oath before the court, and not as usual before Parliament, he bows to the military's will, indicating that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursis speech on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
Today's Friday evening, "Pump this party" will be called "Pump this party", on tomorrow's Saturday night it will continue with a Ü 25-party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers of course on both days.
Workers crashed from ladder: badly injured
A 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder when he replaced a broken outside sensor on Thursday.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heater on the exterior facade of a guest house.
As he ascended to the ladder attached to the roofing pit, this way went and the man fell onto the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought to Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christoorus 6".
Rapist in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice life on Friday.
This was reported by the station SABC.
The victim died later on the consequences of the serious injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty of crime at the beginning of the week.
The act had caused horror throughout the country.
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought for 14 hours to survive the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so horrific that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Cana had admitted during the process of being with Booysen on the Tatnacht in a bar.
He also understood that he had beaten and raped them, but he fought to be responsible for the death of the girl.
The police had initially gone out of custody of several perpetrators, but they dismissed two suspects because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The prosecutor's office also stressed during the proceedings that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape in South Africa is almost everyday: there are some 64 000 ads every year because of sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people significantly more people than South Africa (50 million).
However, police and women's associations in South Africa value the dark point of sexual violence at 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo looking for the "best ham in the world": For the TV broadcast "Galileo" the Pro7 star Bonndorf visited.
Right at the beginning, the speaker makes clear: the most important thing for the ham is the pigs, turbomast is not a good condition.
Could ham, which you get in any supermarket, be a quality product?
As the head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the functioning of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham," as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and kittel he comes into the inside of the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands for the first time before he is allowed to use the micro.
Searched Jumbo for strengthening fast food in Waldshut
"I'm working here in huge quantities," the TV-maker, Black Forest ham as a mass product, marvels at.
16,000 Cologne per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what quality matters.
Most pigs are slaughtered with six months.
Television with a level?
Details such as the Ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
"That's where I'm excited when you know Roberto Blanco, what happens then," says Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But looking at it is still worth it.
The viewer sees that disseminating the Cologne is still handiwork.
Because: Black forests ham is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of ham is the seasoning mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire, Jumbo optically reminds of a "U-boat".
The trick: Tanning branches provide the special taste of the Black Forest ham here in smoke.
20 days in smoke finally make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in Jumbo," he announces the test-food.
"It's really delicious," says the conclusion of the TV star.
This will enable all stakeholders to live.
You thought travel agencies were part of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the year as a whole and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects a adjusted annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared with 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
When the current target values are reached, this means growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and recorded a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Our ten countries have been profitable since the beginning of the year and some of them are well in the direction of record year revenues before interest and taxes," he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which typically belong to our strongest beneficiaries.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, making it a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it went well for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while even here the business customers were spending less.
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so that a profit for the year as a whole is expected for the third year in a row.
Flight Centre's shares rose by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools are held to a greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In the course of English literature, students will have to treat at least a piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onward.
The examination also contains 'unseen texts' to encourage the wider reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015, students will have to take a separate GCSE test for language, with strong incentives for choosing English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will tomorrow publish the new curriculums for English and Mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core compartments will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit supervisory authority, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new quotation system and less course work.
In a summer speech, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is "a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would become "requisitive, ambitious and stricter".
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
On average, Australian schools teach 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the schedule, it is said from coalition circles that the comprehensive math testing – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in rankings – is likely to encourage schools to start more hours.
In the curriculum, more attention is paid to "problems from the right life", including financial mathematics.
Delicate animals and delicious cakes
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and color sets presents the circular association performance show this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
The evaluations have already been made on Thursday

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Conference Forum
At the next Ecumenical Conference Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the New Museum of the Castle it is about the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological reflections about today's handling of the last things".
Speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Conference Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant churches Salem, Salem Castle and Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to go into the forum of the question, because today people are taking the "last things" after death.
If people in the past centuries had known too much about it and had placed it on those images of heaven and hell, "who still shape our ideas," the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of perfection is more reflected by a certain embarrassment or even languagelessness.
"The greater hope has been properly driven out of Christians by religious criticism," says the speaker.
She "supplied us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation signs."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the trouble of death".
In this connection, the question of that longing is "thinking that everything may be good at the end".
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her Ph.D. in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The habilitation of fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at Wilhelms University in Westfäl.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has been a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Little Heuberg reaffirm their creed for faith in the confirmation of the confirmation of faith
In two divine services 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the Soul Care Unit At the Kleine Heuberg have been promoted.
In the morning, the Laudato-Si group accompanied the divine service, in the afternoon of the Youth Choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Firm Sacrament, the young people said Yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, the firmers had prepared themselves under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of many members of the community for the big feast.
In various projects they learned various tasks of Christian community life and shared the youth day in Untermaftal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race fascinates participants
In the case of beautiful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to take the round course over the hill ranges around the lake.
This will inform Ulrich Knobel of the organizing sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 metres of altitude, were also numerous people's cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in competition atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aachen-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German Championships.
These two were able to sit down from the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time gap to his goal and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
==References====External links==
In the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare, which made it up on the top of the winning strike.
Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen on 2nd and 3rd place.
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years at the youngest up to over 70 years at the oldest starters.
In the main race, more absolute topathlets were at the start this year.
Four riders were able to drop off from the top regional drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-profi from the Black-Tusk-Racing team.
Pangerl, together with a teammate, was already two times the world champion in the twelve-hour ride.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls himself two German champion titles in the Duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, a eyelash finals came in the finish line in front of the three-sea hall.
Pangerl ran first over the finish line.
The Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall ranking only a second.
At the same time Hermann and Warthmann came to the finish as third of the overall ranking.
In the ladies' ranking, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
The second place was secured by Areane Blersch from Binzwangen before Natasha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sporters and helpers showed themselves very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized outcome of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical help to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is among the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him as "CN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle looked at how his sick father lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation spread to his brain, causing a hematoma to affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," Georges Bwelle said.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," said Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and it's not first.
There are many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for 5,000 people each, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for her, most Cameroonns could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his compatriots suffered seeing Bwelle mature the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
In addition, he founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas offering free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people force themselves into small buses and drive with the fastened medical equipment on the roof over unconnected terrain into the villages that need help.
It's not always going smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – is happy at the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team will begin to investigate hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," said Bwelle.
They come from a circle of 60 kilometers around the village – and that is on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local contaminants.
The operations usually take place in a school, a town hall or an apartment; after the surgery, the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the neighbor.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and thus Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It's a strenuous pensum, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They drumming all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team then goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free operations last year and knows that with their work it makes a huge difference for the people to whom it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a break that he had received now enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest of the tribes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's asleep," says Katie O'Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia and voluntarily cooperates in Bwelles Group.
He is always in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be in surgery where we help to drain blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay their journeys to Cameroon themselves and bring often donated sanitary material.
However, if they are first in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transportation and guidance.
"He is without a doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no limits.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise he gave to his father gives him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this job," said Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellent the fight mastered
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's Novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to the body.
Janson is himself an old hare in his metier, acting.
The old man Santiago can't do anything about fishing.
That's how the two simply complement themselves great.
It is almost said that the folds in the neck of the old man, who speaks of the fisherman Manolo, can be seen.
If Santiago is tired of living on the chair, that's true with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman through and through a role played by Janson is excellent.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his will.
Janson is alone on stage in a wide range.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologue is not a moment boring.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man in the boat operate in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the active scene: Santiago's hut, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise, who, with her songs and her wonderful voice, sings the life of Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
A waste water canal from the Roman era is preserved at about 120 metres below Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, you don't pass the cathedral.
Around 157 meters the two towers rise in the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who marvel at the two filigree church towers, suspect that there is a lot to discover even under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for its guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourism directly at the Cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted an auto-right city, and therefore, from the remains of the old city walls, only that which was not too large remained.
This is why most users of the car park hurry past the Roman remains today and just stop their car.
But those who look more closely in the parking deck D2 discover an archaeological site separated by metal lattice bars.
There are about five meters high ruins of hand plated stones.
"These are the remains of the Roman city walls built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before going back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper park level take a look into a dark, 15 meters deep box.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
The next stop of the tour is the premiere, and here the participants descend to the depths.
Here we experience the seat of the once most powerful man in the north of the Alps, the President of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which means in good German as much as "City Roman Right and City of Agrippines, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the emperor cult".
And the predatorium is the former governor's palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
A tunnel access to the Roman wastewater canal, which is preserved here at a length of about 120 metres, leads from the exhibition.
"You can quietly walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want", Schulze notes the guests.
There's still a surprise to Schulze.
After getting the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, walkable shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to reach the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing.
To date, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins go back to the eighth century.
The Mikwe becomes part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square for which construction work is to start shortly.
Until completion, however, a few years will pass.
Leg almost hacked: New edition of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is re-rolled after over four years.
A trial for attempted death, dangerous physical injury and damage to two 30-year-olds started in front of the Frankfurt Landgericht (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were silent at the beginning.
They were supposed to have been active in the rockers scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
In June 2009, the prosecutor's office accused them of stinging and beating three men in one car together with unknown complications in Finowfurt.
All the victims were severely injured, and a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are supposed to have heard of Hell's Angels competing group.
One should have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
It seems that there was a persecution hunt with several cars before.
According to the charges, there was a fight on the territory and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants had been exonerated in a first trial at the beginning of 2012.
A lawyer said at the time that it had not been proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof raised the ruling after the review of the prosecution and referred it back to the Landgericht for a renegotiation.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution because of another crime.
At the beginning it was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes on the Tatnacht.
As a witness, the Commissioner responsible for research at that time was invited.
In the center were cell phone calls from the defendants and other people who had stopped the police.
It's hard to say that Rocker is almost always in court to keep a law for her - and not to say it.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had been unboxed.
Procurator Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor's Office (Oder) said on demand that new traces have appeared since the last trial.
11 further negotiating days are scheduled for the process.
The Weewerfgesellschaft does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood good, but someday it's going home.
Only: In the bays of the people in the passenger and rear seat, hunger is evident.
Of course, one or the other cocktails or sects may be responsible!
What's closer to going to the next drive-in to make a little one?
I admit, I like to be with you when late night or early morning we go to fast food halls.
A few pommes, a cola, a burger, and then nothing like going home and bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gangs make themselves noticeable.
Because what does one need to miss that with steady regularity one throws its fast food bags out of the car window?!
Especially on weekends there are discarded paper bags on roadsides and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home respectful to the next trash?
It is not just the case that the paperware will contaminate the landscape.
Tüten have already covered transport facilities such as control boards, causing accidents.
About what the said "wegwerfgesellschaft" does not think, she probably doesn't even know what that word actually means.
When you're on the road more often in the evening, only with several people in the car, you know how a back seat can look after flooded nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage are storming.
There would be a few bags more or less but nothing - unlike the road, where nobody wants to mess around on the food remnants of others.
I already see the day coming when the cities and communities will be extinguished - and the fast-food chains must demand a deposit for their bags.
Obama's Repeal in Health Policy
After much criticism, President Obama made a retreat yesterday in his frequently repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of her insurers received a letter of termination, the Republicans in the last few days accused the U.S. public of being deceived by the president.
Yesterday Obama relativized his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a working health insurance can retain them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the terminations, Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to look after a new insurance on the free market.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or more favourable than forecasted.
"They come up with a better offer," he said.
The government said it was not surprising that the five per cent of the population that made insurance themselves would have to look for a different tariff because their contract did not meet the new standards according to the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say directly to these Americans that you deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the Washington House of Representatives.
Sebelius, responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform had been "missible" since October.
"I am just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement of a sebelius raised to a counsellor who was sitting behind her at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was taken up after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri. It was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly urged the question of why the "Architectin" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily refrain from a state-funded insurance scheme in order to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov itself, which they now want to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air force base
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday to the American news station CNN that Israeli fighters had attacked an air force base in the Syrian Latakia a day earlier.
According to CNN, the objective was "Rakes and related equipment" which the Israeli government feared they had been intended for Lebanese Hezbollah.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab transmitter Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base point in the port city of Latakia had been shot from Wednesday to Thursday, and the Israelis was responsible for it.
Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the base point in Latakia, on which Russian S-125 Neva defence missiles as well as a SA-3 rocket battery could be seen, according to which channel 2 has a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosive heads up to 70 kilograms.
Insecure The government in Jerusalem has officially failed to confirm the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believed Israel had launched the attack, but was not sure.
One speaker from the Israeli Ministry of Defense said, "We're not commenting on these reports."
In the daily Yedioth Ahronoth, journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed that the Syrian regime had previously, partly successfully, tried to deliver ground air missiles to the Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to provide Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant the crossing of a "red line" that would follow a military response.
John Kerry, in an unprecedented admission, explains that the American espionage had gone too far “unmeasured”
John Kerry, with an unexpected objection, indicated that the US's defence of its surveillance programmes was a evasion by saying that espionage had gone too far in certain cases.
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for putting on "autopilot" when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about the spying activities of the NSA.
Through the leaky information, the U.S. government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of disarmament on the part of its allies.
In a speech transmitted by video connection at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: "The President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned about some things that have almost passed by autopilot, simply because the ability to go back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to 11 September."
He was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to agree that US spying had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: 'In some cases it has gone too far.'
The President is determined to make clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse takes place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force of the good and that many lives had been saved through their monitoring operations.
He added: “We have to do with a new world where people are willing to blow themselves into the air.”
There is a radical extremism in the world who has been accustomed to killing people, spreading into the air and attacking governments.
So, what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, building attacks and human murder because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will travel to Europe to spread the concerns against the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in anti-terror efforts, as the president of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs declared on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had spoken this week to representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their threats of not participating in anti-terrorism organizations because of the frustration of the National Security Agency's surveillance.
"It is very important for the U.S. national security interests that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts to combat terrorism," said Murphy, who is sitting in the Senate for the first time as a democrat and as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes.
Media reports, according to which the NSA collected millions of telephone data in Europe, have burdened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence service said this week that the reports were inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents passed by Snowden, according to which the NSA monitored the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary and explained that this was common on both sides.
In all the Tumult, Murphy said his authority prepared the journey of the Congress to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also mentioned that there would be some "serious words".
He said that European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of spying programs they have been using for years.
"We can change our monitoring programmes and thus protect the rights of Europeans better, but they also have to deal with the fact that we are not the only ones who pioneer," Murphy says.
Meanwhile, John Kerry travels to the Middle East and Poland on the weekend to deal with the horror of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury at the jump joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga-Austraßspiel des FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz needs to use Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train with the team.
So far, he could only do so individually.
"We will decide on his commitment in the short term," said Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalkeeper with six hits.
For the Mainzers must already refrain from the injured service providers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian indicts appeal against prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket's prison because she had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver has filed an appeal against the verdict and was released on deposit.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15th to have made a false statement, after stating to the Thai police, a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10th, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she managed to figure out the story.
She was in police custody until the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the edge of Phukets instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League who has turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about the welfare of his daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are, of course, worried, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford filed an appeal against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 baht free of charge.
In Australian reports it was to read that in the meantime it is taking a vacation in the holiday resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
On the part of the court it was heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that, after the recent murder of the travel merchant Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may be trying to improve its affected tourist image, and therefore an exemption.
