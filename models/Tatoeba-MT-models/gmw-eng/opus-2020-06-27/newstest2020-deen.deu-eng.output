Fire deleted in French chemical industry
The large fire in a chemical plant that is considered particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen is erased. This was reported by the Normandie's prefecture on Friday. The fire broke out at night on Thursday. No one was injured during the incident. The fire brigade was in use with about 200 extinguishers.
The fire could be stopped
Anrainers were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives are manufactured for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol from U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements.
About 400 people work in the factory. In the past, the chemical factory has already provided headlines – for example, when a leak depleted the gas methanol and the environment far enough after lazy eggs. In 2015, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil were in the city's wastewater system after a operating accident.
Women quit their job to search for 57 days for their missing bitch
For two months a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and announced her job for that. The seven-year-old Border Collie had been removed from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days missing every trace from the bitch - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got bad," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake." She and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had panicked dog
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She's been traveling about four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake." When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie immediately ran out. Probably a loud thunder had put the dog in panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the kings searched for their beloved dog. But from days were weeks. "I have never given up. I have never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake" who announced her job as a postman in order to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie disappeared Carole King got a call: A man reported herself and said that Katie was in his court. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly stood her bitch under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," said King, "Daily Inter Lake." "The tears flowed. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found them."
Losses at the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear
Friday 27 September 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of fire munitions, including three machine guns. In most cases, the remains are unclear. The opposition speaks of a "frightening" extent.
At the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition disappear again and again - many of them so far. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 arms parts and nearly 20,000 shots ammunition. This is a list of the Federal Defense Ministry classified as closing issues, which the German editorial network reports on.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense State Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one piece of weapons and 3474 gun ammunition have so far appeared again. The weapons and parts of weapons still disappeared include six type MG3 machine guns, eleven type G3 rifles, four type G36 rifles, six signal guns and two type P8 guns. In addition, 30 type MG3 guns are missing for machine guns.
The scope of arms and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr is "frightful", said the left-wingman Martina Renner. This was all the more so because there was little discovery in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a "dark balance sheet." Renner criticised that the list was not recognizable whether under the disappeared ammunition there was also the one that had been found in connection with the investigations against the terrorist defence officer Franco A.. "And that even though a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned because of the possession of this ammunition," Renner said.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after his arrest by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As the ship observation data of Revinitive showed, the tanker moved and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but he remained in Iranian waters at first. It was from the shipping company that one wanted to wait for an official notice from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" had been accused on July 19 by the Iranian Revolution Guards in the Sea Road of Hormuz of breaching security provisions. However, it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary establishment of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar belonging to Britain.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil export is shipped through the seas. The tensions in the region have increased immensely in recent months. Trade shipping has been moved into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel appreciates the courage of man in the Peaceful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR, who went to the streets 30 years ago during the Peace Revolution. In the fall of 1989, courageous citizens had warned the former GDR regime, said Merkel at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU Group on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. Among other things, the chancellor recalled the occupation of the Stasi Central. "The state security was taken away from horror," she said.
Musk aims at extradition record
Teslas quarter may keep record ready. Despite extradition boom, there were last losses in the electric car group.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to bring cars to the clientele quickly. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla shares went out of trade with an increase of more than six percent. So much has the price not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to reach its high targets. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit figures have to be produced in the current and upcoming quarter year. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is needed, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Riddles solved: That's why we can't cuddle ourselves.
A kind of brake in the grand brain prevents people from capping themselves. With the help of experiments in rats, scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found out how they reported themselves on Thursday evenings. There was also progress on the question of why children are so violently fighting the kitzels, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the closeness of a kitzel's hand can only trigger laughter before the touch. This is due to a deep layer in the large brain, which already causes the laugh when the kitzel is expected.
According to the information, earlier research showed that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasonic area when they are grated by humans. This "laughter" is mediated by the part of the grand brain, which serves the central processing of the haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed while self - control
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-restraint and contact by others - that is why people cannot cuddle themselves. However, in the experiments in the rats, the Berlin researchers have now found that laughter as well as the activity of the area in question of the grand brains are suppressed during self-examination. This was also the case if living beings themselves clean themselves. During the foreign movement and the kitzel by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse had been made more laugh.
However, pass the self-indulgence and contact by others at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between self-indulgence and contact by others. The new findings suggest that people cannot cram themselves because self-indulge a brake in the large brain.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. Thus, in the experiment they sometimes broke off early, showed escape behaviour or horror. This ambivalence is similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of the kitzel is a behavioral reaction that is equal in rats and humans.
Disadvantage turned off: big fire deleted in French chemical plant
The large fire in an especially dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen is erased. This was reported by the prefecture of the Normandy of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire had broken out at night to Thursday.
According to authorities, no health-damaging substances should have been withdrawn. The samples taken give no cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with about 200 extinguishers.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.

In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives are produced for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol from US-Million Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
The chemical factory has already provided headlines in the past - for example, when a leak depleted the gas methanthiol in 2013 and the surrounding environment smelled far enough after lazy eggs. In 2015 some 2,000 litres of mineral oil were in the city's wastewater system after an operating accident.
Brexit: Johnson criticised by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session in Parliament after the suspension of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country without agreements from the EU on 31 October should not allow Brussels to respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
About Cox, who had been working for Britain's stay in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and to return to that country would have been to leave the EU." Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist in 2016 during the referendum election campaign.
Memorial on attacks by Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial will be revealed on Saturday in Norway in honor of the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose reproductions. They recall the roses that had been placed by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the Cathedral in Oslo.
At the same place, the project of the artist Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and victims. The opening is expected among other crown prince Haakon and crown prince Mette-Marit.
On 22 July 2011, the right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first fired a car bomb in Oslo's government district and shot dozens of participants in the youth organization of the social democratic workers' party following the Utöya island. Overall, 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is a less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran was able to get into the lake again. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran since mid-July is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew now travel for medical examinations to Dubai, said Reedereichef Erik Hånell. At noon the ship left the Iranian waters. "Beautiful that it is over," he told the Swedish TV station SVT.
"This is part of a model of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
On 19 July, the Iranian revolutionary Guards had been accused of disregarding regulations of the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. 16 crew members were doing well according to the circumstances, said Hånell. They had behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and exhilarating situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company now worked to bring them back together as soon as possible with their families.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar following the establishment of the "Stena Impero": there was a super-tanker with oil from Iran, which was intended for Syria, in early July. According to the authorities, the shipment was broken against EU sanctions against the war country of Syria. The reference to the ship had received the British from the USA.
Iran spoke of "Piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Presuming that it had been a exchange business to get the "Stena Impero" released, rejected London vehement.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the world’s oil exports are shipped through the seas. The tensions in the region have increased immensely in recent months. Trade shipping has been moved into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
The U.S. is behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington, the nuclear dispute between both countries. Americans are proposing to build nuclear weapons in Iran. Iran has rejected this. In 2018, the United States left the international nuclear agreement, which would prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb while ending its political and economic isolation. Since then, the U.S. government has been putting pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to impose a more stringent and extended agreement on other areas. Iran has been resisting the pressure so far.
Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil installations in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of the commercial ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the streets of Hormus at the UN Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protection powers, wanted to ensure the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined as a "war winner". In view of the fines imposed by US President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People’s Republic are forced to redisposition. Financial leaders of Asian companies who consider moving their production from China to another country, India is called one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. This, of course, has not only to do with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pool of young workers and an internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be designed to play a more important role in the worldwide wide-ranging production chain.
But now India itself is in Trump's focus. Depreciating from the Haudegen in the White House as the "kingdom of customs duties", America has removed from the emerging country at the beginning of June the trade advantages for 2000 products. The USA is prohibiting high tariffs and demanding better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and others.
On the world map of trade wars, the Reiberies with India are, of course, an off-the-board scene. In addition, America is looking at the world’s greatest democracy also through security-political glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concerns about China’s power claims in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salve of American criminal tariffs against India is unlikely. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term of office, should therefore be in security.
The problem lies, however, in another place: The empirically hardened thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development has a difficult state in the socialist Republic of India. His reform zeal also aims mainly at the bureaucratic irritantness, which has embroidered all too long in the multi-nation state of any entrepreneurial spirit. Companies now receive faster building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more tangible insolvency and bankruptcy law creates prerequisites for liquidating seemingly high-indebted companies more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In India, economic optics has greatly improved in the first five-year modes. However, this does not apply in trade policy. The national conservative government has even built new barriers in the interests of protecting less competitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, the modes of the energetic reformer's nimbus depend on the economic revolution of their country. This impression is due not least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like. In the core, however, the "India First" advocate never depended on a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from getting rid of anachronistic processes and thus becoming fit for global competition. Business people who survive due to the closure of their industries are among the tribal choices of modes nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and claps these short-sighted policies.
Replacement of Jacques Chirac in Paris on Monday
According to former French President Jacques Chirac, a report will be deposited in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, reported the news agency AFP calling on the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the narrow family circle. For Sunday, a public mourning ceremony in the Paris Invalidendom was held, as media reported.
Carrying the competitors to the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the athletics World Cup.
The top of the world has long been in the end when scenes from Aruba have been reheated in the cooled Khalifa International Stadium. In the first prelude of the men over 5000 meters Jonathan Busby started to fluctuate dangerously. He could hardly keep himself on his feet just 300 meters before the target, ran in an unsunded attitude when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly cut him under the attack and supported him the last half stadium round to the finish. However, the forces were still enough for both to stop the running watch after the finish.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly drew the attention of the assembled journalists. Shouting first he wanted to talk about his heroic action at all. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he realized that this would be difficult, he wanted only to help a suffering fellow. And anyway he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the World Cup by the World Cup. Under normal circumstances he shouldn't even have started. "That's why I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did so in the evening with emphasis - and much more intense than he would have thought. For this heroic act will remain in memory. At least Dabo even let his rival busby take the lead in the goal and voluntarily took the final place - by the way, well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega who won this prelude. It had nothing to do at the end, because the busby, which came into the finish only with much help, was disqualified precisely because of the end of the world-light athletics association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had arrived to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, he managed to do so at 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was under 18 minutes already." However, only in training, there are no best times.
Millions of Mass: Egyptians equip themselves for wild protest day
In Egypt the security measures in advance of possible government-critical protests have been reinforced. In the centre of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir square were blocked.
In recent days the police had reinforced their road controls and partially searched pedestrian cell phones for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two NGOs.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura protested with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who accused critics of corruption and mismanagement. For today's Friday, there had not been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt. Ali calls for a "people's revolution" for the Spanish exile. The man is also not a "good man" for most young Egyptians, because he has beaten millions of them to the army, but his messages arrive.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to rise. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) (ECRF) had more than 1.570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures were not confirmed at first. The government also did not confirm and commented on the figures.
Random arrests
Many people had been arrested "willfully," "only because they were "at the wrong time in the wrong place," said HRW, calling on lawyers to arrest prisoners. The accusations against the arrested reach out to their lawyers from "proliferation of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities surveyed and searched security forces in uniform, but also in civil clothing, according to HRW statements also arbitrary passers-by.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Therefore, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online dealer: shipping dealers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online dealers, many returned parcels are lost goods. About 20 million returns land on the garbage. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although it is not possible to exempt the companies from the sales tax on material donations, the Ministry stated on a question of the Greens-Bundestag Group, which the newspapers of the Funke-Mediengruppe reported on Friday, but could place the market value of the unsales returns so low that they would not have to pay any or only a small amount of turnover tax.
Scientists from the University of Bamberg had determined that, when ordering orders on the Internet, the Germans returned every sixth package. Around four percent of the goods - some 20 million products - subsequently landed in the garbage. They would also cost companies, according to current legal situation, because the financial authorities evaluate donations such as sales, which then apply to sales tax.
Green Group Minister Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with a decree that companies cannot assess the products they buy and donate for free to non-profit organisations. Companies would have to be able to rely on not being punished for donations. This was not only for online trade but also for other shops from fashion shop to construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There never was a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is to be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksys's work "emphasizes the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world in the basic care of animals and tribes." From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is auctioned on October 3rd. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 in the Museum of Bristol in the Southwest of Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion the work, which used to be called "question hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million years.
Finally, on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had delivered a hard exchange of stroke with the opposition at the first meeting of the Unterhaus after a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to carry out Brexit, which has already been postponed twice on 31 October, if necessary without any agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover in southeastern England, he painted a picture depicting a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "spice in the park"
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's violent verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the 2016 election campaign before the Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a "spice in the park", said Dominic Cummings at a book presentation on Friday. "We enjoy that. We will leave (out of the EU) and we will win".
In recent days, Johnson had severely attacked Brexit opponents and, among other things, accused them of "treasoning" on the people. Charges that he could put the Members at risk because they could become the target of threats of murder, he acted as "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to return to rest was if Members finally respected the decision of the British to leave the EU, and it was not surprising that the people were told that the United Kingdom had still not resigned from the EU three years after the referendum.
In the face of the charged atmosphere, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should listen too."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for Uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again invited the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the UN Assembly.
Otherwise, a further war between Pakistan and India was likely, said Khan at the UN General debate in New York on Friday. "If this is going badly, you hope for the best, but are prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it."
Since its independence from British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have waged three wars, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers have a part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August India had withdrawn the autonomy status of the Indian Kashmir region and thus raised tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo are demanding the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government reacts with a hard hand against the current protests in Egypt. With sharp ammunition it has been shooting at the populace, more than 2,000 prisoners joined in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in there. Protesting has never been safe in Egypt. But since the takeover of power by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus is doing everything to avoid a scenario like at times of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, perceptiveness and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drive millions to the streets. And that’s a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not get a grip on, no matter how hard it goes against adversaries. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third party lives in Egypt under the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket has to decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the repression but also the largest economic player. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. This was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one.
Tüv checks in terminal: BER-Chef: No "Show stoppers" anymore for capital airport
Two months have been checked whether the complicated plant association works in interaction with the BER-Brandschutz. The operators are satisfied with the course. However, the Tüv is not finished at the BER.
According to large-scale Tüv checks at the terminal of the future capital airport, operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Supervisory Board Chief Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control body.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed examination, but also said that there are still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we don't have a real show stopper." He assured that the schedule until commissioning is still buffer.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction completion display will now be submitted to the Construction Office during the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of power cables have yet to be fixed; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the take-up of the flight operation, it is necessary to continue working intensively on the handling of the defects," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there is a lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all dowels on which the cable races hang. The airport chief expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the passage to the station under the terminal is not yet satisfactory. The problems of the project had led to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke sluggishes that run down on a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread out. They go too far down. 36 engines therefore have to be exchanged. Then there is to be new attempts with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
The opening of the airport has been slowing down for years with fire protection and other tree stems as well as planning errors. Originally, it should start operating in 2011. Since the beginning of 2006 costs have increased from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros at the opening of the next year.
Since the passenger numbers have risen significantly in Berlin, the controllers plan to expand the airport. Therefore, a special meeting of the Supervisory Board should take place on 18 October, as the chairman announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Finance chief Heike Fölster will change to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, staff head Manfred Bobke-von Camen will be in retirement next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Automats for Drugs - Police arrests man
He needed money for drugs - and put several machines in the Chemnitz city area in the air! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
Over the past two years, the number of broken cigarettes and parking licenses in Chemnitz and the region has risen considerably. It was a million damage!
After two demonstrations at the end of May, the police caught a 33-year-old German on the Bürgerstraße and on Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesperson Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation due to the use of explosive explosions in actuality with a particularly severe case of the theft led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only did this suspicion against the 33-year-olds confirm itself".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now had a total of eight acts.
The police spokesperson: "With the prey, he apparently financed his drug dependence."Only four times did the bomber blow parking machines on the Bürgerstraße between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage incurred is at least 60 000 euros!
The Automated Bomber is now in custody, and the police investigation against him continues.
It is thought that he was also responsible for other automatings in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is changing its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the middle of the competition with low-cost flyers such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa subsidiary AUA takes over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed on Friday a press speaker from Austrian Airlines to the APA. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa ticket pilot Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. From January 2020 onwards, the AUA will take over the "Wetlease", including Eurowings personnel. In Salzburg three Eurowings jets will be stationed, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck to holiday destinations as charter machines. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Deutschland.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA crossroads and network planning, said the speaker. The flight times will be coordinated on connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen Vienna’s hub and, on the other hand, to develop decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serve as a "production company" for the company sister AUA. Among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight numbers, but mainly with Eurowings equipment. The on-board product should be adapted to those of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights running under AUA flight number are no longer made in Terminal 1, but in the same way as the AUA in Terminal 3.
At Vienna Airport, a price battle has broke out after the Niki Pathe. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced that the fleet in Vienna next summer would be increased to 16 aircraft. The Irish cheap pilot will send four airline machines together with crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the union criticised as a round-up construct for the collective agreement.
On Friday, Air Director Michael O'Leary's fight statement that Lauda will have passed the AUA in five years, he replied: "We will remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years."
Queen-Engine Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) will have stopped in the Italian holidays at the beginning of the month around the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31).
"We are extremely pleased to be able to announce our engagement. We are both so pleased to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be actually married," the British media report reported to the couple in the official communication since October 2018.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us in the coming years full of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos recorded their sister, Princess Eugenie (29) and also published on their Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information about the date, place and everything else will announce the palace in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the mutilation of the number nine of the British throne order and the real estate mogul will become a similar great feast as the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what does a heart weakness or an infarction really work out? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the heritage of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the heritage of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find more detailed evidence of the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of this type in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the high mountain clinic Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich is involved.
Overweight, smoking, and unhealthy nutrition are among the major influenceable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not known enough, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete inheritance of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Container Center at the UKE.
At present, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known as possible disease - causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - were called the clinic. Each year about 200 are added.
According to the initiators, the five-year project aims to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attack. The data could also be useful in researching other diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vessel Center. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney, as well as cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a firm desire to use the data for the research of other diseases. So far, the Institute of the Foundation in Davos is treating allergies. Now, at the medical campus there, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created and a professorship for bioinformatics created. To justify his commitment, the logistics contractor living in Switzerland said that he had been operating in Hamburg at the open heart three years ago and was very grateful.
The biotests of healthy participants come from hamburgers who also participate in the Hamburg City Health Study. With 45,000 subjects, according to the hospital, this is the world’s largest local health study. During the inheritance encryption, the scientists are strictly respected for the protection of the anonymous data. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich said.
According to UKE, the genetic material of a human being can be decrypted within 24 hours. The pure cost of the property is 1300 euros. The first gene sequence worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is due to begin on October 1, already at the end of 2020, all 9000 samples will be analysed. The first results are expected in the year after that.
Nigerian Police Release Hundreds of Mistreated Boys
In Nigeria, the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to hints from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some of the still minor victims, as police spokesperson Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were mistreated. Some of them reported being raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys had been held under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. In fact, the shooters had been held by their teachers under "the most inhumane and most inhumane conditions," said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children of the age of nine, had been chained in a small space.
According to the Koran School, the information existed for about ten years. Residents would have drawn attention to repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents would have been shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran School, said Sabo. They would not have thought of the sufferings of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to police.
There are many private Koran Schools in the mainly Muslim north of Nigeria. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed gangs. According to the UN refugee aid work, over 40,000 people have fled across the border in the neighbouring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and Tortured: Nigeria's Police Freed 400 Children from School
Police in a school in northern Nigeria have liberated nearly 400 students from terrible conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries pointing to torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children had been discovered on Thursday after an indication in an Islamic school. The states there were "unworthy" of men. The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation campaign.
The children, all young, had been held at their school like slaves and laid on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television pictures showed muttered and injured students in a recognizable poor state of health.
World football election: Other accusations about Messis and Klopps Kür
Football signature invalid
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a Gala in Milan, the world football association Fifa is awarded the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua’s captain declared that he had never voted in the World Football Election, accusations came from other countries to the Fifa. Egypt was not valued at all - with a curious justification.
In recent years, much of the Fifa has proved to be an insidious thing: the World Championships, dubiose plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa World Fußballer-Wahl has not yet been suspected of running out of the air - if one does not see that the voting national trainers and national team members of member associations often vote according to sympathy rather than objectively estimate.
But since Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now happening: Egypt complains that the votes of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly available voting table.
Fifa apologises to the fact that "the signatures were placed on the election forms in capital letters and were therefore not valid". The Egyptian Association had been contacted several times in order to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudan's coach is also surprised
There is also a cry from Sudan regarding the choice. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not agree as it was finally appreciated: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. However, Fifa said that the vote had taken the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
The accusations had also raised Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera: "Habe did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All details about my voice are wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted in its name.
On Friday the news came from the association: voting, but of course there was no intention. The completed electoral documents were "irritally" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was called in a communication from the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas actually chose. "We assume responsibility for the administrative error", it was stated in the communication. But both Rosas and team captain Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "just as it is in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases now let the Fifa examine in one investigation, but emphasizes that the electoral process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains undisputed winner of the world football election - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine-Affair: Ranghohe Republicans advocate for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have expressed themselves openly for an official investigation against the U.S. presidents and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are found." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the suspension of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the democratic candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump Biden "has been observing years".
The Republicans have so far held back criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, few have been disillusioned. Scott’s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. The moderate governor of Virginia had repeatedly opposed Trump’s policy, for example, against the loosening of environmental regulations and the strengthening of immigration regulations.
As other prominent Republicans, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for the Congress is now to investigate the matter and go to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governor of U.S. states, have formally no participation in the trial against Trump, which is decided in the Congress. Their statements are therefore particularly symbolic. Nevertheless, first senators of Republicans have critically expressed themselves about the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". U.S. media also report that among Republicans internal cracks occurred.
The affair could result in the initiation of an official dissent against Trump, the democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation. They propose to him abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the administrative dissertation procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could exert a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on an actual dissertation of office fell in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for success of such a procedure are small.
Were torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had unauthorisedly controlled the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After violent protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was abolished after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious accusations against rockets are being made. Three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been caught in a reception camp in Messina, Sicily, after migrants have recognized their torments in Italy. "We can't exclude this, but we don't even have any secure information about it," said Sea Watch speaker Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country raped, tortured and even murdered. It was Mohamed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and exposed to horrors - by repeated and constant physical violence," it was stated in the communication.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee Libya. It is therefore quite likely that they are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed".
Italy's judge former Minister of State Matteo Salvini called for an excuse from Rackete, against whom aid for illegal immigration is still being found in Italy, immediately.
Musk aims at delivery record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong so that Tesla could book 110.000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to bring cars to the clientele quickly. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla shares went out of trade with an increase of more than six percent. So much has the price not increased for nearly four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to reach its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 350,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures have to be produced in the current and upcoming quarter year. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is needed, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
US budget dispute: Renews only a bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in the spending ceiling for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States once again stand without spending plans before the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision it would have come to a Shutdown on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump must put the decision into effect.
Shut Down Turned Off
This is because the Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. The Federal Administration cannot therefore benefit from the extended expenditure framework for the new financial year from 1.3 bio. to $1.4 bio.
The democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect priorities of the Democrats who have little opportunity in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate has also prepared ten of the twelve spending plans more or less, which are hardly able to do so.
In the Senate, Republicans are apparently trying to impose $12 billion on the construction of the wall, one of President Trump’s major priorities. The Democrats are disrupting the building plans and the financing that is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The struggle over the wall construction was escalated in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the mural construction the spirits separate
At present, it is unclear how the parties would like to approach this question. More likely than an agreement on all twelve expenditure laws over the next seven weeks is an extension of transitional financing beyond 21 November. Also a shutdown is not excluded.
Against the background of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree on the 12 spending laws in due time, and the associated risk of a Shutdown win ideas for the automation of the process of popularity. Template p. 1877 to avoid Shutdowns, the funding of the federal administration would automatically continue at the previous year's level, block the travel activity of parliamentarians and hold back their wages until the new annual expenditure plans are available.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, the artificial fertilization of single women and lesbians is to be exposed in future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill which allows all women to use in vitro fertilization, which is expected to significantly increase the demand for anonymous seed donations.
The proposal still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics had warned in the right camp that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up. The French Bishops' Conference is also opposed to the innovation.
The new regulation is the core element of a bioethics law, which defended health minister Agnès Buzyn as a "chance" for society. It pictures the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to their idea, the cost of artificial fertilizations for all women is to be borne by social insurance.
Fertilization with sperm from dead husband
By a small majority, the National Assembly, on the other hand, rejected an amendment which would allow widows to have an artificial fertilization access to the sperm of their dead husband. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, the artificial fertilization "post-mortem" is permitted. In Germany, there were cases in which women in vain complained about the release of the sperm of a deceased.
Many members of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic in motion, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had spoken out for artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would impose a "double sorrow" if her husband's child's desire remained unfulfilled by the death of her husband.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that in the future a widow can be fertilised with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is only permitted heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in summer that the motherhood continued to remain prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - it is still often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Balance payment for the climate: Calls for flight charges for Unis become louder
A great deal is being flown to universities, which is why the country is planning to take a climate tax in the future, and the rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also be limited to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The debate before the summer break on a climate tax on flights from universities and universities is on the rise again. After the national rectors' conference had skeptically responded to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint declaration the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogic university advocated a compensation for service flights. This is the first step that is needed as a first step, at the same time there must be a broad debate on the preventability of flights, it says in their opinion. The cabinet decision originally planned in July is now still on ice because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the greens.
Russia is again recording North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB intelligence service, the arrested were to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was a shooting shift between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, and the fisherman later suffered his severe injuries. This time, however, there were no injured people.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages, so North Korean fishermen were on their way to Russian territorial waters. There, Russia's Coast Guard runs patrols according to their own data on the protection of their marine biological resources.
30,000 squid seized
During the re-checking, 30,000 squid were discovered and seized on the boats. In addition, three fishing and two motor boats were confiscated and transported to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia’s fisheries authority had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year after complaints by local entrepreneurs. According to media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, also complained recently about high ecological damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these, also small creatures would be taken out of the sea. Furthermore, the networks would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be broken down.
Only 18,000 in the future: USA lower asylum upper limit
The "greatest nation in history" – Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is facing security seekers. As Foreign Minister confirmed in Washington, the ceiling for the legal migration of refugees is further reduced. In future, particularly threatened believers and Iraqis are expected to receive asylum.
The U.S. government intends to reduce the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees once again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, no more than 18,000 people will be left to the country, as the US Foreign Ministry stated. In the year that has already almost expired, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has dramatically reduced the willingness to accept protection seekers from all over the world over the past years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, far higher reception limits had gone.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the launch of the US refugee program in 1980. The US Foreign Ministry nevertheless referred to the U.S. as "most merciful and most generous nation in history", a formulation that is strongly reminiscent of the language use of the US President.
A "responsible handling" of refugees aims to enable refugees to return to their home countries in order to help in reconstruction, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he gets a lot of support from followers, but there is also massive criticism.
In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the state of emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic policy developments in the US capital, Trump is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a potentially threatening process of official dissertation.
In future, the US government intends to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups, following representation from the Office: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who helped the US military in the country and thereby risked the outcome of the Declaration of the Foreign Ministry. Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, are to receive maximum 1500 refugees.
The United States wants to achieve asylum in particular from this "north triangle" of Central America in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras to reduce immigration at the US south border to Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former zoo of Buenos Aires to a reception station in the United States at the request of Argentine justice. Born in the Rostock Zoo in 1986, the "Sandra" was granted the rights of a "non-human person" because of this, she was forced to release. The animal was brought by direct flight to Dallas on Thursday night - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Dominguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of human monkeys are unable to adapt to their lives in the wilderness, they are expected to live in the open-air shelter of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 more orang Utans and 31 chimpans, among them "Bubbles", formerly pet by Popstar Michael Jackson. Before entering Florida, however, "Sandra" has to endure a 40-day quarantine at Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, the U.S. state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" fundamental rights by animal protectors in 2014 has contributed to the conversion of the zoo of Buenos Aires into an eco-park.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new Husarer ride on the nearly 3,000-metre-high Great Tinne in the Italian Alps.
Without network, double floor or other tools, the Swiss forced the 550-metre-high north wall of the Great Tin in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute slippery freedom, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. So he failed the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder in the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sports goods manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in profits. Net profit rose in the past quarter to 1.4 billion dollars (approx. 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year’s period, as the Group announced on Tuesday. For this reason, the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct" with which the Adidas competitor directly addresses its customers online.
In the three-month period until the end of August, sales rose to 10.7 billion dollars. Nike's sales figures increased by 22 percent in China. As a result, the Beaverton Group in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited from its approach to direct consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps in the People's Republic.
Financial chief Andy Campion announced that Nike will further drive the "digital transformation" of the sports goods manufacturer with strategic investments, thus increasing its competitive advantage. Investors were looking forward to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Life-long stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club of the Italian capital imposed a lifelong ban on stadiums against a fan. Jesus, who came from Brazil, had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and called upon his club to take action."@ocificalasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Stolz, to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded on late Thursday. He reported the fan's account at Instagram and the police. Furthermore, the Roma trailer should never visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly scan racist abuses against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or sports. In Italy the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. One must identify the responsible and throw out of the stadiums," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. Reasons for the statement were racist singing at the First League party between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence last Sunday.
But also for the followers of Juventus Turin, there were last discussions. The Italian authorities have now made 38 bridal fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them should no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police reported. Moreover, bans of four to seven years apply.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups in the Juventus area. The twelve are accused of serious extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had taken over the investigations with an ad last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-stewards should have filed tickets behind the black trade. They would have controlled the ticket trade for the fan curve "militarily controlled" and should have extorted Juventus employees in order to get on cheaper cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - whole-years are thought of with catchy terms. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the individual feelings of life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" On September 21st, this reputation officially started the crab fishing at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, where the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival was also introduced, as the public relations department of the Nanjing Gaochun District Committee announced.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothill of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ecologically ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, the people of Gaochun started to grow crabs. Over the years, the crab industry has developed into a significant sector that has made high incomes and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In the past years, Gaochun has actively sought a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab breeding as well as technology-based crab breeding. And the city has taken care of the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and the incomes of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has launched a reform on "Dissemination of Power, Optimization of Administration and Government Services" and has taken care to build up the service network for "Guests under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending" to fully optimize the environment for licensing, services and for development.
Gaochun fully exploits the local benefits of connecting to the southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui and uses the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a signpost to provide intelligent high-end production plants, biomedicine and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sectors, as well as environmental agriculture, which are leading in the "3+2" sector. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national tourism zone and tourism areas of national importance. It is worth taking part in the environmental and cultural resources of the landscape of Gaochun, the state of buildings for public services and for public service, the areas of "Tourism +" and "+ Tourism" and the development of cultural tourism at a high quality level. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict between Iran and USA: Ruhani speaks of end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the UN Assembly, spoke of an alleged US offer to abolish sanctions. In return for talks with the Tehran leadership, the United States would have expected an end to all sanctions, explained Ruhani on its official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, objected to the Iranian colleague on Twitter: "I wanted Iran to remove the sanctions imposed on him so that there was a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the situation as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had insisted that a meeting be held. "And America says that I am raising the sanctions," added Ruhani. The kind of criminal measures that should be brought to an end have been put to the debate. "And they have clearly said that we are raising all sanctions."
However, this action was not in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticised. In view of the current criminal measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran, which is to stop the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet US President Donald Trump on the brink of the UN Assembly.
Heavy Earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 Postquakes
After Western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within the shortest time, the fear of a catastrophe grows. 34 people were injured during the Tuesday earthquake. Since the earthquake on the day before, there have been nearly 200 afterquakes, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday. Thus, the concern for a disaster grows.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. The earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the millions of metropolises. Now the government wants to use a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for tremors, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is always ignored. Every year, badly built houses fall in - including must be made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Town planners such as the famous architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces, which were registered in the center as refuge places, have long been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük-Beit in August had the Istanbul Building Engineering Chamber warned that estimated a million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the earthquake of Thursday was in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometres deep, as the Afad disaster protection authority reported. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu announced on Twitter that damage or damage had not been reported at first. The TRT State Station showed people who ran from the houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings in the Silivri District for security reasons. Some students wept as can be seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly endangered. Under the Marmara Sea there is a section of the so-called North Anatolic Disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolic Earth Plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake near Istanbul in 1999. At that time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of strength could threaten 7.1 to 7.4. But when the earthquake comes to the earthquake is unclear. In the earthquake on Thursday, the West of the country and Istanbul met again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have packed up so-called Go-Bags with everything necessary besides house doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the Earth wakes up. When the next big earthquake comes, it is unclear.
After his return from New York, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul disaster coordination center (Akom), according to which two minarettes of mosques crashed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning about posters in Istanbul
In the social networks many users of panic report. Buildings were waved. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more severe than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Half Moon, Kerem Klinik, warned by Twitter about aftershocking. He called on people to stay away from buildings that suffered visible damage.
According to the official information, the time of the earthquake is stated at 13.59 a.m. (local time). Just a few minutes after the first earthquake, CNN Turkey reported that there was a postquake with a strength of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of strength 4.6 shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was to feel to Istanbul. Also, its epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the millions of metropolises, the disaster protection authority Afad announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines on this Tuesday: Pakistan, too, was hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that they will eventually release themselves - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. As a result, he said to CNN Türk. "This could be the signs of a major earthquake," says Ersoy to the station. "In the early days or later, the great earthquake will come."
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the earthquake caused great concern in Istanbul too. Moreover, in Albania there was only a few days ago a severe earthquake - there was 68 injured. Also at Lake Constance this year the earth had buried.
Parliament: new fuel in Ukraine-Affair
Two brilliant documents provide new ignition in the Ukraine affair for potential abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible official theorem procedure, the U.S. Democrats are seen to be strengthening: The complaint filed by an anonymous notifier about Trump and its controversial telephone call with the Ukrainian president mountains is important evidence of investigations against the president. Trump himself sees himself as victims of a "hex hunt". In addition, he doubted the credibility of the whistleflower.
USA: passenger of United Airlines locked in toilet - pilot rerouted
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight from United Airlines was rerouted. The WC door had been blocked from Washington to San Francisco during the flight in 1554, according to US Media, the airline announced.
After a stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally freed from the narrow cabin. About an hour had she been imprisoned in it, U.S. media were called on to other passengers. To continue to the direction of San Francisco, passengers had to switch the machine.
In a video that is distributed on the Internet, according to U.S. media from Flight 1554, we can see how several people try to free the woman. "We are working at the moment to open the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline has apologized to all passengers.
The cockroache: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Change", British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about Brexit chaos in Great Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on 27 November, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) reported. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his earlier life, but now is at once the most powerful man of Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action and is wildly determined to let himself be stopped by nothing and no one.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If Parliament is closed so that the government can not be challenged at a critical moment if ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders, if Brexites in high positions precisely try the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer: write." McEwan had only appeared in the spring of the novel "Machines like me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafkas first published in 1915 is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "to be transformed into an immense monster," is gradually excluded from family and society and ultimately perishes. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that stands its head," said Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests €9.5 million in Austria's railway infrastructure
11.200 Wagons in Austria and Hungary get floss brakes to reduce the noise load caused by freight trains. Furthermore, sections of rail connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to EU authorities, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travels cancelled until 31 October
One day after his insolvency contract, German tour operator Thomas Cook canceled all travel until and including 31 October 2019. Travels could "not be made for insolvency reasons", the company announced on Thursday evening.
Bookings of Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which are already paid or paid in full, are also covered. As is the case with travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In agreement with insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it was called.
Thomas Cook in Germany had joined the British parent group's ploy and had filed insolvency on Wednesday. The company, including Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurers wants to transfer money to hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday hotels abroad, which still host Thomas-Cook holidaymakers, will receive money from the Zurich insurance. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked for extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without the submission of separate invoices, hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as said by a Zurich spokesperson of the German Press Agency. "This applies immediately and on condition that Thomas-Cook-Residencers from these hotels will not be asked for individual payment of hotel bills or otherwise be required," said spokesperson Bernd Engelien.
The insurance was therefore responding to reports of hotel guests who, according to their own information, had been forced to pay their accommodation on site. Some therefore had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticized this.
As many hotels are concerned, on Friday we will be voting with the insolvent travel provider, the insurance speaker said. According to the Thursday, 70 000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschal holidaymakers from Germany were on their way. Zurich Germany has secured holidays and returns from Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payouts of hotels by Zurich Insurance only help the travellers who are still on the road. Thomas-Cook customers, who are still planning to fly on vacation, do not look good. On the late Thursday evening, the company announced that all the travels would be cancelled until October 31st. This was also true for those bookings that have already been paid.
The company was left open as regards travel starting from 1 November 2019. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it was called. In principle, insurance Zurich is also responsible for these cases.
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys blast mine in Angola
Prince Harry has long continued the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa, he is now moving directly to the tracks of his mother.
The British Prince Harry in Angola has fired and destroyed an explosion mine with a blue barrier vest.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust in the village of Dirico, he created the ignition circle on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the savanna landscape without harm. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the bloody conflict in the African country for decades, there are still more than 1,000 mine fields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry then wanted to walk directly on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same champion, who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to return the path she was going to. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a spacious minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She too had demonstrated support for Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African journey since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated: with him there will be a third suspension of the Brexit negotiations, but what statements are of an eternal duration for the polarizing British. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in Great Britain floats like a damokle dispute over the blondhead. His suspension of Parliament in order to be able to break its Brexit course until the date of departure was cancelled at the beginning of this week. And a law passed by Parliament undertakes to carry out an extension of bilateral talks with the EU until 31 October. Johnson had always excluded that.
Boris Johnson still thinks deal is possible
But the pressure does not seem to go by Johnson, either. Meanwhile, when he visits a hospital, he made indications that he supports an extension of the negotiations in the event of a failure by the end of October:
You know, we're going to keep the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by October 31st.
And best with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that this works.
And the time is running out of the Brexit handlers in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators have just about six weeks to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without any agreements. But the recent talks have not yet reached any breakthrough. An agreement until the end of October is currently more difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a renewed postponement of the date of withdrawal is in force. The opposition, however, does not trust the Prime Minister’s words. It fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the case of a no-deal.
U.S. authorities: Other deaths caused by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has risen to twelve. In addition, there have been now 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this context, the U.S. Health Authority reported CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there have already been more than 900 affected persons, approximately 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. No similar increase in lung damage has been known in Europe so far. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the USA.
The fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
The videos of Muhammad Ali have been shared in online networks millions of times. The Spanish-based contractor and actor calls for a "volks revolution". Today, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which are accused of critical corruption and mis-economic abuse. Ali hopes for mass rallies with a million participants in central places in the country.
The security authorities are alarmed at any rate. In the centre of Cairo, an increased police presence had already been observed. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir square were locked. Already in the past days the police had reinforced their road controls and the mobile phones of pedestrians had partially searched for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20th, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. The security forces responded with it. According to information from the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), nearly 2000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested - just because they were "in the wrong place for wrong time," HRW informed with appeal to lawyers.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Hence, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after crashing the democratically elected Islamic President Muhammad Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been detained and partially condemned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. He was welcomed on his arrival in the port of Hamburg, among other things by Skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg over the Atlantic with the race yacht "Malicia".
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the effects of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He has been waiting for years for the young generation to speak. You know for decades that the earth is heating up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under the exclusion of the public," Fuchs said. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of global warming and marine pollution. Expedition had, among other things, been measured with a drone of Greenland’s glacier ice cream and fished with networks of microplastics.
The Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" for his "Camp for Sustainable and Respectful Use of the World Seas" as part of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who love the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great model," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness of the changes that have taken place in the Arctic over the last decades."
Teure Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for noodles 430 euros
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Engelsburg in Rome: this seemed to be two Japanese tourists too much. Although the bill with 80 euros of drinking money was paid by the two women, they posted the receipt on Facebook, which caused hot reactions.
"Such cases harm the reputation of Rome. We call on the police to consider whether this is a fraud," asked a speaker from Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
Prompt was the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese had ordered not only spaghetti but also fresh fish, but the local owner justified himself. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. Also, a drink of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, the guest said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could, after the turbulent revelations of the past days, actually face an official theft, the democrats want to examine this as quickly as possible with their investigation in the House of Representatives - the speech is from weeks to a decision would fall.
At the beginning of the scandal, the phone call to the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is said to have been launched. The accusation of the Whistleblower, who finally brought the conversation out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the United States with his complaint to the public: The President abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the 2020 election. He extortioned Ukraine's dependence and forced them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to understand the now published co-writing of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full text. However, the telephone of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, in whose center, alongside Trump, is above all his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public's perspective in May 2019, the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans reported to Ukraine. He wants to meet with President Selenskyj, who is just elected, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are horrific. "We do not interfere with a choice, we interfere in an investigation about what we have the right," he says. One might think it's inappropriate, but "there's nothing illegal." Giuliani wants to be persecuted in Ukraine for investigations for which there is hardly any basis - "because this information is very, very helpful for my clients and could be seen as helpful for my government."
The lawyer and former mayor of New York seems to have been infected with right conspiracy fantasies fixed on Trump’s counterpart at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton was inspired by actors in Ukraine, said critics back then to construct an occasion for Russia’s investigations in the US. This accusation was never serious.
This is precisely about the investigations that Trump will talk about on the phone with Selenskyj so prominently in July. The version of Giuliani's and the President is: the former Vice President and currently prospective candidates for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as Ukraine's commander of the Obama government has pushed on the release of the then Ukrainian general prosecutor, Wiktor Schokin, to stop the investigation of the gas company in which his son Hunter Biden was working. Biden senior had been financially extorted by Ukraine to cover up the corrupt machinations of his family.
In fact, the process was a little different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian general prosecutor should go, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Furthermore, Schokin himself was deeply accused of corrupt gestures, the U.S. government was not the only western partner to push his release. Furthermore, the Obama government also explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Disorders at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions at Instagram and Facebook. Hence, Germany, the UK and Spain are particularly affected. On the website all disorders.de users report that Facebook has not been loading again and again since about 15.30 pm. Instagram also shows the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disorder, though not so far.
Instagram and Co. often affected by disturbances
It is not the first massive accident this year. Already in March and July, the services had fallen out for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also use Twitter this time mainly to make their anger air.
Polish Scientists Saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the Chilean air force from the ice of Antarctica. They were on their way with a boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in disaster - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for storage.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean air brigade:
"At 9:30 o'clock we received the message, just before ten o'clock we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the boat."
Poland has operated on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers have been brought back to their research station.
Warning: Smartphone NOT cordless charging
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi-standard is extremely practical, but should not be used anyway.
Since several new smartphones have recently come to the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - first and foremost the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. This is, according to the knowledge of the University of Warwick, extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly larger heat development. If you store a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery is heated to 27 degrees within three hours. During the wireless charging process, however, the researchers have always measured over 30 degrees even when the smartphone is perfectly aligned on the charging path. If the mobile phone is located slightly next to the coil, the temperature is even higher. Furthermore, the watt strength of the charging pad increases, which in turn drives the power consumption to the height.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a decisive factor. Every single degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but also does not last as long. Thus, the life span is lower. The researchers therefore advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since an battery exchange is always connected with high costs for modern smartphones, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has even increased the cost of battery exchange – even for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: simply place the device on a suitable charging path - they are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without a noisey cable salad and a difficult plugfummei. Since Qi (is for inductive energy transmission) enforces a global standard, which, exceptionally, even has Apple, there are few restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau-Photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
According to his own information, a Nepalese mountaineer climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition organizer informed.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousands in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He once made international headlines: He comes from a picture of climbers who had gone virally in the spring, standing on Mount Everest snake.
The image of mass and rank triggered a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 meter high mountain and the highest summit of the earth. In May eleven climbers died in the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. Among other things, it is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wanted to speak to China to enable him to ascend.
Four Dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a sad elephant cow, a police speaker announced on Friday. "We suspect the elephants were poisoned."
The four cadavers were found in a protected area close to the famous and visited by many tourists earlier rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesperson, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was arranged to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers, in whose land the animals had previously held themselves harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants each year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
According to estimates in Sri Lanka, only about 7,000 elephants live. The death penalty is theoretically due to their killing.
Stable British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas for more than two months after his arrest by Iran. This was announced by the shipping agency Bandar Abbas by the IRNA News Agency. The Iranian revolutionary guards had imposed the claims of the British flag tankers on 19 July to have disregarded the regulations of maritime law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in the Criticism
The competent economic committee of the Unterhaus wants to examine in a comprehensive manner the  Pleite of the travel giant Thomas Cook. It is intended to deal with the salary packages of the board as well as with the question of why the British government was not allowed to contribute financially to the company that struggles for survival. "Our interest is the supervision of the company as well as the control of external auditors," said the Chairman of the Committee Rachel Reeves in London. "Of course, we are dealing with a bad example of management greed."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of intestinal cancer
The role of genes in the family increased risk of intestinal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers of the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg are now coming to this conclusion in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family nutrition habits are likely to weigh more than previously. This has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of intestinal cancer, the DKFZ scientists stress.
Elon Musk makes Tesla shares rise
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". Demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to bring cars to the clientele quickly, and Tesla has to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla shares went out of trade with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased for nearly four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered more than 95'000 cars and thus reached its current best value.
Musk needs records to reach its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit figures have to be produced in the current and upcoming quarter year. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is needed, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Will British government handle Brexit law? Johnson holding back
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the law last adopted by Parliament against an irregular Brexit. On a question he simply said on Friday before journalists that his government will comply with applicable law.
The law provides that the government must apply for a postponement of the date of withdrawal should not have reached an agreement with the EU until the middle of October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" which makes the negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to bypass the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that would remove the entry into force of the law from the time of the EU exit.
Johnson said he would insist on a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is by agreement".
Iran seems to be driving high uranium enrichment
Iran’s President Hassan Rohani has increased the pressure on the European Contracting Parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. “Unfortunately, the European states show inability or lack of willingness to take concrete action,” said Rohani at a press conference on the margins of the UN Assembly in New York on Thursday. In case they did not agree to their promise, he called for “further steps” from the agreements of the laboriously negotiated 2015 agreement.
Background is the conflict around the international agreement to prevent Iranian nuclear bombs, which, in return, contained the commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the United States went out of the agreement alone to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to a course change in the Middle East policy considered aggressive. The government of President Donald Trump intends to negotiate a new agreement with tougher requirements and has since returned to harsh sanctions against Tehran. Iran finally responded with a resurgence of the uranium enrichment limited in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic now uses the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September or at least prepared for use. According to IAEA specifications, Iran also prepares the construction of more than 300 further centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans would not be willing to carry their part of the deal and would therefore leave the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of US sanctions, suspected Rohani. However, there would still be further discussions that hopefully broke a solution.
Rohani continues to argue Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday's US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran in Yemen had become known about the attack, which the US considered to be false confession. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who claim such accusations must provide proof of this," Rohani said. However, the European leaders in the talks with him during the UN general debate could not have known. Instead, they would only have called for the rebels in Yemen to be unable to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Prior to possible discussions with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions imposed by the U.S. administration had to be lifted, Rohani demanded that the government in Washington be relocated to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet from other stars crossed solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This has been achieved before. The comet allows conclusions on other solar systems.
What was initially only a presumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crossed through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized after his discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has awakened the interest of astronomers around the world.
The far-reaching comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres in diameter. Observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is the second interstellar object after 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 which was seen during a passing through of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get from close by insights into a foreign solar system before he disappears on nomer's return. First observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canarys. "The current speed of the comet is high, approximately 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is at this distance well above the typical speeds of objects surrounding the sun," reports Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency Nasa in a communication.
According to the comet, the analysis is on the way that leads him out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of heavenly bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, who was initially led under the catalog number C/2019 Q4, was named 2I/Borisov, the first part of the name pointing out that it was the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in the approach. For example, researchers will remain many months for investigations. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
Several observatories have already taken visitors to the visor. Thus, a team around Karen Meech from Hawaii University, which had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, in a first investigation, determined the diameter of the celestial object on 2 to 16 kilometers. Recordings of the Gemini Observatory on Hawaii show a clear tail of comet.
Researchers at the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles comets of our solar system, and that points out that its composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes to our, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests, according to IAU's assessment, that these objects could open a new way to research certain processes in other solar systems. However, how often such trick-visites are still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors might be able to catch a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
The agency intends to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (e.g. comet-catter) at a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres from Earth by 2028. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it is intended to listen either to an unspoiled, fresh comet from our own solar system, or to an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it is so far: On the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines is landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are to be made each year at the new airport, and in 2025 it will be 72 million already. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-priced project. China’s latest prestige project is also called "Seastern" because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways and runways, which are later to be extended to seven and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-new metro transports passengers in just 20 minutes to downtown Beijing.
The Chinese had already been able to learn from Beijing several times during construction. The opening of the German capital airport, which has been in construction since 2006, has been postponed. In Beijing, on the other hand, after four years, a first passenger machine had landed.
New overboard aircraft is scheduled to fly 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - of which the UK Space Agency is dreaming of. It may be that, for the 2030 flight surveyed, a special drive in excess (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US station CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely achieve this," said Agency chief Graham Turnock to the station. "We speak of the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
In order to drive the project forward, the British space agency wants to work closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. The Concorde covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to the end of 2003 and needed three to three and a half hours. In 2000, an accident occurred at the launch of a Concorde at the Charles de Gaulle Paris Airport, where all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop an over-slaughter together with the US spacecraft, the "X-Plane". Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the programme.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft could also be used outside the earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "neighbourliest generation truly reusable rammable vehicles".
Turret in Washington: Trump wants to track anonymous tipper in Ukraine-Affair
In the Ukraine affair for the potential abuse of power of the US President Donald Trump wants to detect possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the Whistleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday before employees of the U.S. Embassy at the United Nations in New York. The affected person was almost "a spy" and in the past one had been treated "a little different" than today.
This was considered to be an intimidation attempt against tippers. The event was not actually public. However, several US media spread audio media on Friday from the address. Democrats responded indignantly to the President's statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives had announced on Tuesday preparations for an official theft proceedings against Trump. Their accusations were based mainly on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence staff member who raised heavy accusations against Trump and its central government. At great public pressure, the signs of the notifier had been made on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government staff, according to which the US President "uses the power of his office" to achieve that another country is interfering in favor of the US election 2020.
At the heart of the accusations is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate who could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about former business of Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his spasman from the Ukrainian justice. Biden is in the race for the democratic presidential candidate for the election of 2020.
The Whistleblower accused the White House with a view to the Ukraine telephony as well of the cover: Leading government workers would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic text protocol had been prepared. This was removed from a database normally provided for by the White House after the conversation with lawyers, but instead were stored in a particularly protected system. So far, only a rough discussion protocol has been published.
The identity of the notifier is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it was intended to be an employee of the International Secret Service CIA.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the so-called Whistleblower had spread information from second hand that had turned out to be inappropriate. Therefore, there may not be any tipper or spies at all.
As Trump expressed himself in New York about those who were supposed to have provided information to the Whistleblower, however, outrage arose. The president of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, replied alarmed and complained, Trump's statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, several investigations against Trump and its environment have been taking place in various committees for months. In view of Ukraine’s proposals, the Democrats are now carrying out investigations with new force to launch a possible process of debauchery against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a timetable for our investigation," said the chief of the Secret Service Committee at the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked the ship with a sharp grip, accused him of misrepresenting the things and again called for the resignation of the Chairman of the Committee. Trump regularly insulted ship and had demanded its withdrawal already months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy spheres, working mostly under democratic, but also under Republican presidents, were in a statement published on Friday, behind the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible process of official dissent. If the accusations were true, the "scrupulous abuse of power" by Trump was expressed in it.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could work on a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual deed of office fell in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for success of such a procedure are low. So far, no US president has been abducted by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Operating Council: Jobs are being reduced "scarfing"
The plans of the VW brand, in which production continues to reduce costs, could be borne by manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is being implemented by the works council of the car builder. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by two billion euros by 2023, of which 500 million euros will be saved this year.
The "future pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany by 2020 alone. The basic principle is that a job can only be removed from the car builder if it is demonstrated that the activities connected with it are no longer necessary. Employment insurance is also valid until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from works councils, however, jobs in production, which were not actually a disposition, "scarfing" are being reduced by another way - thus passing the official course. Thus, free-coming regular posts would often not be replaced again.
In these cases, the works council has no way of forcing re-placement. Meanwhile, in many places, staff are failing to condensing work, concerns about the gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants would be greater. In this way, the fear that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. VW said only: "A change in the volume of employment is done socially along the demographic curve as agreed".
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more around the world and control new projects centrally. This will also reduce costs and accelerate decisions – behind it is the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. Head of Production Andreas Tostmann said at a Berlin manager conference: "Insecure times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-resistant."
On this path, there are already successes: for example, this year since 2013, production costs per vehicle would fall in comparison to the previous year. Before journalists said that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, would be reduced by 1.1 hours. The exact figures on the production time VW does not mention, according to our newspaper information, it is at Golf 7 rounds.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. Braunschweig and Salzgitter finished components. For Wolfsburg, VW-internal is the rule that 800,000 cars have to be built every year, so that the plant is profitable. In 2018 the load in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - due to the sinking diesel demand and the problems in changing to the new WLTP fuel and exhaust gas testing process.
However, as production director Tostmann announced last year, a million cars will roll off the band in Wolfsburg. This is intended to make possible the pooling of the golf production in the main plant – because the Zwickau plant will deliver the golf production through the conversion to the location for e-car production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan last declined. Therefore, the expectations now rest on the Gulf 8. Despite all efforts to build the E-Mobility, it is intended to remain the Wolfsburger's bread and butter car.
With Voodoo forced to prostitution: traffickers condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been killed, thrown into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six suspected traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected Nigerian traffickers have been sentenced to prison sentences of up to eight years and three months on Friday in Bochum. The defendants had beaten young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution. In order to enforce their obedience, the expatriate Nigerians had to leave a ritual trouble in their homeland before a Voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years of age. They were brought into sleepboats with the help of Libyan lockers over the Mediterranean. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. In Germany, they arrived on different brothels to work the alleged locker costs of an average of 25 000 euros. Therefore, the wage was completely reduced to them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the inclusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians on brothelle in the trial. "The work made the women difficult to create physically and psychologically," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict announcement. "Some people were answered correctly."
The judgments are based on commercial and tire-based inclusions of foreigners, human trafficking, objectivity and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm permanent dispute with the Lufthansa Group has once again threatened the Ufo flight association with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union "will inform about the labour struggle measures in the LH Group on 14 October," said Ufo Sub-Chairman Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with the Ufo for months. This is also about whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, after a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court, Ufo now sees itself strengthened. Lufthansa wanted to find that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the appeal against them. "That a second court sees the matter completely different, I consider it unlikely," said Ufo Chief Executive Officer Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application to the Frankfurt Federal Labour Court to review the status of Ufo as a trade union. The company argues that the trade union has not used a representative board for months and is thus unable to fill out its role as a collective partner.
In the course of which many members of the Board of Directors and the Advisory Board have resigned, including long-standing union leader Nicole Baublis. Due to the doubts about their leadership, the Ufo had already suspended an original vote on strikes by the cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July.
Easy entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet. But that is to change now. The country at the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the tourism commission informed the number of international and local visitors to 100 million a year.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is a one-historic moment for our country," said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
So far Saudi Arabia is difficult to access for tourists. Visa are usually only available for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state forgiveness. With the new rules, the ore conservativeKingdom hopes more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own assessment, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trading.
In mid-September several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in the east of Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. In the future, national oil production broke dramatically, the oil prices shots up. It should take several weeks until the Kingdom’s oil production again reached its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding feast. On Thursday (local time) the model posted several party photos in their Instagram stories, on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a boy's birthday holiday in Los Angeles according to the People's magazine.
Justin posted several colorful suits on Instagram, including bananas, and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the promi-pair wants to get married at church next weekend.
A year ago, the beekeepers gave themselves to the yes word in a New York stand office. There was no larger festival at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that the two would have found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in the event of plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people died in the crash of a small plane in the West of the Czech Republic. The wreck had been discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metschin), the police reported. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had sent an emergency signal via GPS. The search was also carried out by a military helicopter. The accident insurance case still has to be determined. The crash type is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (plzen) and 100 kilometres northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European species of trees are at risk of extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, non-sustainable logging and the growth of cities are causes of the threat, the World Nature Conservation Union IUCN reported in Brussels on Friday. It has investigated the stocks of all 454 species known in Europe. 265 of which do not occur on any other continent. 58 percent of these 265 are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "hazarded", "strongly endangered", "thoroughly endangered" and "deathed in nature" to "deathed out". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as endangered.
Eberian and Wild Rosskastania Threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) was threatened, one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for the wild Rosskastania. They have been regarded as "hazardous" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The largest threat, alongside a mushroom, is the Balkan Minier Motte. It has spread over the continent since the 1980s from southeastern Europe and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Rosskastania (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 specimens. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and greens.
Shrubs and moose are also in danger.
The IUCN scientists simultaneously created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and moose. More than one-fifth of molluscs and moose and nearly half of all shrub species were threatened, according to IUCN. This was mainly due to the destruction of the wild, to the infested species, agricultural practices and climate change. Lids like snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the Europa Bureau. "We need to limit the effects of man on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 Reported injured
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. According to the information, the dead did not exist. dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Octay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. Since the earthquake on the day before, there have been nearly 200 after-quakes. The earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the millions of metropolises.
Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. In the last 20 years, Turkey has not been prepared enough for tremors, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly endangered. Under the Marmara Sea there is a section of the so-called North Anatolic Disorder, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth Plate.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the strength 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, an earthquake of strength had shaken the region around Istanbul, and the authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira appear in the half-time show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will present the mid-term show of the next American football finals Super Bowl. That’s what the singers announced on Twitter. "Größer won’t do it", Shakira wrote to a photo of himself and Lopez. She’s so excited about standing on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be so far in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said that since 1996 she has dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl - then she saw Diana Ross flying in the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's even special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She can hardly wait to "show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world."
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honored to stand next to another artist on one of the biggest stages worldwide and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "king women" were standing on a stage together.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling viewer numbers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most popular TV broadcasts in the United States. Even if you’ve sunk last: In this February, the spectacle in the United States attracted the least viewers for more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still almost a hundred million people on average.
In the run-up to the mid-term show of the last Super Bowl, there had been a stir: In the fight for the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, media reports said top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear. Finally, the Maroon 5 pop group led the semi-time show - the reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had gone to the knees in the 2016/17 NFL games in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest Kaepernick solved a movement, and numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, U.S. President Donald Trump attacked the mostly African-American football stars. Kaepernick himself has been united since March 2017 and has no more NFL-party. He proposes not to hire the clubs for political reasons.
Cook Guide: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, some banks are likely to be expensive to meet the travel provider’s pleasent Thomas Cook. There are high depreciations on outstanding bonds and loans. The Credit Suisse is also affected by this, writes the "Financial Times" in their Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to write down a total of up to 1.8 billion UK pounds (about 2 billion euros) on their books, according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase depreciations from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the lenders between 550 and 825 million pounds. The actual amounts are expected to be at the top of the bandwidths, said an expert to the sheet.
The extent to which the creditors’ losses will be at the end will show up after the insolvency proceedings. One of the persons surrounding this procedure did not spread too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 aircraft from Thomas Cook in the UK were "old" and many of the real estate were in poor places. Most of the money could be obtained by selling the airport slots as well as the Thomas Cook brand, it continued.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
Seawatch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who were supposed to torture and kill people in Libya. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not have any secure information about it," said the spokesman of the refugee organisation Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They were accused of rape, torture and murdering people in Libya. The suspected perpetrators had been arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who had them on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June, ramming a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects will also have arrived there. There will be investigations against the captain due to aid for illegal immigration.
USA warn Federal Government of Huawei
The head of the US Internet Agency Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network upgrader Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too large," said Pai to the Handelsblatt, looking at the construction of the new 5G mobile radio network.
China has a "national security law", which obliges each company to follow instructions from the security bodies "under Chinese case law".
Furthermore, the applicable law prohibits the company from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC Chief continued. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to demand a "confidence declaration" from suppliers.
At first, Berlin wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology does not consist only of hardware:
Just the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," said Pai.
It was "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "everywhere, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC chief continued.
He makes close contact with the Chinese state apparatus to the Huawei group:
The property relations are opaque. The employee company, which is said to belong to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai the "Handelsblatt".
The U.S. submitted evidence that government staff were placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to recruit for the position of the United States.
Chemicals factory in northern France burns: schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A huge fire wall illuminates the sky above a northern French chemical factory. The fire is erased after hours - the cleaning work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and children's corps remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities the facilities would not be opened with care on Friday, the competent prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to suspend the smoke. There was no injury. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to stop the harvest first.
The fire could be completely erased on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There was still the risk that smell spread after the erasure, so the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 fire fighters and 90 police and gendarms were in use.
A huge black smoke column had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizol factory, which repairs additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometres from the city centre.
According to authorities, the Normandie factory belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites that are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso near Milan in 1976, a devastating chemical accident had occurred.
The prefect of the Normandie region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news station BFMTV that at first it had not been detected "high toxicity" in samples. However, a pollution of the nearby being could not be excluded. In the river dams against pollution had been built up, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out at around 02.40 a.m. on the early morning, the authorities reported that the cause was not clear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to increase its investment to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany must invest now, the earlier the better," said Le Maire on Thursday evening when the French budget presented for the coming year.
The eurozone's economy was weak, the Minister warned.
We must not wait for the economic situation to worsen in order to make the necessary decisions".
Among other things, Le Maire said that those states that had budget room for more investments would have to act with a view to Germany.
France did not have these scopes, the Minister added and referred to the high national debt of its country, which is more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. The French state debt had to be "stabilised" and "stained", said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly called on Germany to make more public investments in order to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly asked France to deal with its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax reliefs of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government thus responds, among other things, to the protests of the Yellowwest movement. The new debt is supposed to fall to 2.2 percent, after expected 3.1 percent this year.
Does he still try to trick?: Johnson turns out a question about Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the "capitalisation law" passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos-brexite. Critics, however, fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, the Tory politician avoids this possibility.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he wants to enforce an irregular Brexit - despite the law last passed by Parliament, which should prevent exactly that. Johnson simply said to journalists that his government would comply with applicable law.
The law provides that the government must apply for a postponement of the date of withdrawal should not have reached an agreement with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to bypass the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that would remove the entry into force of the law after the EU exit. Johnson said that he would insist on a contract with the European Union. "We are confident that the EU will leave on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Johnson's chief advisor Dominic Cummings stated, however, that he felt the political disputes about Brexit as a "spice in the park" and was confident that the target EU exit was yet to come: "We are enjoying this, we are going to win, we are going to leave (not to mention: the EU) no worries," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" at a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the 2016 election campaign, is now a chief strategist in the British government seat Downing Street. He is supposed to be behind the irresponsible policy that led the Premier into a far-off situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) is deeply embedded in the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 to Linda’s death in 1998, was obviously proud and touched when he presented the image book "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrious guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-Frontfraus Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting look at the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration for the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found her photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of polaroids have done it, a few hundred of them are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries" for the first time.
They are portraits, still life, landscapes, several Hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s until the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments", writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course one is always at the center: your husband Paul - how you may never have seen him.
As he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, calls in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboats. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the spotlight light on her farm in southern England or Scotland also led a very normal life. Thus, according to BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had painted from old potato boxes. And it has not always been cleaned up with the McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the Polorid camera starts the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It's about the decision-making click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens before you. And then you have to cut it at exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "You know, two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift always to catch the right moment. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in the Eshun essay.
There's the light, the composition, the cut-out and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but besides all anecdotals is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes also seem like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the Beatles album "Abbey Road", which was recently released just 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to import oil and gas from neighbouring countries. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a Friday interview that Turkey cannot cancel the oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems with the import of Iranian oil, as some companies had withdrawn "because of the US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran in particular on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its exit from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear programme and is not sticking to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably.
US government wants to limit reception of refugees
The U.S. government wants to dramatically limit the reception of refugees. The US Foreign Ministry stated on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be reduced from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which corresponds to a 40 percent cut-off.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that while the US would continue to be obliged to support refugees, it was important, however, to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overburdened.
The US government intends to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thereby at risk, as the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs states. Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, are to take up maximum 1500 refugees.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UN camps are selected and relocated in the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Already the current limit of 30,000 is a lowest. When the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House left, the figure was about 85,000.
Aid organizations responded horribly to the announced reduction of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would thus continue to damage its leading role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration into the US - legally and illegally - and the US government expects, according to its own data, 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Come close to a lacel"
U.S. President Donald Trump has given a witness in the Whistleblower affair of espionage. Anyone who has given him power abuse information "comes close to a tip," Trump said according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. This tells several U.S. media matching.
So, Trump spoke before employees of the U.N. mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistle-blower about controversial operations in the White House, he replied: "It's close to a tipper." Then Trump added: "Do you know what we did in old times than we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now."
The last observation was made by the observers about a possible reference to the death penalty. The democrats were critical of Trump’s statements and were intimidating him with witnesses. Furthermore, it was an attempt to hinder a conference investigation into a possible official theorem proceedings against him, the chairman of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervision in the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower submits to the President in a now published complaint that he has abused his office in order to request an intervention from another country into the US election in 2020. In concrete terms, among other things, his controversial telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyj in summer: In the conversation Trump advised him to launch investigations against his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump contests any misbehavior.
It is still unclear who is both the Whistleblower and its informants. However, as reported in the New York Times, the Whistleblower is to be an analyst of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat known: baby and small children drowned in Aegean
Time and again people try to get across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. The often too small boats were known on a regular basis. Seven migrants were killed during the fall of a boat – five of them children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed during the fall of a boat. Among the deaths were also a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were thus saved from the floods of the occupation of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also a locker, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken out of Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly to small boats. Last year, according to the UNHCR refugee aid work, 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who Breaks Concert
A U.S. concert of the rock band The Who has found a young end because of the impassability of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the show on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to serve. In the eighth song Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it while it's still running."
Lead-Gitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey could "not speak now". Townsend promised the audience to get to its expense at a re-reparation concert. However, an appointment is not yet established.
For Fridays in Dallas and for Sundays in Denver, The Who said they were to be recovered at a later stage. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rent suddenly set: WeWork lets real estate markets sit down
In New York, WeWork has risen to the largest office hirer.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from its small startup to its driving force on the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Owners must fear billions of income.
The crisis of the office rental company WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance on the largest real estate markets in the world. The company had just set off founder Adam Neumann as the boss, postponed the planned stock market and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the executives in order to gain financial space for the coming weeks and months. Furthermore, the British "Financial Times", WeWork reports on the conclusion of new leases with immediate effect. Thus, among other things, the largest rental of office space in New York and London is suddenly out of the market.
WeWork rents large office areas in the long term and rents them in sometimes small units to members. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. Up until now, we are burning money with this business at a breathtaking speed. Last year, the company entered a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the renting costs through renting are expected to rise to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit the loss, the new management of the company will now have stopped the emergency brake and the renting of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the "Financial Times", WeWork has now concluded rental contracts with maturitys of up to 15 years, resulting from commitments of more than 40 billion dollars. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork hired in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months, nearly 300,000 square meters of office space. Alpert’s new contracts ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new sites on the market at that time. Without WeWork’s expansion, the office gap in the US metropolis would have increased during this time, as Alpert wrote in the Business Insider. Similarly, in London, where we work now operates several dozen office locations in the best position.
Also in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could be felt without any further expansion of aggressive startups. Among other things, WeWork is the main renter, in a office house purchased last year by the savings bank fund provider Deca for nearly 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many owners have converted their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners would probably have to write off part of the hoped-for billion incomes. Access to the – in any case scarce – reserves of WeWork do not have them despite the long-term leases. Because renting the individual locations of WeWork is usually done by extra-established subsidiaries, so-called special purpose vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable in narrow limits.
Russia again captured numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard again went against North Korean fishermen. In the last few days, a total of 262 wilderers had been arrested who had been illegally fishing in the waters, according to the Russian Home Office FSB, the agency Interfax announced on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Before that, the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injured, it was called Communist North Korea, suffering from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore traveling in Russian territorial waters. There, the Russian Coast Guard runs patrols according to their own data on the protection of their marine biological resources. During the re-checks, 30,000 squid were discovered. Furthermore, the data were seized after three fishing boats and two motor boats and brought to Naodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Novosibirsk, the 2018 Coast Guard established more than 8,000 infringements.
The Russian fishing authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans after complaints by local entrepreneurs. According to media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, also complained recently about high ecological damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow synthetic nets banned in Russia. With them also small creatures would be taken out of the sea. Furthermore, the networks would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be broken down. Also, the ships themselves do not comply with the hygiene and technical regulations.
According to Moscow’s previous week’s arrests, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured. According to the FSB, a wounded North Korean died later from his injuries. On 17 September, Russian border guards first established a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened fire.
USA imposes ban on entry against former President Castro
The U.S. has imposed bans on entry by former Cuban president Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs founded this in a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in "grove human rights abuses". As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he is in favour of a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of Fidel Castro, who died, was also accused of human rights violations there by the support of President Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard for human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime in order to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," weaved American foreign minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had issued a ban on entry, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, for months, there has been a bitter war of power between the government and the opposition. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him into the knees and to help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of the narrowest allies of Maduros. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the US and Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government in suppressing government opponents.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go on the road again for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is planning further actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. The beginning is due to the time shift in New Zealand and Australia before the protests move across Europe to North America. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large rally in the Canadian Montreal.
How great the worldwide commitment will be this Friday after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday over four million people have been fighting for the climate. This Friday we are doing it again!" she wrote on Twitter. Up until now, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
A good third of all worldwide demonstrators - approximately 1.4 million - were involved in protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates by Fridays for Future. This time, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland.
In August 2018 at the age of 15 Thunberg had taken up the Swedish Parliament to ask its country's politicians to make greater use of climate protection. This led to the Fridays-for-future movement within a short time. The climate protests mainly involve students and students, but increasingly scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate catastrophe. In particular, under the Paris climate agreement, global warming needs to be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Just a month ago, after a two-week transatlantic tower, Thunberg had arrived in New York with a high-sea race yacht. She had recently participated in United Nations climate protests and summits. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she discussed the heads of state and government of the earth with a strong conscience. In her home Stockholm, she had been promised on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection of the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation.
Russia forbids smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony. This is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman from the Ministry of Emergency Affairs on Thursday in Moscow of the agency Tass. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.
Those who smoke nevertheless must expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42,46 euros). If the cigarette should light up a fire, the penalty will fall higher. According to the Ministry, the same prohibition will apply to burning candles. Also to grill meats on the balcony is no longer permitted.
Hit against cybercriminals - Mediation lifts servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time raised a large server provider for illegal transactions in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected to have hosted numerous websites on the Mosel via the internationally active criminals in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Trarbach.
This was reported by the General Public Prosecutors in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening during a major action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects should have been, among other things, the operators of the world’s second-largest Darknet Market for drugs, “Wall Street Market”, had broken down the investigators in the spring. Also, the attack on 1.25 million Telekom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled via a server in Cyberbunker, according to the General Public Procuratorate.
Such a hoster had been raised in Germany for the first time. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the access operation with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It has been the result of nearly five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about more details.
New global climate protests of Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests so far, several thousand people now want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large-scale rally in Montreal.
Climate Protests  in fact Who are Thunberg's Hintermanns?
Righteousness and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more amazing is the fact that a 16-year-old girl keeps the manpower of this time the mirror in front of the nose. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or smart marketing of a climate activist? Historical master performance or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg moves the masses and brings young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person is able to win for himself a collection of children and young people. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has been selected to work for a more just world. At that time, he has also been able to win a host of young people for himself and to persuade them to cross the sea in order to reach the praised country, similar to Greta Thunberg has recently made his way to America with a sailboat.
But is there a shadow side to this? Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. Besides, her mother has published a book that has sold far enough, thanks to the daughter who is in the ramplight. Also well-proved followers of Greta Thunberg were a little dissatisfied about the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably too thick. This is also not unfounded because the action came into the media very well and there is a lot of money coming from the impressive action.
Here, the spirits now separate: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially in the rescuing of the world? Is it even more authentic when certain circles of people work together with stock exchange agents during the world rescue action? No matter what position is ultimately addressed, a critical and reflected point of view is always more important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can certainly make sense to critically question outright projects of certain trendnets.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crossed through our solar system
A strange comet is now crossing our solar system.
The assumptions of astronomers have confirmed themselves: A foreign comet is now crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Lange the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and is currently engaged in astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet has been discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The above-mentioned body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in Crimea. He looked with a self-built telescope to heaven and further follow-up confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of his kind that was seen when passing through.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get out of the vicinity insights into a foreign solar system. Obviously, the comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), comet is clearly interstellar and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbolic track that takes it out of our system.
Comet has been seen before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far away, astronomers can observe it in depth. In contrast to its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be investigated from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US space authority Nasa. "After that, it will only be seen with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings on Comet 2I/Borisov awaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets, because as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could be formed by similar processes as in our, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, observation goes beyond individual knowledge. If two such objects have already been discovered within just two years, a new way of investigating certain processes in other solar systems may be possible.
Again and again asteroids employ the researchers. Only recently a giant asteroid ran past the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely Deprived": Rachel Johnson horrified about brother
For Boris Johnson, it becomes more lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister has tossed with clear words the prime minister's military language as "tasteless". It's not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to equip - at least verbally. At Question Time in the Unterhaus on this Wednesday, this was a massive outrage of the opposition, and in the meantime further critics have reported themselves: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author said to the channel Sky News, her brother uses words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be " hanged, long-term, four-parted, collided and feathered". They consider this to be grossly recognizable. They did not recognize the version of her brother again, said Rachel Johnson, who had joined the EU Parliament in the elections for the anti-Brext Party "Change UK".
In particular, she insisted that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly underhouse member who had been murdered by a Neonazi a few days before the departure referendum in 2016. It was best to honor her memory by going through Brexit that Boris Johnson had said in the underhouse. "It is very tasteless to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," now criticised Johnson's sister. The perpetrator had obviously come from the far-right camp that felt "affirmed by this kind of language." For all who mourned them, it was very tasteless.
The widower of Cox criticised the Prime Minister too. "It makes me sick when Jos Name is used that way," he wrote. The best way to honor her is if you are passionate and determined to stand up for what you think is the same, but never should you "demoneize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had emerged, in which attacks had become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had settled his office as a state secretary and his mandate as a Tory member. "I've been torn between loyalty to the family and the national interest in recent months - it's an insoluble tension," said Jo Johnson.
Johnson’s language was also critical in the Church. As the “Times” reported, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticise the language that “this country is not worthy”. In a joint statement they stated: “In the past days, the language has not been acceptable, both in debates and outside Parliament. We should speak respectfully with respect.”
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez appear at the Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong sign in the year of its 100th anniversary: In the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl two women perform with Latino worms. The promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-Power at Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-time show at the upcoming finale of the US football league NFL, which the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community next to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the USA," Shakira said in a video.
The finale of the American football league, which celebrates its 100th birthday in the coming year, will take place in Miami on February 2. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is a purito-rican origin.
"I love the Super Bowl putting two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez said. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had moved from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later also published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is shown in German cinemas in the drama "Hustlers" starting in November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a Telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whereever, Whereever".
The announcement of half-time guests in the United States is expected to be with tension every time. This year many also consider the choice as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least through the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest U.S. sports event and at the same time a huge advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones provided for furore there. Usually, the NFL final has over 100 million television viewers, and it is also extremely popular in Germany.
Last year, political controversy arose in the run-up to the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to protest against police violence against blacks, and had been severely attacked by US President Donald Trump. Some musicians had refused a super-bowl appearance, including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the Maroon 5 rock group was shown was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and YouTuber uses Egypt's ruler: First of all, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have influenced whether blood flows on the streets of Egypt have spent the past week both abroad. One of the two floated again at Cairo Airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi had spent a pleasant time in New York: U.S. President Donald Trump praised Sisis's approach to political Islam and did not lose a syllable of human rights violations on the Nile in 2013 - in a week when Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the president. He had "no reason for concern", said Sisi at the airport in the microphone of the state television. "The Egyptians don't let themselves be led astray."
Mohamed Ali, in the opinion of the president of the other man, is currently trying to figure out what was happening on the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he lacked the access of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. weeks ago, the 45-year-old as an actor was known only as a minority of the Egyptians. Today he is the tonal voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafes, the living rooms and teaspoons of the country: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's secrets" Ali calls his countrymen to rise up against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president swabs in luxury and let himself build magnificent new palaces, it says. The army leadership on which Sisi is based his rule, Ali casts corruption and enrichment. Because he has been doing business for 15 years in his second occupation as a builder, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least this is the impression of many Egyptians, as the directly exploding clicks show.
After last week's grip had been demonstrated for thousands of years since Sisis's grip on his reign and nearly 2,000 citizens, among them prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "million march" for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would venture into the streets. But there were small protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in the town of Kina near Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests, whose participants Al-Sisi had called for corruption and its departure. In these protests the police also used tear gas and rubber shots. These videos were initially not independently verified.
From the town of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators torn banners with the portrait of the president in pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built up checkpoints in the city and on the exit roads. In Cairo several subway stations were closed due to repair work in the city center, most roads around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011, were blocked. And on the Raba Square, where in 2013, followers of the crashed Muslim Brother Mursi were entangled until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent the dissatisfied gathering: Sisis Future Party wanted to hold a large rally for the president here.
Mohamed Ali prompted these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal must not be the Tahrir Square," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us meet with police officers."But as a retreater, this is not to be understood: "Ganz Egypt is the Tahrir Square".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the internet connection is always much slower than applied by the provider, there are various testing possibilities.
Those who conclude an Internet contract do not need blindly trust the speed information of the providers. Customers can check for themselves how much of this is actually achieved.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a contract component and should therefore be achieved, explains the consumer centre Bavaria.
If the connection is always much slower than applied by the provider, there are different testing possibilities. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them to the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests carried out by the providers are carried out in accordance with provider-specific requirements and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated", the consumer centre Bavaria will give consideration to its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable time limit for the provider, as a rule, of 14 days in order to produce the promised performance.
This does not result in anything even after multiple calls, customers may terminate and may also demand damages. However, if the success persists, only the way of action will help.
First rank Republican for investigation
As the first senior Republican, the Governor of Vermont has spoken out for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here, is determined by the facts found," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the suspension of the President.
Scott said that he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the democratic candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Trump observed that he had been watching bids "for years".
Republicans have so far held back criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have been dismayed for this. Scott’s statements are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has repeatedly opposed Trump’s policy, for example, against the loosening of environmental legislation and the strengthening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man remains in the MCU: Further Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. So Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how it should continue with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". That's why several US media are supposed to be in line with the movie's launch: The film is scheduled to start in the USA from 16 July 2021.
The magazine "Screenrant" quotes Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige as saying: "I am delighted that Spidey's way is being continued in the MCU. Me and all at Marvel-Studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spider-Verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does it come to the sudden good news? Sony Marvel is said to have offered an offer. According to industry magazines, Disney, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate in the revenue of upcoming Spider-Man films with 30 percent. However, the message is not confirmed.
In this way, Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finale
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has now reached the big finale. In the last episode there were many Happy Ends and as many Cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who contributed for many years in the series, was given a charming tribute. Attention, the following sections include spoilers to the serial finale.
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the finale for a final greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some reviews showed again the most memorable scenes with the present-day Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and the successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his suspended imprisonment.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned casually in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) goes straight towards Altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a promising remark as to his suit. Whether he actually threw himself over a walking rock, the consumed Harvey wants to know of the groom, only then snippily to note: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England".
Aegean: Baby and four other children drowned in boat accident
A baby and four other children were drowned at the Kentern of a refugee boat in the Aegean Sea. In total, seven people died in the disaster as reported by the Greek Coast Guard on Friday. The nationalities were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
At present hundreds of migrants from Turkey move to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, according to the UNHCR refugee aid work, 174 people were killed. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that he will visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the relevant EU Commissioner, he wants to "informed himself in Turkey about the situation of refugees," said Seehofer on Friday. Afterwards, he wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help deal with them.
A spokesman from the EU Commission confirmed on Friday the planned journey of Seehofers with EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Minister for Interior Christophe Castaner.
In Greece there are still unusual numbers of migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone 654 people were transferred to the Greek islands, it was called by the Greek Civil Protection Ministry on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The higher figures last raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement in 2016, which provides that the EU can return all refugees and migrants who are illegally coming across Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to take up a Syrian refugee from Turkey for each of the Syrians.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only difficult on the Greek side because of lack of staff. Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos say they are close to 29 400 people, according to the Civil Protection Ministry. The worst is the situation in Lesbos: At present, 5200 migrants are accommodated in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016 had it been so many, reported state broadcasting.

Green politician must be responsible for embarrassing photo pans
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, was manipulated for this reason the cups?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way cup in his hand on a photograph. But now came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained quite unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, has never kept in hand with the reusable coffee cup with metal straw. On the party’s website she was on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had been published before and also distributed to the media - and there was still a schnoder (pap) cup as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green boss has to be responsible for photopanes
The National Post then threw out manipulation and that the Fake News party was producing to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection". And this in the middle of a election campaign for the Unterhaus election, where Trudeau is increasingly hard on account of a bribery scandal.
The photo went virally into the social media and caught up with the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmans to hide their disposable cups."
In order to underline this, she just posted the original: She, in conversation with citizens, put a cup in her hand. However, who, she was right, she was from bamboo. She always had him with her. A party speaker said it was only about hiding the party logo in the picture, and not to cover something. From the photo you can see only a cut out on the website.
May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did that. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to Guardian and at the same time asked herself something about her over-emigrated team: "If they want to work a picture again, then they couldn't do anything with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also been guessed because of their use of one-way plastic or because of travels in shitstorms - but their pictures were not photoshopped. Thus, the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, at the holiday ice with plastic spoons, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifetime flight ban at Cathay
Apparently, Jaqueline Ng had been granted an upgrade by mail from Cathay Pacific. But when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed to fly on board - and she should never fly with Cathay again.
Spontan get an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a change from Economy Class free of charge.
However, this case shows how you should not do it: A self-explained influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram follow Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the way up, the employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, even though they had shown an email in which their Cathay Pacific supposedly had an upgrade in mind. The letter wants the influencer to have received from an airline marketing employee. On the other hand, the airline accuses Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman should have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The staff at JFK Airport were skeptical: they hung up at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from which the mail was supposed to have rejected the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
In her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocatecy, a company representing consumer interests. Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the data of the mail, the case remains clear: Cathay has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. The terms and conditions of the airline also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now activates a lawyer.
Oil prices according to the report on ceasefire in Yemen
The oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday afternoon by more than one dollar. Last time a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The trigger for the course slide was a report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia should have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had caused five percent of the world’s oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels associated with Iran in the civil war country Yemen had claimed the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the U.S. government, is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would defuse the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is to be reached, one could focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Raw materials strategy department at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil prices thus continues its downward movement over the past few days. One week ago, a barrel WTI oil had cost up to nearly $59, Brent nearly $65.
Recently, Bloomberg had called on Insider to report that after the attack in Saudi Arabia, the repair work on oil plants progressed faster than expected in mid-September. Consequently, the amount of production again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there were several press releases calling on insiders, reporting on rapid progress made by the state oil group Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco currently wants to avoid an exchange plan and negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The crew now prepares the departure while the ship is still in front of anchor, Reedereichf Erik Hånell informed Swedish radio on Friday morning in a text message.
However, the U.S. announced that they would move missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia to the Iranian arch enemy. The fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the UK had temporarily raised oil prices in recent weeks.
Desires against Trump tighten up
In the affair for potential abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, covert accusations against the White House have become loud. Several leading government workers have tried intensively to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a disputed telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. This was an anonymous clue. The speaker of the House of Representatives, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, threw forward explicitly "confidence" to the White House. Trump spoke of a "hex hunt".
North Korea considers the third Trump and Kim summit to be in question
North Korea has raised doubts that there will soon be a third summit of power holders Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump in the nuclear dispute. According to the Agency KCNA, the sense and the prospects for success of such a meeting are due to lack of progress in the implementation of agreements at the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday.
The United States had not done anything to implement the decisions of the summit in the previous year, said the consultant to the North Korean Foreign Ministry. He also criticised US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea. However, he hopes for a "wise" and "voluntary" decision of Trump to come back to an approach.
Trump had said Monday that he wanted to know what to bring to Kim's third summit before he agreed to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and rocket program have been on the floor since the failed second Trump and Kim summit in February in Hanoi. In June, both of them met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revitalize the consultations, but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers should help in mine clearance
The British Prince Harry in Angola has symbolically lit and destroyed a mine of explosions. Close to a camp of the British Halo Trust in the city of Dirico, he created the ignition circle. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded. With a view to getting Angola by 2025 mine-free, he later demanded in front of running TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names stand on these weapons, but they did not help to make their way to help."
Pounds under pressure - interest reduction expected
British Pounds Under Pressure
In view of a rapid fall in interest rates, the pound loses value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt Speculations on a rapid downturn in interest rates of the Bank of England (BoE) apply to Sterling Pound. On Friday, the British currency discounted by up to 0.4 percent to $1,2269.
The result of the sales were statements made by the banker Michael Saunders. This brought a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be turned off, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy in the foreseeable future. This statement was surprising as Saunders acted as a champion of a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week the Bank of England had already pointed out the pressures for the economy by the Brexit hack, without directly signaling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson would also want to lead his country out of the EU without divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today's integrity chief of the Light athletic World Association.
At the beginning of the athletics World Cup, new details of the doping scandal in Russia appear - and they destroy the little of credibility that Russian sport had gained at the beginning of the year and also only gradually recovered. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Lab finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: They were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud had been revealed in Russian sport. The Wada had banned the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada) for three years. During this period Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee, after individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, had around 270 athletes in the country under neutral flag, at the winter games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start. They were allowed to join the World Cups in the various sports types, and in summer the football World Cup with the host took place.
Missing positive results
The following September, the Wada raised the Rusada Bann again, but called for access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should include information on the extent to which doping cases are covered at the State Doping. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Light athletic World Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the Doping data has been manipulated from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check if the Task Force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" of Friday. "We have found numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a Whistleblower, and those which it received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings have been mentioned in the McLaren report.
The WM is not affected
This confirms the position of the IAAF: The athletics association is the only organization to hold the banner of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha start 30 Russian athletes under neutral flag. They had to prove that they were training outside the Russian system and carrying out tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already put in space and asked Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the renewed blockage of the Rusada and in the worst case also the exclusion of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
