Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they ‘will be compared to Muppets’
A proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a consequence of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name is ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP ‘is rhyming on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is 'unsatisfied' and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welshe Conservative Party said that his party ‘opens up’ for the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welshe letter W is pronounced as a short you.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently preparing legislation to carry out the change of name, said: 'It is of course the members of the National Assembly of Wales who take the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, members of the National Assembly of Wales were given the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be rebaptised to Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
At present, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have difficulty reaching a consensus in a few weeks' time to present a draft law on change.
The legislation on reforms also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their new title as they debate legislation.
Residents of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the change in the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote to change the name of their country to ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve an insidious dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia’s requests to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum on name change, said that he would not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks Saint Martin's silence, Harlem's have trouble
"The older people I spoke to said that there was a café and a church here at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church."
He said it's understandable that cafés have disappeared.
"People now have social contact in a different way," he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly go by.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds of the sale of the assets of the churches will be less long if the leaders expect, 'and early or late they will be back at the beginning.'
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments where the kind of people would not help in the remaining refuges of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of the people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white," he says, "what will lead these churches to be closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will become members of the church community."
Both churches were once built by a white church congregation, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church community of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church congregation from nearby took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church assembly led by Father John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers in 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was seriously damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Father Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a carillon.
Father David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the beard 'the bells of the poor'.
The expert who played the beard in July referred to the instrument in another way: 'a cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first cardiac in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger cardiac of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the church's lay leaders, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) in July wrote to the diocese to express its concern that the diocese would ‘calculate the costs’ to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in the inauguration of the architects and contractors who had sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-olds who crooked in California
Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who was looking for lobsters in California.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had docked with friends Saturday about half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help. Together with some others, he peddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that the boy called because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized, ‘ I was bitten!
I'm bitten!"
His key leg was completely open,' said Hammel as he approached the boy.
‘I shouted that everyone had to go out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’’.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is said to be at risk of life.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Beach Guard Captain Larry Giles told us in a press conference that a shark had been mocked around a few weeks earlier, but that it had then been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured by the upper body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and security.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break through the British beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and set up beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in large-scale houses.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while selling fashion and household items continues to decline. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 shops throughout the country. If they prove to be a success, they will be introduced into even more shops next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a consequence of the fact that supermarkets want to fill with other products the racks where TVs, microwaves and interior products once stood.
Sainsbury's wants to double his beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also gets more place, with a tableau per brand, such as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique make-up back to the market, since most products are suitable for vegetarians, something younger and younger shoppers are demanding more and more.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first open in Croydon, in the south of London, the second opens later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Because more and more people shop online and buy small amounts of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the shops will look more and more like big store houses, now that the supermarket chain takes it up against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos outlets into hundreds of shops and has also opened up a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have increased.
The last time the supermarket tried to give his departments Beauty and Apotheek a make-over, that became a flop.
Sainsbury's was testing a collaboration with Boots early in 2000, but the cooperation ended when a conflict arose over the distribution of revenue from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacy departments in the shops three years ago for an amount of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan by adding an extensive range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have completely changed the arrangement of our beauty department so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands we offer for every will, and thanks to its attractive surroundings and convenient locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way."
Peter Jones 'enraged' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of Dragons Den's stars, is 'enraged' because TV-presentator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is once compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning's 37-year-old presentatrice announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones van Dragons Den is very upset at Holly Willoughby because she has withdrawn from their profitable lifestyle business at the last moment to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “enraged” when Willoughby announced at a difficult meeting in the company’s main establishment in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that she did not have enough time through her new contracts (with a value of one and a half million pounds) for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company is once compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of an estimated 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: 'Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would ensure its future in the long term and provide sufficient resources for the next decades.
Everyone was amazed when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse in Marlow is full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presentatrice, one of the most profitable stars of Britain, could cost the company millions, as a result of the large investments in products from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now lead to further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been well friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 together with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two sets often go together on vacation and Jones has a share of 40% in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon become brandambassador of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of the program I'm A Celebrity on the British broadcaster ITV.
A source from Jones' entourage said last night: "We have no comment on his business affairs."
Hard language 'and then the love between us'
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media for a comment he made that some people would find “unfit for a president” and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
"I didn't give up anything."
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards the decommissioning of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have taken place.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a ‘agreement’ by the United States after the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States continues its sanctions to keep the pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
"We're doing very well in North Korea," he said.
‘We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have led to positive results, and the missile tests have ended, hostages have been freed and American soldiers have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
"It's as easy to behave as a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, about 200 people would stand here," Trump said, while he was in front of the audience.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island, killing hundreds
In the wake of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population no longer had a home, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for international aid.
'In many cases it is unfortunately clear that they do not apply for international aid, which is difficult for us,' said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, but it is not sure if the outside service providers can work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson of the Agency for Aid to National Disasters, said that Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations were allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still extremely ill prepared for nature's anger.
In Aceh, shelters were built to hide from tsunamis, but along other coasts you rarely see them.
That there was no warning siren for tsunamis present in Palu, even though a warning was in force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Also in ideal conditions it may be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's lack of infrastructure was one of the key points of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the government of President Yoko is facing a shortage of funding, and that while hoping to be re-elected next year.
President Yoko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority today follow a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs fought on the streets, with machetes, arrows, and bows and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool provides impressive equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge prevented Liverpool from losing Chelsea in the Premier League last Saturday, with a goal point in the 89th minute, during a race in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was given a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's purpose, at the time his team stood at 1-0 behind.
He turned left against the ball and then kicked in the direction of the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penitentiary area towards the upper right corner of the net.
He developed the leap of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible,” said Sturridge against LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante approaching and risked an attempt. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked the ball.’
Chelsea was at peace with 1-0, after a target of Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues shot the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed through the civil society to Liverpool's play assistant.
Kovacic did a fast one-two on civil society.
After that, he gave a nice sting, allowing Hazard to reach the penitentiary area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker from Liverpool in the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool plays at 15 o'clock in the team phase of the Champions League against Napoli, in the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will be in London on Thursday at 15 a.m. against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
Tsunami Fatality in Indonesia Up to 832
The death toll of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, said the agency for assistance in national disasters Sunday morning.
Many people were stuck in the ruins of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 from last Friday, where waves also occurred of 6 m high, said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where over 350,000 people live, is full of ruins of collapsed buildings.

The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 at Grayson Mews in John Street. The body showed stab wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of murder.
The police ask the locals to report when they have seen or heard something.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has only just begun, but I want to ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, in particular taxi drivers, to contact them if they may have filmed something through a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential for our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found to be a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon friends who think they know the woman on the spot to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but has been told by the police that no one in or out of the building is allowed.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The inhabitants are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She's just gonna keep repeating: "What a bad thing!"
At 14 o'clock two police cars were in the deposit and a third was just outside.
Within the deposit, a number of agents kept an eye on the apartment building.
If you have any information, please send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or make an anonymous contact with Crimestoppers on the number 0800 555 111, indicating log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'reriting history' rule
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic purite followers.
But the Cromwell Society described the suggestion of Mr. Crick as 'dwaas' and 'an attempt to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: ‘It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the fishing of Oliver Cromwell’s figure just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestors Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that ruled in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure which many believe still have to be recognized.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely correct picture is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict has shaped the further development of our nation in the middle of the 17th century, and Cromwell is an individually identifiable figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognised and remembered."
Murderful pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in the southwest of China, according to reports in the local media.
The man of whom only the surname 'Yuan' is known was found dead at a stable on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His arteries had been drilled and he was under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the intensification of pigs at a pig stable, on 30 May 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was said to have left the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday with his cousin to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and turned a door open to a neighboring pigry.
According to the cousin, a large male pig with blood on its mouth was found in the pig cage.
A forensic investigation showed that the pig killed the farmer of 250 kg, according to the report.
'The legs of my cousin were blooded and maimed', said the cousin with the surname 'Wu', according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
Pictures of surveillance cameras show that Yuan arrived at the market at 4.40 o'clock on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal the man killed wasn't from Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market leaders told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent the other from attacking while the police collected evidence on the spot.
It is said that the Yuan family and market authorities are currently negotiating a compensation for his death.
It happens rarely, but there have been cases of pigs that attack people before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to get seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife pushed the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, an Manitoba farmer at CBC News reported that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can cause aggression.
‘They are just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they're not going to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The tail of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the USA
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weak as she has reached the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday morning at 5 o'clock local time and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trog begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the USA.
Rosa will bring 10 inches [10 cm] of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trog in the coming days will cause widespread rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, waste streams and possibly earth shifts in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain 5 to 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There are sudden floods possible with rapidly worsening conditions, as tropical rain can be very widespread.
It is strongly advised to enter the desert on foot when tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can turn ravines into wild rivers, and storm will produce local windshields and dust.
The approaching trog brings some heavy rain locally to parts of the coastline of southern California.
There is rain of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small waste streams and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region during the rainy season.
Fresh tropical rains will approach Arizona Sunday evening until Monday morning, after which the rain will be spread more at the end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the US can fluctuate strongly, because the North Pole is getting cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the constant summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In a large part of the middle and east of the US, it is expected that October will start hot, with temperatures fluctuating around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York it can become 27 degrees Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees hotter than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the opportunity is high until mid-October at above-average temperatures in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million people looked at the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on one of the six television networks for the appalling testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault reportedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasting interrupted the regular programming for the surprise of Friday: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Justice Commission that she was 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh had affected her and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a witness that he was 100 percent certain that this had not happened.
More than 20,4 million people reported by Nielsen probably looked at Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for the other networks that sent out the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty counting people who watch in an office.
In comparison, that is about like playing-off for a football game or for the Oscar race.
Fox News Channel, which gives all the support to Kavanaugh, had most viewers during the hearing day: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3,1 million viewers, NBC had 2,94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2,89 million viewers, and CNN had 2,52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the cameras of CNN and CBS registered on Friday morning that protesters shouted at him when he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He remained standing down for a few minutes while he was being reviled, live on CNN.
'I'm right here before you,' said one woman.
‘Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
Someone cried, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more at the hearing.
The various channels sent everything out live when the court committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour with that mind that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominated by the next week, something the Democrats would insist on from the minority.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a meeting with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' about Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Premier Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of 'a political game' with the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrives at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit. He said her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's charges was "absurd".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of LSU's death
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and is in prison for suspicion of murder, said Baton Rouge's police.
The authorities made a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses in the crime scene and found the DNA of Simpson on the glasses, reports WAFB, a television station of CBS.
The police asked Simpson and later declared that he had known that he had shot Wayde with death.
His deposit is fixed at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
The coroner of the municipality in East Baton Rouge published a provisional report on Friday stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and local residents all contributed to the investigation that led to arrest.
Sport Director Joe Alleva from LSU thanked local police for his ‘insult and pursuit of justice.’
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 188 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points last season and 2.6 rebounds per match.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team 'capot' and 'in shock' was killed by Waydes.
‘This is an event you always hope it will never happen,’ says Wade.
Volcano spews as in Mexico City
The ashes spouted by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Ramp Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity was picked up in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were registered in 24 hours.
The center detected rumblings and vibrations several times.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ash appeared on authories in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is located at 72 kilometers southeast of the capital. That is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 on the scale of Richter central Mexico was found.
The volcano called 'Don Goyo' has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the birthday vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists successfully hit the riot police, while thousands of participants in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia that broke up the region in two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were held back by the riot police collided the agents with eggs and powder paints, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later on the day, scenes broke out with the police, and the cops pulled up their bat to stop the fights.
For more than an hour pro-independence groups sang: 'Don't forget, do not forgive', while their opponents cried out 'Lang Live Spain'.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they suffered during the protests, reported the local press.
The tensions continue to rise high in the independent-minded region, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters were overwhelmingly voting to become independent, although the rise was low and the people who are against divorce were boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting in the voting agencies in the region, where it came to violent screenings.
Pro-independence groups had camped the Friday night on Saturday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who joined his wife in the separatist protest, said that he was no longer hopeful of Catalonia's prospects for independence.
‘ Last year we experienced one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw how my parents cried for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties achieved an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even if it was nipst, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success, because many of their best-known leaders are absent, either in self-restrained exile or in captivity, awaiting a trial about their role in organizing the referendum and calling for independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been aroused by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are getting higher," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in provisional custody since the end of last year, declared that he is participating in the European Parliament elections next year.
"A candidacy for the European elections is the best way to sue the deterioration of democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was rammed with a car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent around 19:30 a.m. on Thursday.
Police inspector Bob Blemings said the gates and the building had suffered damage themselves.
A crossbow on the car may have been fired at some point.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone brought them victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 matches since he was manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to stand on the same level as Hibernian.
Gerrard’s team failed this season to win a competition during the Premiership. They have to take it Sunday against leader Hearts, who is eight points ahead of them.
But first, the Rangers Rapid Vienna will receive Thursday in the Europe League.
Livingston has remained unscathed in the meantime. The team has already won six rounds in his department, and trainer Holt hasn't had any defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lacks opportunities against strong visitors
Holt's team had long been able to achieve a lead for the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused all kinds of problems in the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who caught Craig Halkett's headball, kicked the ball over the target.
The home team let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances to be calm and confident.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase, and Livingston opened an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scored from the penitentiary area.
At that time, the Rangers had been in possession for quite a while, but the defense of the home crew was incorruptible and goalman Liam Kelly had not had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure to avoid Kelly’s goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball against the feet of Rangers goalman Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a lead by his colleagues from Livingston.
Constantly, livingston's penitentiary was promoted, but they were rejected each time. Twice a penitentiary was refused, one after Halkett's attack on invader Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
Livingston's 'fenominal' analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played excellent without exception and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their play-style and composition of their team has been almost changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves a lot of recognition for the way he has watered up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were running on the tops of their toes throughout the race.
The Rangers, however, were unable to break through.
Even though they have played very well under Gerrard, this time they have not reached their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they managed only once to reduce the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a radiant blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went on Saturday (29 September) together breakfasts in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan left for Cologne for the opening of a giant new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons when she called the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathizers came near to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurden, also made their voice heard, condemning Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him into the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and is accused of others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after car collision
A cyclist died in London in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10.15 hours local time.
The driver stopped the car and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in an accident with flight crime on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that agents were working on identifying the man and informing his immediate family.
The road is closed in several places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: Six Cipiers Injured in Order Disorder
Six civilians were injured in an order disorder in a heavily secure prison for men, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9.30 a.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still going on.
Specialized ‘Tornado’-cipiers have been employed to resolve the situation involving eight prisoners in one department.
The copiers were treated for mild injuries in the face.
A convict spokesman said: ‘A special trained prison staff has been deployed for a current incident in HMP Long Laartin.
Six staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and the responsible are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars for longer.'
In HMP Long Lartin, more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals of the country.
In June, it was reported that the hospital prison director had been treated after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot police were called to prison for a serious disorder in order to attack personnel with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with potentially positive effects for drought areas)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression is reaching Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week. This is because the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa moves across the southwest of the desert region, which brings risks to flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang on Tuesday just above Phoenix. Monday night it will rain already.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that ‘since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.'
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably get 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
The rain of Rosa can be a blessing for areas that are not at risk of flooding, as the region is affected by drought.
While floods are very alarming, part of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the southwest is currently suffering a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are indicated, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona is at least extreme drought, the second highest category,' reportedweather.com.
The line of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland via the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still on hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, located at 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving northward at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm strikes cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, weakening them.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive Monday in the afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm in Mexico.
There may be heavy rain in parts of Mexico, which entails a significant flood risk.
‘A total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ reportedweather.com.
Rosa moves north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona on Tuesday in the early morning as a tropical depression, which will then be late for Tuesday night by Arizona and in the south of Utah.
‘The greatest danger facing Rosa or her tail is very severe rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the desert area’ said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and debris in the deserts and earth’s shifts on mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests for suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured at about 4 o'clock local time in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something of what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'has suffered by the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
'A voice for judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the brutal and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party', Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that, during his appointment procedure, Kavanaugh continued to 'have suffered under the common, the anger' of the Democratic Party
On Thursday, Kavanaugh witnessed to Congress, denying strong and emotional the rise of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford also witnessed her accusation.
The president said on Saturday that the ‘American people saw ‘the wonderful and incredible character, the quality and courage’ of Kavanaugh that day.
‘A voice to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice recognised by one of the most completed legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent status of service,’ he told the crowd advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the mid-term elections.
‘Over five weeks, one of the most important elections is held in our lives.
I don't take part, but actually I'll take part," he said.
'That's why I came up everywhere for great candidates.'
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to "offer resistance and hinder us".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place at the latest on Friday, a top employee of the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people are killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and toll is increasing
At least 384 people were killed in a great earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, with many being swept away from the ground when huge waves crashed on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had met Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of up to six meters high hit land at the time it began to slumber. Many people fell to taste and the waves destroyed everything on their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
‘When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not run away immediately and thus became the victim of the tsunami,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian agency for help in natural disasters BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses with him, he hit everything on the land,' said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people knocked into a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
On aerial photographs released by the natural disasters assistance office, it can be seen that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been distorted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was rocked by aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released during the massive earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long narrow bay, has magnified the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as 'observable' and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
Some fatal victims were stuck under the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, and about 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala ‘is completely flat, we have no information at all’, said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living,” said the Red Cross in a statement. Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to affected areas.
'This is a tragedy now, but it can get much worse,' said the Red Cross.
The organization received much criticism on Saturday because she had not said that a tsunami Palu had hit, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning had been given.
In amateur images shared on social media, you can hear a man on the upper floor of a building panicking down to people on the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast and buildings and cars are swept away.
Reuters could not immediately verify the images.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a major power failure that cut off the communication around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending freight aircraft with aid goods from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacués are still in dire need of food and other basic needs.
The city's airport is re-opened for aid only and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll rises above 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision employees from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees in the courtyard of their office are looking for shelter in tents of deck sail, but pass through scenes of destruction, Doseba said.
'They told me that they saw many houses that were destroyed,' he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups started with the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers could not travel to Palu with great expertise.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, goods and personnel from abroad can only be admitted if the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘O.K., this is a national disaster’, we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.”
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing kept hoping that they would find their loved ones life again, as in the miracles that people like to belong to terrible natural disasters like this.
Saturday a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, relief workers released a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also stuck in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi.
'As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional load,' he said.
Mr. Gendon said that the news that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread in the paragliding community and that he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu during the hours thereafter, who participated in the beach festival.
In his messages, however, only one grey fin appeared instead of two blue fins.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while stocking cash machine in Newport on the Life
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver had just emptied a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, so Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
When he was busy, another man walked behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, according to the press release, but the police did not say how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators is asked to contact the Newport police on the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change on Twitter with the words: ‘The being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
41-year-old West has been named Ye for a while and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her performance during the show for 'emotional reasons', says the artist of the show.
You're not just a abbreviation of his current artist name. Earlier West already told us that the word has a religious meaning for him.
In my opinion, ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,’ West said earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album at radio presenter Big Boy.
‘So I am you, I am us, we are.
I was transferred from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more like a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapist who changes his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has also worked with and without the link sign and capital letters.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against civilians. The country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would use ‘never military violence to suppress the Mexican people.’
On October 2, 1968, military troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements occurred throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening up more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs due to unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
United States must double A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount spent on A.I. research, says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this in response to the announcements on A.I. coming from various departments of the US government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, last year China announced its plan: by 2030, it wanted to be the number 1 in the area of A.I. innovations.
‘The A.I. research budget would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.’, said Lee.
A doubling of funding can lead to a doubling of the chances of the next major achievement for A.I. in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ this month was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in Face++, one of China’s most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated the best player of American Othello, and later became manager of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next match would take place because it would help to discover the next visionaries.
In the US, researchers often have to work hard to obtain government subsidies, said Lee.
‘China does not pick up our best academics, companies do so’ said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited the best forces of universities to work on A.I.
Lee said that US efforts in the field of A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
‘Who is a doctor of A.I. should automatically be offered a green card,’ he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Sciences Foundation provides financial support to employees of academic institutions, like the National Science Foundation and other government organisations, to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center designed to involve industry partners and academics in the initiative, and announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that two billion dollars would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than 100 million dollars in research into A.I.
However, the American legislation that should lead to the establishment of a national safety committee for artificial intelligence has been in the loop for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible country name change
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of the name of their country to ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia’, which would prevent a dispute with Greece that has been advocating for decades and would no longer hinder Greece’s Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province that is also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country claims in Greek territory, and therefore Greece vetoed the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycot campaign is not certain that the required rise of at least 50% will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the vote is as follows: 'Do you support NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?'
‘Deputies of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, find that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that originated when the former Yugoslavia broke up.
‘I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us, said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have indicated that it will respect the outcome, which will determine it.
For the change of name, a second-third would be required in Parliament.
The National Election Commission said that there had been no reports of irregularities at 13 o'clock.
At the time, however, attendance was only 16 percent, compared with 34% during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
‘I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Premier Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018 during the referendum on the name change of the country that would open the way for NATO and the European Union membership.
For Parliament in Skopje 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people who boycott the referendum.
‘We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a rear gate, said Kavadarkov.
‘We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will provide much-needed investments for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I am convinced that the vast majority is in favour, because over 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required attendance.
From another survey conducted by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, it was concluded that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of that would vote yes.
If the referendum is successful, the rise must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came into force in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and Score
Last Saturday Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short measurements with Brighton’s defense at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England. Manchester City won the match with 2.0.
It looked like a whistle of a penny, as Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian summit was first played on civil society.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, right into the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He was able to pass a defender and was too quick for some others on the edge of Brighton's penitentiary.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the criminal field to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right-hand shoe to defeat targetman Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right-hand side of the net.
'Aguero has problems with his feet,' said coach Pep Guardiola from Manchester City to the press.
‘ We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's playing field.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player just tapped the ball right before he was too far.
City takes place on Tuesday at 12.55 C.E. against Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The competition takes place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play and doesn't make it easy for the Rockies to reach the play-off.
Now that the Washington Nationals were eliminated for the playoff, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Nevertheless, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are any consequences for the Rockies' participation in the playoff. They currently have one competition for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least authorized a game-off gamecard thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but they still want to make every effort to ensure their first section title.
‘Although there is nothing left for us, we can at least see with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in that?"
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to set up Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who was going to make his 34th start, stood in the field on Thursday and would still have pitch next Sunday, although that is normally his rest day.
The right-handed thrower of Washington stands on 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organizes meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, talking about the importance of the Republican rise in the mid-term elections.
‘All we have already achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections is held in our lives.
This is one of the really big elections. I don't take part, but in fact I do, so I come all over for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take power back, no matter what they have to do for it.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, were on a mission to "supply resistance and hinder us."
"And we've seen that in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "boss and mean and false and lying."
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is based in the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to a loud cry from the public.
‘ Do you remember what she replied?
Did you select the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
Finally, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour Members who got that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censorship because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues to those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
And so was the case during most of the GC meetings on Friday evening during the eight years I have already been a local Labour parliament member.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today and has long forgotten the promise of a 'feeler, softer' politics, if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a different opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable to the Party's leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader. Collegas who, as far as I knew, had a political view similar to me, suddenly expected me to make a turnaround and take a position that I would never have agreed to, from subjects such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak to a public, whatever I say, there are sluggish parties to social media calling for the rejection of my candidacy as a member of parliament for the next elections, exposing the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to deal with a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that there seems to be serious injury.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and with every 'motion of distrust' or change of selection rules, the party becomes smaller-spirited.
For the past two years, I have often received the advice to keep myself deified, not simply to express my opinion, and then I would ‘not get into trouble’.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago as a schoolchild, promoted by the neglect of the government of Thatcher which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always advocated better public services for those they need most, both in my role as a municipal council member and in my role as minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, nor in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy points and my debates with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact I only have one message, which is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a parliamentarian for the next elections, whether political opportunities will stop me from acting according to what I think is in your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unspoiled Ayr on the way to the top
Two late try's may have scratched the end result somewhat, but there's no doubt that Ayr is rightly triumphant in this wonderful race of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They're at the top of the classification now, the only unscathed team in the ten.
In the end, they were both their superior defense and their better opportunities that the home team provided the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
"We've had a hard time in our games so far, and we're still unbeatable, so I'm a happy man," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: "All honor to Ayr, they have taken advantage of their opportunities better than we do."
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, finished by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but by a yellow map of Rory Hughes from the Scottish national team (which he got during the Warriors competition), Melrose was able to make the figures speak and Jason Baggot managed to break a try.
With a penalty, Clima made an extra advantage for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solotry just before the rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The game was a long time still for a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was taken off on a blancard, and once the game was re-started, Ayr could continue to run through a try by Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then, Ayr's commander Blair Macpherson got a yellow card, and again Melrose dealt with the extra man when no conversion followed a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a race where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he had Climo tock without the ball, MacPherson made the uplifting Ayr mouth for a touch-down at the penalty-line-out.
Clima took care of the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe took the box of David Armstrong and sent halfback Gregor Henry away for the fifth try of the home team.
Ster van Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Actor Ford Kieran is from Still Game at the restaurant. Apparently, he is appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he acts himself together with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last one in the series, and it seems that Kilern is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun showed that Kirann was looking for a way to participate in the 'blossoming restaurant business' in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours: it country-wide Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Sealui patrols in a mechanized marine office in La Paz.
An ocean-blue flag wakes up on public buildings.
On all marine bases of Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto exudes: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
In all the country surrounding Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country had to give after a bloody 19th century commodity conflict to Chile is still alive, just as the desire to revisit the Pacific.
That hope may have reached its highest point in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice, which should be held on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
‘Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the result with positive prospects’, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will look at the ruling of the Court of Justice on large screens, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will plead in the benefit of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of pointed talks, is obliged to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who next year stands for a controversial struggle for re-election, is much at stake in the decision of Monday.
'We are very close to returning to the Pacific,' he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is not likely to decide in the benefit of Bolivia, and even if that were the case, little would change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling falls only six months after the closing petition indicates that the case was ‘not complicated’, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome of Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, in the last four years the situation may have become even worse.
"The case surrounding access to the sea has been cut by the present Bolivian government," Zárate said.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has completely undermined all good will that Chile might have still had, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to talk after that.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other's country since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denied that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile” and a chance to ‘end 139 years of disagreement, with mutual advantages’, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the maritime issue as a political crutch.
‘Bolivia will never give up his right to access to the Pacific,’ he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind us."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to meet the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time that state secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to re-start the fixed nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it's a utopia that the permanent sanctions and the American objection to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever get North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking important steps in the area of disarmament first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, skepticism prevails, and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious when he says that he would refrain from an arsenal that the country probably sees as his only way of ensuring his safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge main covers, soon for sale from you in the area
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, do not seek further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversized head covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were not to think away from Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-blinding creations the catwalk on.
The remarkable piece of Valentino was a giant beige hat decorated with a feathery wide edge, which hung to the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons covered with precious stones, a magic hat and even an pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks, the lips were tightened. They looked more like Hannibal Lecter than on haute coouture.
One creation looked like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you're lucky.
Stijlwatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-metre-wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared on social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in bath suit that took the bag.
The red orange raffia bag, finished with raffia franjes and finished with a white leather lever, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Languages skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives of the whole community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim at providing the best service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects at the very heart of schools.
Nelson Mandela said: ‘ If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English only when we want to build relationships and a bond of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results of this year, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the ranking list, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages scored a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools joined SCIS, shows that 72 percent of students achieved a high score ('A') in Mandarin, while 72 percent of students received German, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as much as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
An investigation by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the obstacles to filling in job vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills thus become increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
More and more jobs require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, when he has learned a second language, in the future he has a real advantage with such a skill for life.
Directly communicating with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person a lead to competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% was unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation. French was the only language that was above 10%, with a total of 15%.
This is why investment in language education is now important to the children of today.
Several languages, in particular those of emerging economies, will offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach themselves.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the United Kingdom when they look ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specialised in this field.
Scottish independent schools work to provide a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
At present it cannot be denied that languages in a global business environment remain vitally important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as 'international communication skills.'
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il sucks bee faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers-Coach Luke Walton announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening competition before the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It still has to be determined how many minutes he'll play.
'It will be more than one, and less than 48,' said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for the Lakers schedule for the six races prior to the season.
'At this stage of my career I don't need any matches before the season to prepare me,' he said.
Period of election rallys of Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, at a long series of election rallys
It is the first of Trump's five planned rallys in the coming week, including stops in places that he has healed, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he chooses for the job in the Supreme Court has been put in place, Trump wants to build support for the forthcoming interim elections, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time does Trump's rally start in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday September 29, 2018, at 19 h.
You can watch Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearings for candidate Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh of this week. These were extra loaded now Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and perhaps the Senate will wait a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallys is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the elections in November to get more lan.
The campaign of President Trump said that these five rallys next week are designed to ‘encourage volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Deputies’, says Reuters.
‘Congress control is so important for its programme, that the President will travel to as many states as possible now the busy campaign season begins’ said a spokesman for the Trump campaign that did not want to be named against Reuters.
The rally of tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tries to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep the hope alive in the run-up to the singles of Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon might have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The fluttering swing of opportunities is a completely invented sports concept, but a true player really believes in it, and especially in competitions like this.
So who currently gets the best chances?
'They first had a leap of six points, and now it's only four more, so we find it's kind of lucky to be on our side right now,' said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of having four points in favour, while 12 are still at stake.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and scored three points of the four.
Spieth has been a too fearsome opponent from tea to green and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when playing well became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial putt with which competition four became a success when he and Thomas left two points after two games.
His well with which they won the game at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the species from which you can deduce that he believes the American team is not yet defeated.
"You have to dig deep and just worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable but wonderful European duo has four at four and can do nothing wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that did not play Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoid Bogey's.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players who must be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will ever be the most popular player to book a European victory when the sun sets above Le Golf National.
If you prefer both at different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backlog for the Spaniard and the Swede that they no longer came up.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help get your back.
The four balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and the way a strategy can change in an eye.
The European team has played the best so far and has a good advantage in the start of the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to fight, something that some, especially in the US, doubt.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four balls and foursomes of Saturday they stand 10-6 in front of the United States.
It was dedicated to Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari who led their team with two wins more than Tiger Woods, who had difficulty, making them now have four points ahead in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, that the trophy she wanted to lose in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the bloating Americans in the four balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two matches, but could no longer catch up with his back.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points during the 12 singles competitions of Sunday to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who got the nickname ‘Molliwood’, after a sensational weekend are only the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup that wins four points in their four opening races.
After they had entered Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls, they were beautifully played on each other and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who swept himself through two games Saturday, occasionally showed a wonderful move, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
Nevertheless, it did not run a leash for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas made the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won a hard match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later defeated Poultry and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch up with four points at the beginning of the singles, although the team of Furyk has enough to play the same, as they currently have the trophy in their hands.
But now that they have been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says it 'in no case' will disarm unilaterally without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions lead to growing distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN Annual General Assembly that North Korea had over the past year hit ‘important goodwill measures’, such as the cessation of nuclear and rocket tests, the decommissioning of the nuclear testing site and the promise not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any corresponding response from the US," he said.
“Unless any confidence in the US will be untrustful of our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way disarm ourselves unilaterally.”
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a 'fashed' approach to denuclearization, where North Korea would be rewarded as far as the further steps are taken, it was apparent that he did not reject the unilateral denuclearization a priori, as Pyongyang used to do.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first summit between an active U.S. President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the ‘denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula’, while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korea war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the "explainment of the end of war," said Ri.
‘The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only strengthen our mistrust.'
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the American leader did bring up with the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: 'If the other party was in this issue of denuclearization South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impasse.'
However, the tone of Ri's speech was considerably different from that of last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on mainland America should be directed after 'Mr Evil President' Trump Kim called a 'raketman' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim this year for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea denucifies.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this: 'Whether it lasts two years, three years or five months, that doesn't matter.'
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
On Thursday, however, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: ‘The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be continued forcefully and firmly until we have achieved the complete, final, verified denuclearization.’
The Security Council has been imposing unanimous sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to greatly reduce the funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Almost a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea accused him of setting 'gangstery demands'.
North Korea promised this month, during a meeting with Moon, to dismantle a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to ‘make similar measures’.
He said that Kim had told him that the 'equivalent measures' he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep in an effort to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor found that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, established the course. As far as he knows, this is unique in the USA.
He got the idea of starting the course after giving a talk about the influence of sleep disability on learning.
'At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I not getting to hear this now, in my last year?'
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
In the course, which is organised for the first time this year, students are explained the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was found that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see a picture of a dormitory room, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise equipment and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep shortages, and the importance of a routine in sleeping.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep is increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
With the help of a campus map, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
‘We know that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we think that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know what impact cigarettes have on their health, Czeisler added to it.
Studying the culture of vigor on a night still exists, he says, and because of modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep shortages are an increasing problem.
Provide sufficient sleep, of good quality, must be the student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep shortage causes the brain to give them a constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czesler to prepare the course, since last year he had been teaching at the professor when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make sure that the course became available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, and not only an alarm to get up. They also need to be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' of electronics screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, which can make you struggle to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to destroy Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their competition again disappointing when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team defeated 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team was hoping for a first victory in a competition since they defeated St Johnny with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team took care of the defeat, almost the second of Gerrard as a manager in 18 matches. His team now has eight points behind Hearts, which are on the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the scorer.
The Rangers now fell to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could have more problems, since border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after apparently an object was thrown to him by the supporters of the visitor team.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, passing Ayr and going to the half finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed with the same 11th for Livingston, who last week managed to cut off the Hearts a point. He would have been delighted by the way his well-trained team was able to block the opponents at each move.
The Rangers may have had the most ball possession, but Livingston was more involved.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga gave off the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the vizier, but the civilian couldn't finish it.
A deep free staircase of Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague-defender Alan Lithgov shot against the back pole.
The Rangers succeeded in taking control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than believe in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found at least that he was entitled to a sentence when he and Steven Lawless collided after a quarter of a year, but referee Steven Thomson waved away the request from the Colombian.
The Rangers could only shoot twice at the finish in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who used to be a targetman at the Ibrox, could easily stop the football of Lassana Coulibaly and the tame shot of Oviedo Ejaria.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may not be in the extension of the overall game, no one can deny that they deserved this, even though it was just about their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers had not been washed against Jacobs' deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool-blooded and chose Menga, who easily stepped the ball into the goal.
Gerrard made a break with the Coulibaly/Ryan Kent range. This move had almost immediate consequences when the wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced off his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play the kind of game Livingston likes to play, where Lithgow and Halkett keep kicking long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final stage of the game, but McGregor stood well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invaders Glenn Middleton from the Rangers requested a sentence at the end of the game after a hit with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the almanac of our Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, exactly 136 years ago today, for whom TELLEN... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device named Geiger counter.
The violin counter has since been unthinkable from science, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in 'Bels or Coronado', a 1950 film with the first sight unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘What the hell is that?’
Rogers: ‘That’s a Geiger counter that is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this headphone, you will hear the effect of the atoms that are released by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: ‘It’s really banging now!’
'Hans' Geiger died in 1945, almost a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.

The method removes immune cells from a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adapted in such a way that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2 that often occurs in various types of cancer. Then the cells are reinjected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and ‘learn’ these cells to tackle cancer cells has been shown to work earlier in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West cuts off pro-Trump-tirade and carries MAGA-pet after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That wasn't the way he hoped.
In a broadcast of Saturday Night Live, Kanye West was published after an onslaught performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he became President's candidate in 2020.
After he brought his third song of the night, Ghost Town, on his head a cap with the text Make America Great Again, he turned off a tyrid against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
‘What if I speak to a white man, he asks, ‘How can you have sympathy for Trump now? He’s a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I'd been out of America for a long time," he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon struck the dragon with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh to the Senate Justice Commission on the alleged assault that Christine Blasey Ford accused him of.
West's tyrid was not broadcast, but comic Chris Rock uploaded them on social media.
It's not clear that Rock with his post wants to strike the dragon with West.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken backstage to fire his cap.
‘They've been fighting me backstage.
They said, "Don't step on stage with that hat."
They've been mad at me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said, according to the Washington examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see how apathetic looks?’ He said that he would attract them superman cape, ‘for that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
At least twice from the audience, SNL's castles seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was told by a present: 'The whole studio was suddenly quiet.'
West was a guest as a last-minute substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it while he was dressed as Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of our bravest spirits: BEDANKT YOU THE MASSA TREATSEERT.’
But talkshow-presentatrice Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just 'normally self, and that's beautiful.'
‘But I choose not to reward someone who supports and spits out an ideology that harms my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
So did we, she added.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, ‘the being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
He is not the first artist to change his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collega-rapper Snoop Dogg has also worn the name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince once changed his name into a symbol and then in The artist forever knew as Prince.
Indictment of attempted murder after stinging at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was sunk down in a restaurant in the east of Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to appear Monday before the police judge in Belfast.
The charge will be examined by the Public Ministry.
Game of Thrones-ster Kit Harington is looking forward to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role of sword fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor brings out to the stereotype of the macho hero and says that when seeing such roles on the screen, young boys often think they have to be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thought that "there has been something wrong" and asked himself how the problem of toxic masculinity should be addressed in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, recently married with his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
'This is an important question for me personally at the moment: where has our masculinity gone wrong?' he said.
"What did we teach men when they grew up, which is what we are facing now?"
Kit thinks that television might be partly responsible for the increase of toxic manhood, due to his very male characters.
He continued: ‘What is innate and what is taught?’
What is taught on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of today's big questions: how do we change it?
For there's obviously something wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequences of Games of Thrones when the series is over next summer, for he is 'dead with battlefields and horses'.
From November, Kit plays in a revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he finds that his encounter with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the series, so that's how I've kept my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was crowned with an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslies family in Scotland.
Hiv/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were passed on via sex, which was not the case before.
Hiv has spread rapidly in some parts of China in the past through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people who are on the rise in this way is now almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV via sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality is no longer punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
According to studies, the conservative values of the country are estimated to marry 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men in the end.
The disease is often transmitted by insufficient protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication in the context of efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denys that staff worker has leaked data from Republican senators and extracted them into 'hazardous lies' and 'complot theory'
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters goes against the accusations that one of her staff staff has posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the accusations are spread by ‘extreme right’ questioners and websites.
‘Lies, lies and even more mean lies’, Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published would include the private address and telephone number of American Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared on Thursday online. They were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Commission on the accusations of sexual misconduct at Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate judge for the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Poundit and RedState, the IP address indicating the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and contained information from a Waters employee, said the Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie."
The Waters Declaration quickly came up with criticism online, including by former press representative of the White House Ari Fleischer.
'This denial sounds evil', written Fleischer.
‘From this you can conclude that she does not have the temperament to be a Congressman.
If someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
He should not rebel.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must stay calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats on Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive evil during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take place in the mid-term elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Frequently, if it is true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement authorities of these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators become known," she said, "and that they are legally held liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff workers."
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new British film we are traditionally looking for references to Brexit, and that is indeed true to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films with a sloppy spy in the leading role, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was created back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy self-absorbing about how bad we do it the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with pitiful eyes and flexible faces manages at least to send everything in the hundred, also with his second comeback. From his name you can already conclude that he is a general comic character that was designed for cinematists in countries where one speaks a different language than English.
Of course, he is the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a little Clauseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a grain of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man who Atkinson once played in the TV spots of Barclaycard (which everyone has forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves behind a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and picks the rotor blades against his helmet.
Atkinson can show well in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough, especially now the "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Imposible self comedy include as ingredient, doing well.
The humor seems more intended for children than for adults, and the stupid disaster of Johnny English comes to me less original and focused than the jokes without the text of the character Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme is that Britain is in serious difficulties.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, which has made the identity of all active secret agents of Britain known, a great horror of the agent in office, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That's the drop that makes the bucket run over from the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems on her head and awfully unpopular as political. Emma Thompson is doing her utmost with this character that reminds Teresa May, but the script doesn't offer much material to work with.
According to her information advisers, she has to use a retired spy, since every active spy is compromised.
And that means the stubbling Johnny English itself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic institution, but unofficially teaches about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the English spys think of School of Rock.
English is quickly released at Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pathetic help Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is captain of an underseat, a turbulent and jovial role that lies under Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are therefore back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's blood-moving femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister unfortunately falls for the charms of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start at their odyssee of clumsy stupid fun: dressed as waiters they set a decent French restaurant in fire, they set kicks aboard Volta's luxury yacht and English releases pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with Volta's home's interior.
For that last thing, all the registers are opened, but however well-intentioned and turbulent the scene is, she reminds us of child television.
It's not all very original.
And just like with the other films of Johnny English, I ask myself the question: can the British film industry not now really think of any role that honors Rowan Atkinson's talent?
Labour denys that the party is considering a plan in which British workers work four days a week, but paid for five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn would consider a radical plan where Britons work four days a week, but paid for five days.
The party is said to want bosses to pass on to their employees the savings they do as a result of the revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) by giving them an extra day holiday.
For example, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn as much.
According to sources, the idea in the economic agenda of the party and the plans to bring the balance of the country into the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Association of Trade Unions, which finds it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-level source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘A policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place from one moment to another, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits within the party's efforts to make the balance sheet in the economy more effective for workers and that is also appropriate within the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in the 2017 National Election Campaign.
However, the aim is not yet supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a policy plan of the party and is also not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the 'sightless drivers' and the 'profiters' at utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not regain the full value of their share, because a Labour government could apply "cuts" based on observed misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in corporate boards and to set up inclusive ownership funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) giving 10% of private sector shares to employees who can earn up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's investigation to Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the FBI's findings could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview broadcast at '60 Minutes' Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI to discover something that could lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said before the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charge came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was steadfast, determined, unquestioning."
However, Graham's voice seems to be wall-resistant.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is fixed and the accusation should contain dynamic," he said.
"As far as Dr. Ford is concerned, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I do not see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival is organized in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will take place and that has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizens Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: ending extreme poverty for 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poetty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting this.
Concerters who wish to obtain a free card for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, a world leader e-mails, telephone calls, or in another significant way to become aware of the goal: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with a further 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call for action or is this just another form of "clickivism", giving people the feeling that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizens, more than 19 million 'actions' of supporters have been registered, targeting a large number of different goals.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the deployment of world leaders and policy proposals worth more than $37 billion to change the lives of 2.25 billion before 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 initiatives and declarations based on the actions, of which at least 10 billion has been paid out or brought together by sponsors.
The group estimates that so far the funds obtained have had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important statements of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of helping children realize their full potential. This group has promised $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national governments and of Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice that is malnutrition, a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, the public during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions had been sent in which the British authorities were asked to improve the nutrition situation for mothers and children, the government announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, that 5 million women and children will reach with food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website of the Global Citizens asking "why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
the group replied: "It will be a long and difficult road, where we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, like civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will ultimately succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are a few of the artists who will perform this year at the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy for a 'blockade' to hinder Russian exports of energy - Minister for Home Affairs
Washington may take refuge 'if necessary' until the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zince, the US Home Affairs Minister, as mentioned by the Washington examiner.
Zince claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country takes place at the invitation of the legal government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the officer, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has that possibility, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them in order to ensure that their energy does not come to the market," he said.
Zince spoke for invited guests during an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without a profit-making purpose that fines itself as the 'vote of energy consumption' in the US.
He went further and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that these differences were not substantial.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels" he said and referred to Russia as a country that has only a 'art', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These declarations come at a time when the Trump government is trying to stimulate exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a country that offers far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, officers from the Trump government, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the 'unfit' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump of Berlin, has made Moscow's 'prisoned'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is only driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers themselves should be able to choose their suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, Russian Minister for Energy, after meeting Rick Perry, the US Minister for Energy, in Moscow in September.
The US position has triggered a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, called on the US not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kemp, head of the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously about it' to participate in the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator said Saturday that she was 'severely thinking about' to take part in the presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about participating in the elections.
"It's time women went to Washington to repair the damaged government, and this also means a woman in the top position," she said, according to the political newsmagazine The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will think seriously about making myself elected as president."
Warren is running against President Donald Trump at the town hall meeting and said that he is "turning this country in the wrong direction."
"I am up to the bone worried about what Donald Trump brings into our democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we have to wait for an FBI investigation before voting on it."
However, an opinion poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own attachment felt that it should not be elected by 2020.
Eighty-eight percent of the 'presumably' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be elected, according to an opinion poll from the Political Research Center of the Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent was for her to be elected.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% before a possible candidateship and 48% against.
Other names of leading Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about the PTSS of Track Palin at an election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after serving in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence on Monday night.
"By what my own son must experience, what he is experiencing when he is back, I understand for other families who suffer the consequences of PTSS and the injuries with which some of our soldiers return," she told the audience who was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and they get harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given to the homeland."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence and attack on a woman, interfering in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington DC and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the US that refuses asylum to victims who are fleeing violence from gangs or from domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and Washington D.C. made a statement last Friday as 'friend-of-the-court' to the Washington court in support of an asylum seeker fighting this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace case versus Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union in August was not disclosed against federal policy.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She's been detained there in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people apply for asylum in the United States, as countries with major problems in terms of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has reversed a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals from 2014, which enabled immigrants to apply for asylum without documents running for domestic violence.
Karl Racine, the procurator general of Washington D.C., said Friday in a statement that the new policy "is ignoring ten years of state, federal and international law".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" in the statement of the "friend-of-the-court".
The lawyers further argue that the policies which deny immigrants access to the US are damaging the economy of the US, because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and provide the country with 'the necessary labour force'.
In June, Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, has ordered judges no longer to grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political belief," says Sessions in his announcement on 11 June of policy.
Asiel was never meant to relieve all problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people get to deal with every day, anywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation also got worse and worse.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, trying to comfort her feverish baby in an escape centre in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce".
Residents came back to their devastated houses and searched for valuable items they could still use.
Hundreds of people have suffered injury and the hospitals have been overpopulated in so far as they have not been damaged by the earthquake of 7,5 on the scale of Richter.
A few injured, including Dwi Haris who had suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of severe aftershocking.
Tears filled his eyes when he told of his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the remains of a wall," Haris told an Associated Press correspondent and added to this when he was in town with his family for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and later I heard nothing more.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'imimitation' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newsmagazine placed an advertisement of four pages in an American daily newspaper, in which the mutual advantages of trade between the USA and China were praised, the U.S. ambassador in China Beijing accused Beijing of the use of the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump last referred to the paid annex of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interference in the U.S. Congress elections of 6 November, a charge denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections marked, according to American officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put China under pressure.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed ever higher import rates on each other.
China's retribution rates early in the commercial war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states like Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and Governor of Iowa for a long time, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China", as Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Des Moine's Sunday's Register, "has now doubled the intimidation by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses the freedom of expression and of a free press, a long-kept tradition in America by placing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register" wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, at a kiosk in the centre of Beijing, you will find indiscriminate voices and you will not see any true reflection of the differing opinions that the Chinese population has made possible about the difficult economic journey, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused to publish his article," as he did not say to which newspaper it was.
Through the Kavanaugh-debacle the Republicans alienate female voters just before the mid-term elections, warn analysts
Now that many important Republicans are crowding around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various accusations of sexual violence, analysts warn that they will suffer a setback, especially among women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions around this subject have been enormous, and most Republicans have already made it known that they want to continue with the vote.
"These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, at The Hill for an article that appeared Saturday.
Reeher said that he asked whether Senator Jeff Flake (Republic, Arizona)'s attempt to plead for an FBI investigation at the last moment would be sufficient to satisfy the evil voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday, they didn't forget it tomorrow and they didn't forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called for "November to arrive!" during their demonstration in the Senate Hall while the Republicans who controlled the Justice Commission chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," Stu Rothenberg, a impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can go further, especially among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who often do not vote even if they do not agree with the President".
Even for Ford’s public testimony, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual harassment against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that there could be a setback if Republicans were to push through the appointment.
"This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former party president of the Republican Party, according to NBC News earlier last week.
"It is not only about the vote in committee, or about the final vote or that Kavanaugh takes place in court, but it is also about how the Republicans dealt with it and how they dealt with it," says Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats to be elected, clearly to the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be divided over the question of who they believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, where a small majority stand down for the latter.
A new opinion study by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe or probably Ford's testimony and that 35 percent believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was certain or likely to lie during his witness while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's accusations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford said last week before the Senate Justice Commission that Kavanaugh had attacked her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court has shown her his genitals during a party during the time they both studied at Yale in the 80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new Internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology legend project, is a company based on the open source platform Solid from Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the possibility to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We need to do this now" he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
Lists of contacts, activity lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored here.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it depends entirely on the user who has access to which information.
The company calls this 'personal empowerment by means of data'.
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to CEO John Bruce, that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers who have been contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to talk to "Facebook and Google about introducing or not introducing a complete transformation that will put all their business models on their head at once".
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
After the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web" added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: spiritual and wearer of the Victoria Cross from WO I honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I as military is honored 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann received the distinction following the attack at Bellengise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and thus never knew that he had been part of the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two small zones during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was 'brilliant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather had been distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense mist and under heavy fire of field artillery and machine guns".
He later rushed on to the fireline and led the line forward before he ran to a field-shoed and turned off three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German executioner on October 4, 1918, a little more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never tap on, but also something that makes me humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt very honored to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the braveness of a true hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you stayed awake all night to watch a follow-up Bellator 206 and you won't see the most important moment.
13 battles were reported on the San Jose poster, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just at the time that Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald got ready for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they stayed awake all night especially for this fight.
A fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to government regulations, after 6:00 a.m., no content should be displayed that is not suitable for children, and therefore we had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator when he was asked for the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, said that they are going to adapt their programming to ensure that the UK viewers will have a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the replay, that we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I switched, many texts went back and forth and believed me, these weren't all just as friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise this won't happen a second time.
We limited the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferieur' because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley says that during his childhood he felt inferior because of his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to secondary education, he did not realize that "not everyone is like me."
In a conversation with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said that he had expressed himself about gay rights to give others 'hope'.
He also said that the parenting had helped to reduce the value of winning at the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show has taken a few months off because of disease.
Apparently like a shift on Laverne's first program, Daley told him that he felt 'less' during his childhood because it was 'socially not accepted to like both girls and boys'.
He said, "Until today, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are real facts that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone" so he wouldn't let people down if they finally got behind his disposition.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time World Champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, 'has completely surprised me'.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you have to endure so much already," he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same heights and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important issues on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at 40 years of age, after receiving the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if they had already received the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't get it about my heart to say, you won't be there to sit on the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stoked and he died, I could finally recognize that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed about this all my life. To dive for a home audience during the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, who had attacked him strongly on his way to the games and which he still got from.
Desert Island Discs is available on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mikkelson, not in shape, on bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his form in order not to make it a sad milestone.
Mikkelson, who for the 12th time participates in the biennial event, a record, was placed on the bank by the team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of standing in the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and exercising the driving range, in an attempt to find out where it is suspended.
Because even at the peak of his career he was never known for his right drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs wandering balls routinely punishes.
And if the job itself is not yet terrifying enough, Mickelson in the ninth match on Sunday will bring the ever accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which is linked to newer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single matches start well, the match of Mickelson can be absolutely crucial.
Fury has shown confidence in this man, although he could honestly have been difficult to do otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me on the back, hit his arm around me, and said he's ready for it tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is included in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two matches.
I expected more of it, but it's like it is and it's the way we had to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mikkelson can improve Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the highest number of used Ryder Cup matches.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never completely equaled the highlights of his personal career.
Mikkelson won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games on his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain inescapable influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to get out jokes with people and he's a great guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to kill him occasionally last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great progress can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the European team's captain, knows from experience that the comfortable lead ahead of the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup, can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Deen made his debut in the race in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with the captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead on the Americans, but finally passed the finish line with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just so," said Bjorn, called here, after he saw the light of 2018 winning with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a jump of 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else in the team that this isn't yet a game played.
Everyone will have to make full use of it tomorrow.
Get to work and run the plan on the right thing.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's this trophy winning, and that's what we need to keep focusing on.
I keep saying it, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Rejoicing over the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead in this area.
A new challenge is waiting for tomorrow.
Tomorrow the individual achievements will be discussed, and that is another very different discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it's going well, but when you're on your own, your capacity as a golfer is only really being tested.
That's the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Fury itself has experience with both sides of this kind of conversion on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech" he said in reply to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, picked up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to get off well, like Brookline, or like Medinah.
When we get the momentum, there's a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have adapted our line-up to this and send the men on our way in the order that we think is best and, you know, we're going to try to magic something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the counter-offensive and puts Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I chose this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany postponed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have come into service in 2014, replacing the outdated warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will take at least one more year before it is ready due to faulty systems and up-to-date costs, reported local media.
The launch of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuertemberg class frigates, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the marine in 2014, but the disturbing problems of delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 serve to replace the obsolete frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a series of air defence and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to use the latest frigates up to two years apart from home ports.
The constant delays, however, mean that the advanced warships, designed to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are already out-of-date by the time they are put into operation, notes That time.
The fatal frigate F125 had already taken the newspaper heads last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into operation and sent it back to the ship yard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a ship builder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of key 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it were to be deployed in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the Baden-Wuertemberg-class vessels were operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It was also made clear that the ship is suffering from a serious overweight, which will reduce its performance and reduce the ability of the Navy to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price card for the entire project, including crew training, becomes a problem.
It is said that this has achieved a dazzling €3.1 billion compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest frigates have in their grip are becoming particularly important because of the recent warnings that the German Navy's power decreases.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Parliamentary Defence Commission in Germany, recognised that the Navy is actually "a lack of employable ships".
The official said that the problem over time when a snowball has grown, because old ships were taken out of operation but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuertemberg class were available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
New research carried out on a estate in the Scottish highlands, tries to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland follows the common and small dwarf bat, the brown large bat and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment shall be placed on key locations around the estate to track the activities of the bats throughout the season.
NTS and volunteer staff will also carry out mobile investigations using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the wings of the bat and what kind does.
A map of the habitat and a report is then produced to make a detailed picture on landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation consultant, hopes that the results show the habitat's main areas for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of pasture fields and how we can best maintain forests for bats and similar species.
In Scotland and in the rest of the UK, bat populations have decreased significantly in the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities affecting sleeping places and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightnings can also pose a risk, such as flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
In reality, bats are not blind.
But their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
At the NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares ashore in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who conduct regular investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Threat we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much not yet known about bats and therefore the work we do here and at other locations will help us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of control of bats before maintenance activities were carried out, as the possibly unconscious destruction of a sleeping place could lead to the death of 400 female bats and their young, which might eliminate a complete local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, to trouble them or to disturb them or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and of many of our species we just don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers prepare to persecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo charges of assault qualified as "fake news" and said people want to promote themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the accusations have been published.
The top of Portugal and Juventus is accused of assaulting an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to keep silent about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram, Ronaldo, 33, mentioned the reports 'fake news' a few hours after the accusations were reported.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the subject.
I am a happy man, and by and by good," the football player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a court case in which they wish to persecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called 'an unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the football player wants compensation for the 'moral damage for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the football room, where he raped her according to the accusation, as read in the charge filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a good guy for '99 percent', but that sometimes he is abandoned that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was with mutual approval.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement because she was 'fang for the consequences' and because she was concerned about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says that she wants to invalidate the scheme because she is permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and this summer left for the Italian giant Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' as car manufacturers leave
The United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' when it loses its status as world leader in car production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "careful" that Toyota UK had said to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production at the Burnston factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car producer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of no-deal Brexit jobs would be costing.
The Burnston factory, where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota are made, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that when Great Britain crashes from the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory stopped," said Marvin Cooke, the managing director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of a departure from the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most of the concerns are made by car manufacturers about risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
The Toyota production line runs on the basis of the 'just-in-time' principle, where every 37 minutes parts of suppliers arrive in the UK and in the EU for cars made on-order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there can be unrest at the boundaries that industry believes can lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota cannot store more than one day in stock at the factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped in that case.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is "exactly adapted to avoid border checks".
"We need to have a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also take this opportunity," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we absolutely have to go on with this very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the competitiveness of the company and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnston for 24 years, and who is a representative of the trade union Unite at the factory, said that his members are more and more concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented an exact and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and the deputy procurator-general Rod Rosenstein can be 'a week postponed' while the fight on the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump's and Russia's assistants and possible barriers to the course of justice by the President.
The question whether Trump will fire the Deputy Procurator General and therefore endanger the independence of Mueller has kept the Washington Rodel Machine running for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and to turn the president off by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, the round shouted that he was about to submit his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he wanted to release Rosenstein 'but not', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week's investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, causing the vote in the entire Senate to be delayed again.
On Sunday Sarah Sanders, Trump's press director, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set yet, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed a week, given all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by an aversion to the "thinking" TV journalists, although, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
She then suggested that immediately contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President is doing more question-and-answer sessions than any president is for him," she said, "without giving evidence of this, "we've looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly questions, that is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do that a lot, and you've often seen us do it over the past few weeks, and that's going to take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump answers frequently questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with technicians who are visiting.
Press conferences with the President alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated why, he made an open and bizarre appearance to the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The health minister has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and the desire to continue working with the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already declared itself willing to bear the costs of applying for a fixed status for EU citizens working for the decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also increased the preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is achieved.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Collecting from across the EU and beyond brings valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is sure you're at home and we'd like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery after major injury
The liner of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, went on an emergency operation yesterday after he had suffered a major injury in the Vanderbilt Commodore game lost, Mike Organ of the Tennessean reported.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident took place shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and more or less collapsed," said Reed.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the sideline before they put him on a stretcher and took him with for further research.
A member of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still no details of the type/size of the injury and Tennessee State attempts to find out when the injury has occurred.
Abercrombie, a 'red shirt sophomore', is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He has been handcuffed on Saturday a total of five times before he left the field, making it a total of 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher empties when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher empties when they buy a house in the UK and the proceeds are used to help the homeless according to new plans of the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the false is levied on persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise £ 120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher empties when they buy a house in the UK and the extra yield is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn, who attracts young voters with promises to ensure more affordable homes and to tell this to many suppliers.
The increase in the emptiness is levied on persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional revenue being set in an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which comes on top of the current emptys, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for the rental, can be up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year in this way.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new construction in London is purchased by persons who do not live in the UK, which makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the housing ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital city, have become practically 'spook cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had pleaded for a reduction in the legends to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices high by buying up land and not using it, and he called on May to abolish quotas on affordable houses to restore the 'consultation shame' in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a striking series of housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to suspension 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said, "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister on restoring the 'British Dream', that life is getting better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life.
However, it cannot be the case that it is as simple for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to buy houses here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people the dream of having a house has ever become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof above its head is already too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, Sunderland's boss, says it's his 'the ultimate ambition' to ever become the manager of Scotland.
The Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the northeast of England, which currently stands in the third place in League One, at three points in the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning to the Scottish Premiership in the last season of St Mirren.
"As a football player, I wanted to play for my homeland.
But I was selected for the B-team, and that's why the cold was off," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I saw with my father Scotland playing often in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps attracting me.
However, that possibility would not come until I was successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says that he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, earlier he had refused avances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Succes for me is currently being measured by 'can I get this club back to the Premier League?"
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful when I bring the club back there."
Ross is only working for three years in his career as manager, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from the degree to the third division and transformed St Mirren from the edge of the graduation to winning the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a football player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a crossroads," he remembered the moment he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I was doing the best right thing, I was quite well-deserved, and I knew some reasonable highlights.
But football can be heavy.
There are many things that you face weekly.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the trade, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I'm real, I'm so good at my skin, as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, revealed research
The summer heat wave has raised revenue from British pubs that have difficulty surviving, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw turnover rise by 2.7 percent in July, but the revenue in restaurants was 4.8% less, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA's business advisory agency, who collected the figures, said: "Continuous sunshine and the fact that England took part in the world championships longer than expected, meant that July showed a similar pattern than June, when pubs had an increase of 2.8 percent, with that difference that the restaurants were getting even harder now.
The fall of 1.8% in the turnover of restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars aimed at drinking sales performed by far the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also dedicated to the sale of food also from the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people were just going out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, drinking turnover was 6.6% higher for the month, while food turnover was 3% lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for foreign market turnover.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a turnover of 4.8% year-to-year is particularly painful given the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the operators who focus on food and only time will learn if the more moderate temperatures of August can give it so necessary respite."
The total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant industries, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales monitor for the public, bar and restaurant sectors in the UK, the performance data are collected and analysed from 47 operational groups, with a joint turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children has a secret account for social media, that they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11 years old, has a secret account for social media, that they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey among 20,000 students from secondary schools revealed growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a main account that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11 years old, creates accounts for social media that keep them hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students say that they use a clean 'head account' that they show their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who by chance came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered there a teenager who asked others to 'rape' her.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters and Head Mistresses) of independent schools, discovered that 40 percent of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half had to keep personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are enticed to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish athletics council
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Council of the Scottish athletics World, as non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for sports managers to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from her election in the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm glad to be able to vote for the athletes and I hope I can make a contribution and help control the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters during the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will tell me whether I will recover and to what extent.
It has been extremely hard work, but I have been completely restored now, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the support!"
Advertising for breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows divides online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has shared the online opinion with an advertisement in which nursing mothers are compared to cows that are milked.
To mark the introduction of what is called 'the most silent portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, consumer technology producer, has released an ironic, music video-inspired advertisement to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to contracting mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like: 'Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see it' and 'In case you didn't have it in your eyes, these aren't udders, these are my breasts'.
The chorus then continues with: "Pomps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's."
However, the ad, which was published on the company's Facebook page, immediately provided an online controversy.
The video has been watched 77,000 times and has attracted hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that the 'horror' of the dairy industry is condoned.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to be expected to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days after delivery" is written in response.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly in a diet (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else noted: "This is of course traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilarian'.
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'd buy one if I were still breastfeeding.
Those pumps made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking too much for it.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a funny ad, focused on mommamas who are claws (often in the workplace or in a toilet) and then have the feeling of being 'coy'.
This ad does not seem to be positive or negative on the dairy industry at all."
At the end of the video you will see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who are claws sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or snakes and fits discreetly into a food supply, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on the claws.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, says: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a tough and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between contracting mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to place the claws and the related challenges in the spotlights and at the same time show in an entertaining and comprehensible way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski's catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently move to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of prisoners of migrants has reached a peak, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and the harsh policies introduced by the Trump government make it harder to accommodate children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and they are afraid to put their own opportunity to continue in the country by reporting for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household should hand over their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared in a witness to the convention that his organization arrested dozens of people who have reported themselves as sponsor for unaccompanied minors.
The organisation later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of the sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and many of them are criminal strangers.
We're pursuing these people," said Mr. Albumence.
In an attempt to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules, which require some of them to appear before the court within one month after the start of the detention, rather than within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the staff at the shelter
Many of them will stand before the court through a video conference, instead of in person, to advocate their application for legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are considered not to be eligible for assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer the children stay in custody, the greater the chances of becoming anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to the staff at the shelter and according to reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates said these concerns are stronger in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child struggles are more often ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally for this or to say good - bye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria commands the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid Al-Muelem also called on Syrian refugees to return even now that the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moulem, who is also Vice-President, said that foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that 'this will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moulem, the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360.000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted and driven away from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this sacred struggle until we freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from an "evenly illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly involved in training and consulting Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in the country torn by war.
As far as refugees are concerned, Moulem said that the conditions are favourable for their return, and he refused to "disperse some Western countries irrational fears" so that most refugees stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicalizing a case that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available to Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major bulwark of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has turned away a huge attack from Syrian troops supported by Russia on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that this agreement had 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who were 'to be exterminated'.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN Member, hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution after the war for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moulem made clear the conditions of the Syrian government to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited 'to review the articles of the present constitution' and he warned against outside interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, his presidency was overtime ended by a suspension procedure and scandals.
In what would no doubt be 'the most dramatic final of a presidency ever'.
At the moment, however, there are no signs of vision.
Since 2014, the viewers at CNN over doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show from MSNBC is at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers in nights with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama 'Designed Survivor' a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaching Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
She asked.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the story lines coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being a well-informed citizen, when you get in mind that you've been sitting for six hours watching a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', who are talking about the jacket of pauvenle of Paul Manafort that cost $15,000 ('a garment full of overconfidence' according to The Washington Post) and who discuss the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
I will never be able to look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"What he does to give you the idea that it's a reality show is partly that he's putting you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the maker of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role sharing of the Trump show and the daily plot changes (a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you have the idea that you're behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He could not get rid of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh who had to appear before the Senate Justice Commission and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember that we did all those weird shows, not so long ago, and that the people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the most exciting interim elections for the House of Deputies
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees a flood of money, thanks to a re-scheduling of a constituency, which requires two sitting representatives of the people to fight for the same seat.
The recently re-allocated district of Pittsburg meets Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take action against another sedentary representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who knows a lot about the new 17th district.
The cards were reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January considered that the old districts were unconstitutional ('gerry mandate') in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a crash party in the area of campaign financing between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a fake victory in a well regarded special election for the 18th constituency of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump has conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for aid to China and has waived this
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognised and received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners set off the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States have decided to call back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision not to recognize Taiwan any longer' said Heather Nauert, the spokeswoman of the Ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
However, only penalties were considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million of US aid in 2017, for control of anesthetics, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
While internal meetings were taking place, North American and Central American officials launched a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from leaving the United States.
However, in mid-September, a number of government leaders announced that they wanted the conference to continue, thus making all possible criminal measures against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is now that Vice President Mike Pence will give a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance of the government assigning to the meeting, says diplomats.
And the three American envoys have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without hard messages about Washington's criminal measures.
A spokesman for the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next step may be the report of the special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible opposition of Trump's justice authorities, for which serious evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller will probably also focus his research on cooperation between Trump's campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If Congress changes color, Trump has to answer for that institute, just as he prepares to turn to the voters again, and maybe he should go to court for a jury.
These are a lot of ideas, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable or that of his equivalents in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, will have to make choices that will determine how long the battle will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to execute a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and Checho-Slovakie had supported in Munich.
We fail and thereby miss an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed, which followed.
The course of history revolves around such bending points and the inexorable march of democracy is thereby accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently confronted with various of these types of bending points.
What will we do if Trump fires adjunct procurator-general Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time when this magazine reported that he had, last year, suggested that he should take up secret conversations with the president and that he had speculated about the appropriateness of the president for his duties.
Rosenstein says The Times report is not right.
"How will we react if the new requested investigation of the FBI to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if it is appointed in the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will call Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting a very long winter.
But I believe we will not fail by the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me away to light candles for the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika was depicted.
With that as my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the game against Rapid Wien
Rangers get Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, a victory in the Austrians places them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Through a kneel acid, the civilian Graham Dorrans could not play his first match of the season until the 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use those results as a springboard to better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good 11th" said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the idea that something was going to win and came out with a point.
Maybe we could even have won at the end, but seen throughout the game, a match is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Next Thursday is a new great European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult match because they also had a good result in their last match, but if the audience goes behind us, I'm sure we can press through and get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been hard, of everything that happened with my injurys and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feeling-good factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can now push through, leave behind the past season and become successful again."
Women can't sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that participants in the survey had a clear idea of how to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said that they were talking to their husbands about the costs of long-term care.
And only 10% said they talked to their children about this.
"People would like a family member to take care of them, but they do not take the steps needed to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse(o)t(e) and the children: You can't prepare your family for care if you don't make your wishes well known in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care because these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Take a financial advisor in your arm: Your advisor can also give you advice on how you can pay these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care, may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenditures, or use own funds as insurance as long as you have money.
Place your legal documents: Avoid legal battle when insurance is to be used.
Make sure to have a proxy for health care so that you can identify a trusted person who can monitor your medical care and make sure that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider an authority for your financial affairs, too.
In that case, select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that the invoices are paid if you can't do this yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother encounters a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
In that case, could you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Put these details in a written plan, so that you can get the information by hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medications are used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes."
Man shot several times with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, belly and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'voluntary act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Because the means of communication have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the government of Donggala, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th birthday when the tsunami joined.
Donggala is a regent that extends over more than 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebese.
The Regentship, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebes, particularly in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are located for the most part in Marrowali, on the opposite coast of Celebese.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly affected by tsunamis in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesia disaster response agency.
In 1938 a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck in the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ateh on north Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Ateh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 on the Richter scale took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that soaked on the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 on the scale of Richter hit the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai Islands, off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and demanded around 300 human lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the rain of Pidie in Ateh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the destructions of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami followed, but more than 100 people found death through falling buildings.
2018: Multiple earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, for the most part on the north side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and made thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for accusation of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice-presidentship, is arrested for charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and opposition during the arrest, according to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman named him tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone off her.
Palin is held in custody in the house of Mat-Su with a deposit of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday and declared himself 'innocent, sure sure' when he was asked, the network reported.
Palin is charged for three infringements of Class A, which means that he can be sentenced to one year in prison and to a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged for a violation of Class B, which is punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of mistreatment of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now served by the Alaskan Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of abuse in the home environment, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon influenced by the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a veteran group, after she had linked her son's violent behavior to PTSS, which he would have retained at his service time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have been disabled while the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are circular videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, where eight persons have been killed, a rare sentence that has not been executed in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, used, according to the charge, a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, overturning pedestrians and cyclists who came on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov 'willfully' killed the eight victims and 'willfully' committed serious physical injuries, according to the intentional statement in which the death penalty is demanded, which has been filed in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury has approved the charge with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as 'graubous, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevitsj Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlei, Herren Ferruchi, Herrann Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is the intentional statement.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been more than ten years since a case in the Southern District of New York was demanded of the death penalty.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being sentenced to spying for the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by means of the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show any regret in the days and months after the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He let the detectives know that he felt good about his act, they were the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, told the police.
He did not plead to be guilty of charges of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said that he was 'naturally disappointed' with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a debt agreement in return for a lifelong prison sentence without the possibility of liberation, will only extend the trauma of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Sajpov's defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to mobilise a 'people's army' during a protest at the Conference of the Conservative Party.
The former leader of Ukip said that the politicians should feel the “heat” of the Eurosceptics, while one of the own Members of Theresa May suggested that he be the leader of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants on the march in Birmingham that if Mr. Farage had been Brexit Minister, the UK would be 'out of existence'.
But the challenge that May is facing in the reconciliation of the highly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who take part in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on the road while this is being attacked by Brexites, Remainers and the EU.
Fellows insisted that she will continue and will try to conclude a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, and so Eurosceptics and Labour force her to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to throw 'Chequers into the trash basket'.
He proposed that Farage should be run and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he left the service, we'd be out now," Bene said.
The member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers into the waste basket."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight to be subordinate in two world wars.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone suggested that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely untrue."
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are elected.
Let Chequers fall and listen."
In a message for May, she added: "Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the 'heat' if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "we won't let you get away with this."
In a message to the enthusiastic masses, he added: "I want you to set fire on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilise the national army of this country that has given us the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have again become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime Remainers marched through Birmingham and closed this march with a meeting of two hours in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the establishment of this group on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour High House, joked about the security problems of a Conservative party app at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a full-scale farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'think well' about candidacy for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the elections in November, she will 'be well-thinking about her candidacy for the presidency'.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told her about her future during a meeting in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critique of President Donald Trump, wanted to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican Member who was co-chairman of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been at the heart of speculations that she might be fighting Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
A present asked her if she would be preferable to the presidency.
Warren's answers are that it's time for women to go to Washington to recover our defective government, which includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after death of Wayde Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told Saturday that a suspect was arrested after killing Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man who was seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in the head and died from its consequences," said police commander Murphy J. Paul to the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and has been known to have been present at the crime scene, to be in possession of a gun and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is held in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 meters who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches and started last season in 10 matches. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel has let him win after team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that Mercedes's team orders would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and almost completely let Hamilton stand in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pit and let Hamilton drive into the bustling tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes later entered the pit and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on his head after a wheel-on-wheel action, allowing the Ferrari driver to release space at the inside after a double movement in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was the leader of the race for a while, because he stayed with his band choice and smuggled on fast finish, so he could catch up with Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, he went to the pit in the 44th round, after which he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so that Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri was doing his best all weekend. He was a real gentleman and let me pass.
The team has done his best for the places one and two," Hamilton said.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday about the fact that she did not continue to be the source of the leaked letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly talk about the testimony given by Ford for the Senate's Justice Commission. Instead, he showed that what took place in the Senate showed that people can be 'common, unkind and untrue'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and mean and untrue and untrue" he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then they say "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer... did you read the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't leak," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July the letter in which the accusations were mentioned at Kavanaugh's address was sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her desk was the leak.
"I didn't keep Dr. Ford's accusations hidden, I didn't leak her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go with it confidentially, and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president refused to believe her denial, and he commented on it at the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you something, that wasn't a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Furthermore, with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power, with all the necessary means.
You see the commonness, the unkindness, they don't give anything to anyone who hurts them, about who they have to drive to take power and get control back," the president would have said, according to Mediaite's report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars has compensated the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had two goals leading by points by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home plow along the side before Dwyer took the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's men, who on Friday evening had to make a backlog to defeat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer’s opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assist of Kendall McFauld. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy opening period Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the lead for the equaliser of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants entered the first rest with a lead when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team recaptured and Bouchard again brought them to an equal stand with a power-play-goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the race, late in the second period. He took care of the victory with the fifth goal for his team, half in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies, allowing hundreds to escape the earthquake in a plane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that an aircraft with hundreds of people could get on board safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that subsequently caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried under the tip in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild to-and-removing traffic towers of the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to ensure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was ready on the runway at that time, was able to ascend safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter came to Palu.
"It breaks your heart, when you hear that," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death toll can rise to the thousand and let the agency for combating disasters in the country know that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"People assume that the death toll is still rising because many bodies are below the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the agency.
Waves reaching a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN said: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
This is a tragedy now, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived on Sunday in Palu and he said to the military present: "I appeal to all of you to work day and night so that all tasks necessary for the escape are completed.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, leaving more than 550 people alive.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that ran the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one more man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger is missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked with the local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew members, after the plane had hit water during landing at the Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that the condition of everyone was stable.
What has caused the crash and what is the exact order of events remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say that the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has been shot across the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Janes said that he and some others succeeded by wading the water that came to their waist to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and yelling and that he had a not serious head wound.
The U.S. Navy announced that seamen who were working in the vicinity of a yard also helped in the rescue work by bringing people to the coast with a blow-up boat before the plane continued to sink in about 30 meters of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that during the last 20 years 111 people have died in crashes of air carriers registered with PNG, but that none of these concerns Air Niugini.
Analist sets the timeline of the night a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisitory on Friday in the re-opening trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, gave a single-hour witness as a witness expert on information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he used mobile phone call records to record the movements of the 29-year-old suspect Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night in which she left life.
Rowlett said that he had received the location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis to be with Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his earlier claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to Sanford.
Sanford was on the witness bench on Saturday and told him he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis spoke the truth when he said he was at Sanford in his truck during that night, Sanford said that he was 'lie because my truck was in Nashville'.
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis had told us that he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis knew the texts, calls and contact details of his phone.
"He knew her from his life," said Hale.
The defense starts on Sunday with the closing arguments.
The judge said he expected the jury to begin the deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hiphop'?
A hiphoptrio wants to debate the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol argues that hiphop is alienated from the origin with political opinions and the identification of social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hiphop' popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently had another revival in Britain by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A child-girl girl from New York is calling a couple for the judge because of a 'racist' text
A high-school boy from New York is calling a couple for the judge for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a misdeprehensive text in which the mother complained about 'a black man like that' again.
The couple deny being racist and call it extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her horror when she discovered that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a negroid woman when she met her on her first business day in 2016.
'NEEEEE WERE ZO'N ZWARTE', Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs Maurice twice as much.
According to the American newspaper The New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt 'uneasy' when she realized her blunder, was able to say that her former child-girl, who was Afro-American, had done a bad job and that she had therefore expected a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home with a taxi.
Now Maurice calls the couple before the court to get a compensation of $350,-- a day for the 6 months for which she was hired to bivak internally with the family, though without contract.
'I want them to feel that you just don't do something like that', says Maurice last Friday in the New York Post, adding, 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple beg of themselves on the claim that she is racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after, by insulting her, they were afraid that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who offended you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Don't worry about it."
Comparing to the trial with extortion, Plasco said that his wife expected a baby in two months and was "in a very difficult situation."
"You're going to persecute someone like that?
That is not so sympathetic', the investment banker added to it.
While the case is still in progress, public opinion is quick to cap the couple on social media, where they are held back for their behaviour and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking bear, reveals new hidden letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said about the letter: 'It's hard to stand in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington's enormous success, it's very pleasant."
She said that her father who, before being inspired to write the children's book on a small toy bear, worked as a cameraman at the British broadcaster BBC, was optimistic about or his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book 'bittersut' felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, whom she described as 'a very prominent member of the family', she said that her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so lifelike to him, it seemed almost like a performance of a child; you're proud when you've done nothing for it yourself.
I think he experienced the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he did the bear himself for the success."
My daughter was dying and I had to give her up on the phone.
Immediately after the landing her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad had called several times to say it looked very bad and was expected not to make it," said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then the call from Nad came to say that she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be back soon.
Then I'll be back with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping became slowly worked out and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this process turned everything off.
I could only stay there, knowing what was happening.
I couldn't lament, scream or cry, because I was in the middle of all sorts of people and families.
I really had to grow up."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the death of her daughter, entered the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she had to face.
"No one knew," she said.
"I sat down with my head and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Moving women stick messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who are loved by suicide are strong enough to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys Paste inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call people in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Ms. Davis her son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, Gloucestershire, tells us that her son was a promising chef with a dire grin.
"He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile lighted every room."
Yet he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he robbed himself of life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't stay silent - talk about it."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad or depressed or something," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He sat all the way to the ground on First Christmas Day - when the children took out their presents he didn't look at them at all or something."
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to deal with it: "It's tearing the whole family apart.
It's driving us apart.
But we must all continue and keep fighting."

Board Kavanaugh's future is uncertain while FBI research starts
'I thought that if we could indeed get what he is asking for, an investigation limited in time and scope, we might be able to create a little more unity', said Mr Flake last Saturday, to which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling 'out of each other', in the middle of a firmly entrenched patch within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has everything to do with timing.
The mid-term elections have been in five weeks, on 6 November and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, their attempts to get their husband elected in the highest court in the country are seriously hindered.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to praise Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus met his wife Ashley, who was the Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI's done the report?
Then there will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 republics and 49 democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, the possibility of issuing the determining vote to confirm Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of errands in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean errands to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came into power seven years ago.
Park Beeong-seug, which quotes from data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, states that there were 1,127 adulters last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for smugglers are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang didn't respond in public.
The vast majority of the break-outs from North Korea are finally offered to South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled via China, which has the longest outer border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the perpetrators to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often resorts to violence.
North-South relations, which are still formally in the state of war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, which discussed the stagnant negotiations on denuclearization.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, Singapore in June, where they agreed on a broad line to work on the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the lack of progress in eliminating American sanctions since then.
'Unbelievable belief in US action also lacks confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament', said Mr Ri during a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him inadequate to serve in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, appointed U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and found him inadequate to serve in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved like this, they would call her 'hysterical',' Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the accusations that he would have sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement Kavanaugh was very motivated; he sometimes almost screamed and was especially upset when he told about his family and his high school age.
He also emphatically condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him 'great and coordinated character murder' organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not capable of serving the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and by the way he speaks about the Clintons and the Democrats," said Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when asked if she would attempt to impose an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he were appointed, and the democrats would receive the majority in the House of Deputies.
'I can say this about it; if he does not tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he serves now,' said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District of Columbia Court (usually abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would speak out against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (law for affordable health care), since Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh asked questions about the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court at the hearings of the confirmation.
'Don't expect us to stand up if a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed to the Supreme Court', Pelosi says.
Women just have to admit this.
It's a fair tyrade of months and years of pent - up rage that's going on, and she can only cry to get it out.
"We're going to cry when we get angry," said Mrs Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She went on to say, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in charge somewhere and who said that she also went crying when she got angry. She developed a method, where she went crying every time she got angry. To whom she then spoke, she said, "You may think I'm sad, because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just cried on.
I thought that was just brilliant."
Tears are partly lawful as expressions of anger, because crying is essentially unobstructed.
One of my best-kept memories from an earlier job, in a men-dominated office, was when I was in a terrible mood because I was angry. An older woman, a chilly company leader who everybody was a bit afraid of, grabbed me in my neck skin and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy they got you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then member of Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extrajudicial affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (unofficially means that 'cat' or 'apenques') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder felt that there was no reason she would not put herself a candidate.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she told me, 30 years later, laughing.
"There were 7 other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind it with fund-raising, so she vowed to not join in if she couldn't raise $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give to men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign anyway, she became so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger over sexism - that she put into it.
'People will have thought that I was getting a nervous sensation,' Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the media responded to her.
"They'll have thought Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my gravestone?
"She cried"?
How the trade war between the USA and China can be beneficial for Beijing
The openings of the trade war between the USA and China were overwhelming, and although the struggle has not been fought for a long time, a long-term gap between the two countries could be favourable to Beijing, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the US President, gave the first warning earlier this year by increasing taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation became known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (€150 billion) of goods; half of all goods from China received by the US.
Beijing has taken represailles every time, most recently by increasing rates from 5 to 10% for $60 billion in US goods.
China has pledged to equalize the US each time, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to blink quickly with its eyes.
In order to bend Washington, requests must be granted, but public bending for the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays it cleverly, the trade war with the US, China could be positive in the longer term, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
'The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions which would enable one of the two countries to fall into an economic free fall is indeed far more dangerous than spectators have previously recognised', says Abigail Grace, a research assistant of the Centre for a New American Security, a think tank specializing in national security issues, which focuses on Asia.
Syria 'klar' to allow refugees to return, according to Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that lasts more than seven years.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, stated that the situation in his country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to normalise the situation on the ground.
All circumstances are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
There are estimated to be about six million people in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish commander Thomas Bjorn's team won the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was struggling almost the whole tournament, landed in the water from the tea at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shimmered in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever got 5-0-0 since the tournament in his current form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Oles from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes to play.
The highest ranking player on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole playing Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who possibly played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so soon, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a difficult year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the torch on to his fellow countryman, John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The tremendous pride I feel because I beat Tiger Woods. I've always followed that guy when I grew up," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled on the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at high level throughout the tournament.
The American commander, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team: 'I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
A short time this morning, we have made Europe a little more difficult.
We've been adversaries.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great commander.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (professional golfers' Association) and our Ryd Cup-Comité and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their commander.
You need to take your hat off for the opponent.
We've been overplayed."
Red glowed update: Concentrations decline in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report of the 'Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission' (Florida Commission for the Conservation of Fish and Fauna) shows a general fall in concentrations of Red glowed in parts of Tampa Bay Area (located on the west coast of Florida in the USA).
According to the committee, it is reported that fragmentary increases in the red glow are reported in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which might indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The red glow extends over an average of 200 km of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
There are about 16 km off the coast of Hillsborough County spots, but in less places than last week.
Red glow has also been seen in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations have been reported off the coast of Pinellas County last week, low to high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations at or off the coast of Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations at or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
It is permanently reported on irritation of airways in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
In the northwest of Florida, irritation of the airways was not reported in the last week.
