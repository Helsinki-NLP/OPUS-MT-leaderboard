Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, totaling 29 percent
A significant weakening of both parties of the current major coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led the preferred parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria after the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of the former Chairman Wilhelm Molterer was seriously on the tip.
In contrast, the election leader of the Austrian Alliance for the Future (BZÖ), Kärntner state captain Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphal return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but loses 5.5 percent of the votes against the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the ÖVP cut off, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially in the People's Party, which had demanded the preferred elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear advantage in front of the SPÖ.
The voters, however, probably punished the party for failing the government.
Even in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible withdrawal of the party president and former Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to renew the great coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both the right-wing populist parties - the Freedoms (FPÖ) for the time being received 18 percent, the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - at the same time the Socialists expressed their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party had agreed with the populists (then the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it split off from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which had even caused sanctions from the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who already stated that he was willing to cooperate with each party and went from a return to Vienna to Austrian federal politics.
In addition, the Green Party moved to Parliament, but it suffered slight losses and moved from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four percentages and therefore did not withdraw to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
In the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg's view, if it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who have been charged in India for the illegal collection of bugs, it could come to a certain extent to cool down the Czech-Indian relations.
After the meeting today with his Indian colleague, Pranab Mukherdshi, the minister of New York stressed this.
"If this is not clear, then surely, then there will be a certain cooling," he declared after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
After the talks, Mukherdshi said that the executive could only intervene in judicial matters.
In spite of all, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charge and received a fine, central government wants to go with the local government in Dardjiling, whose case law falls the case.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, Mukherdshi's view would be the best if he went to appeal at a higher court.
He could so request release for deposit and freely wait for his judgment, says the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed himself in the same way during negotiations.
"He recommends a vocation at a higher court, then there would be a mercy for him," said Czech Diplomacy Chief.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to allow the condemned "competent legal support" to be developed by the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that such help was already offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit this," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, the Czech press agency ČTK, in front of its partner, confirmed the importance of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and sue these Czech scientists," he said.
A reply to the question of whether he had received the commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the Minister refused.
"I've already been promised a lot," he merely stated.
A Czech judge on the ringing around the seabed
It follows an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are represented.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-member employees of the UN division for oceans and maritime rights.
His head, the Division Director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it.
Work and enthusiasm rule here.
The seabed has so far been a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil can be found here, other ore and other non-regrowing raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, for example the key to developing a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The countries of origin today vehemently declared their claim to the new sea areas.
After a UN convention, they make use of their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the territory of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometers far from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of continental reversible.
"Simplifiedly expressed, as a continental peel, the part of the seabed and its soles is considered to be a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the shore sea, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the Commission's country to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be confirmed by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated more than five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far only the last three countries have succeeded," Mikulka adds.
An international echo has recently been the success of Australia, which as the first country has been able to significantly increase its maritime areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the seabed, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
As they promise, the profit that will flow from the use of the seabed will have an invaluable value in future.
Other countries will also gradually submit their requests.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
There, where the continental reed ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, which is called by the convention as a "common heritage of humanity".
No state has any special status here.
The right to promote this area is granted by an international institution set up by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a gold grave country", says with some exaggeration director Mikulka, adding that "some areas are legally defined and the system is contractually established".
Czech Republic
A part of the seabed is also part of the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organisation "Interoceanmetal".
It was granted the status of a so-called "rail-breaking investor" in 1991, as did the investors of some less states.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the still ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the seabed.
"Fördern can be found there on an area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich find of polymetallic concretions that contain nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", says another lawyer, the Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with a bit of imagination, of the legendary shem who raised the legend after the golem.
German special forces were on site in the event of an on-site release
The Egyptian government had requested aid from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready for use, but they did not.
More and more details are becoming known on the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defense and the Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and officials of the GSG 9, the Fliegerstaffel of the Bundespolizei, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the technical aid plant were at the place of liberation.
However, as spokespersons of the ministries continued on Monday evenings, the German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid provided by Germany to involve it as local support forces.
"Sorry it didn't come for that," said one of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions had kidnapped the group.
After the kidnapping into a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad had been dragged to and fro.
Until recently, the identity of the hostages remained unclear as well as the details of liberation or possible ransom payments.
The beggars have now arrived well preserved in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the freed hostages were in the custody of the German Embassy.
He did not express himself to details of the release.
In Berlin, there was no information at first when they returned to Germany.
According to the "image" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown with an Airbus of the air force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
US representative house rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the US Congress has barely failed the $700 billion rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went out into the depths.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House rejected the government rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the program with which the chaos was to be controlled in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the advocates had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called the Members for an agreement, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, Dow Jones broke in by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason were concerns of investors that the government rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote to then, after being aware of the failure, crash again.
Experts now expect further serious turbulences on the international financial markets.
The adoption of the programme requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales increased significantly compared to the previous year according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, the Germans' desire to travel to a study remains undisputed.
In the winter season bookings, the travel agencies recorded an increase in sales of 31 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, as the Deutsche Reiseverband (DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study carried out by the market research institute GfK, booking figures have already been increased for the autumn months.
For example, the sales increase of travel agencies for October amounted to around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
The basis for these results is figures of the GfK, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and is highly calculated for the whole market.
The travel bookings made by the end of August 2008 were recorded.
Due to the weak dollar price, travels to the United States were especially sought, the DRV reported.
The increase in the booking amounted to about one third.
Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local territory of the Germans, are particularly sought after destinations.
In particular, vacations were high in the course, said DrV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of increasing costs for energy and food, the cost "is better calculated for customers than for individually organised holidays".
Among other things, money could save consumers through early-book discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months had also been very well booked, so that compared to the previous year, sales would again increase - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, liter-crust beer and promis in designer-dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's blond, TV moderator and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, connects us: hardly three minutes on the meadow, the photographers are already falling on us and cutting the memory cards full of - very flattering and that on my first visit to the meadow.
That's how to make friends.
The Cheap Dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the Weißwurstäquator, the feeling of well-being was still limited in the process.
But first we arrived at the Theresienwiese, it's half that bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks or touches embarrassingly - everything completely normal.
Strange views at the chocolate stand only reaps my jugs.
A Municher drew attention to the fact that I had misbounded the screeds: "Free left, middle virgin, given to the right, welded back."
Homely, I'm going to share the loop from the back to the left.
"Pass," she said and laughed.
Others make less effort on subtle flirting techniques and carry simple felt hats on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretchs the naked back.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitities is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous" with a long-term "oooooo".
That's what he tells me after he clears himself of his previous drunken measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, everyone thinks he's a trash.
Bob is one of these infamous "Wildbieslers".
Others do not have the luck of getting rid of alcohol in this way.
At around eight o'clock in the evening, paraphernaliars run across the square, which have to take care of the poor slugs.
The nurses always appear in the rudder - always four at once drag a covered support from tent to tent.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: Empty down, full back.
If you're in the promille sarch under the plan, you don't see.
"These are the ones where goarnimmer packs," one of the mediterraneans called me on request and disappeared in the tumult.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, residing in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's hospital in Romford but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of suspicion of frivolous driving.
In the meantime, he was released on deposit.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
A long time before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering deep into Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern side of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydrarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the travel guides tell you.
At the end of the railway platform, the building sits riders with a tower at every corner of the front and looks like a provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is disintegrated about
But once you are inside the curved ticket switch, there is no doubt about the superiority of the project, whose western access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad company.
Germany, which was a ghost in the imperialist game, had to implement before his ambitions, to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist projects paralyzed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence by Arabia and its Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable boundaries of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces pushed out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for Hyderpasha train station.
In 1917, a ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artful roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly decayed, largely passed from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gate to Anatolia and all east of it to highlight the extension of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ACP-governmental Justice and Development Party has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of neighbouring regions created by the borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
There is now a policy of approach.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian distribution groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the underlying dates of this new foreign policy, I climbed the night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the ACP's leading foreign policy experts, Mr Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a lavish journey on tracks that produced the parallel step of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is regarded as a new city, for the new worldly state project to turn back the Ottoman past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has triggered a number of mistrusts in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi brought me to the main office of the ACP, a specially made state-of-the-art stone and steel construction, in a developing suburbs surrounded by semi-finished shopping centers and pubs in which middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the day's first shops.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays, she must look at the east and the west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But certainly Turkey might at some point," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "didn't have to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone with whom I was talking about almost routinely said: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be capable, in the transmitted sense, of driving Europe as a whole on straight rails east to Asia and Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpashas station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German rulers Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now be, too wide, in the hands of Turkey.
And when I waited at the mooring point for the ferry that was supposed to take me back over Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least at that time, there seemed to be little doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus.
He was thought for teenagers up to 21 years old, but when the choir was singing the last time in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music that was presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never went on for years.
How often did our death stop us from "to let the music speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never glorious but never superfluous.
However high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher one.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor had been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the past 40 years or so about I have written reviews for more than a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I was never disappointed by a single one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He disgusted conductors who, according to his words, simply went home with one or two known pedestals in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (September 25) you write that "in 1946 he took over the teaching of economic history in Oxford again and in 1950 received a Hobblon Norman Research Fellowship ... while at the same time he studied for a BSc, a MA and a doctoral degree.
This is a conclusion from a author's note in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during that time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, who was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 during a Hooblon Norman scholarship and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
«I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life' because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, in documentary style.
They drew my attention to them because of their simplicity and because of the power they exude, how they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magic moments."
Second round of outstanding sales at Honda.
In November Honda started marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large-scale limousine offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are also technical units that allow even more convenient driving and saving petrol.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made at this grandiose are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you start to analyze the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter time, compared to the other manufacturers.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales on other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second sales market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars, 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 jazz models since 2002, which is 6.7% of total sales at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the head of the branch in Spain expects to be able to sell 2 000 jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model enables you to cover the sales reduction in Spain.
In reality, the leader of the brand hopes to complete the year with a total sale of 22 000 models, which are 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain compared to the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer’s market estimates, 50 % of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining proportion is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of Insight on the market is planned for the first months of the year, and for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters ), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has grown to 5 centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with increasing dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
On the one hand, this success is due to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution which was also used in Jazz's predecessor model.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a double loading area system, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres larger than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 liter petrol engine, because the capacity of Honda Jazz's trunk with a 1.2 liter petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except for additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility to build panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The second generation of jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 designs of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both versions have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque power for the entire engine running time.
The first one with 1.2 litres achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 rotations with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min.1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now creates 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-Beene', who avoids collisions
In order to promote the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarm behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from the technical development center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology at the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D-Brand Management, BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety sign.
But the most important are the facet eyes of the bee, which can see in all directions over an angle of 300 degrees, which enables you to fly in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to map the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles that are located at a distance of up to two metres before the BR23C and are in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a board-own microprocessor, which is immediately translated into signal for avoiding collision
In the moment when obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even greater angles to avoid collision.
The greatest difference to other systems is that this escape maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it were not so, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, 'Toshiyauki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory for Mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot can neither deviate up or down, but can also not be overangled; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way it makes the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
`This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require either to store the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of the storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MB of the storage space.
This is the first step in developing technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan is prophesing in the next ten years in the series cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and hold longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to lead to the target while driving, avoiding obstacles on the way.
She's shuddered before being burdened with a mortgage.
It must be recognized that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid the US citizens being involved in mortgage stories of the supposedly affordable banks, a entertaining and informative game was developed for the Internet-surfer: `Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe, the `hotel of bad loans' or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two, and up to three times, whether it is the moment to ask for any credit.
And most importantly, where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
It certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is rather a side for the teenagers than a place for all the spectators.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, if a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley makes its capital available for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into her company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, an innovation due to a strong fall in its stock exchange rate.
One week after a preliminary agreement had been made public, the two banks stated that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley share at a uniform price of 25.25 dollars, resulting in a total of three billion dollars.
The price accepted is below 19% of the share price of August 31.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertable shares, which will secure a 10% profit and can be resell at a price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be made on the basis of a uniform average price of 29 dollars, 28% above the current price value.
The Morgan Stanley share, however, dropped by 6.79% to $23,07, as against 17.00 GMT.
'This strategic link is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank', said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which should enable him to expand their business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest names of Wall Street to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed over the last few days: last Monday Morgan had simply explained that she would sell up to 20% of their shares to Japan for approximately 8.5 billion dollars.
'A week ago', in Tokyo, Toshhide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, we thought that participation would consist entirely of common shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% for its Morgan Stanley shares below their price value.
And the business will go with a reduction in profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into common shares in one year if the latter is exchanged more than 50% over the sales value within a given period, i.e. about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to make use of investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a press speaker in the group refused to give more details about the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a paymentability ratio of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that since the end of August, he has 'explained' his balance sheet.
The last few weeks were tough for the group who had to take a look at how their stock exchange rate fell by half, while the price for insurance against insolvency was rising.
This price went back on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other `survivor' of the big investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, 15 billion dollars, partly with Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic around the socialism of the 21st century was re-founded.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorial Rafael Correa.
That third party, following this Sunday, followed the example of his like-minded and friends, made the plan of a new constitution a choice.
Mission fulfilled, because according to the 80 % public results obtained by voters, 64% agreed with 'Yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% agreed with 'No', 7% of the electoral campaign was invalid and 0.7% were left empty.
In order to adopt the constitutional project, a vote must be reached more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the election venues and a census of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for `Ja', and he prophesied 63% to 70%.
In the night from Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa, by the way, had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
"The Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way," he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence in accordance with the observation of the Organization of the American States (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points to secure 'new socialism', for which the President applies.
The constitutional project transfers government power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to 'developmental planning' in a country that lives largely from the promotion of oil by foreign companies and from the foreign currencies that those who move to the country.
The project, which will be driven forward by 2006 will also allow the head of state to have more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to resolve the National Assembly.
Correa announced that he would make use of this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also secures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also intends to prohibit the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an equatorial base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon healthy and unscathed.
In the morning they had been freed from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military base of al-Maza right next to Cairo International Airport by 15.30 a.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak with the press, on board a helicopter to the Maadi Hospital, an alien district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoy all the 'best health' and the kidnappers 'were not paid a ransom', said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the rollfield.
After she was captured on 19 September at an off-road car safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was again and again brought from 35 unknown kidnappers into hiding.
It is eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, one border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of Safari.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special units, from board of two helicopters, started the attack at night, just before dawn.
'On both sides shots fell and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled', said this responsible, who wants to remain anonymous.
He stated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported on Belgrade where he was just standing about the role, the secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
"We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men by the intelligence service and by the special units," he explained without further detail.
He also disagreed that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the evening, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle in which the kidnappers, six of whom were killed, including the leader from the Chad, and two arrests.
The army stated that they were in connection with a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soodan-Unité (SLA-U), which immediately fought this movement.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is central to the current electoral struggle.
All the better.
But an area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will rise up and denounce the pathetic sum that will starve the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or the national historical places?
What politicians will dare to remind the Federal Government that they neglect their monuments and their culturally important buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no proper laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government makes 3.5 million euros available only for the restoration of the Chinon castle in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbours have written in their country's constitution that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the American culture, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all MEPs and all the governmental districts, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the association of Quebec's historic societies, at least 40,000 honoraries gathered in 211 history societies are trying to deal intensively with history, save the numerous private archives with a few greeks, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage that protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers let go of their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments governmental parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux states want to intervene with the Belgian-Holdish Fortis Bank, which is a result of the US financial crisis in Turbulence: the three States provide the bank and insurance institution with a total of EUR 11.2 billion in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the Eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been continuing for one year, so decisions that are now taken in connection with the Bank could have a precedent.
For the purposes of the decision made on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank will probably sell part of its holdings, especially the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis started a steep valley last week, and in the second half of the week, serious crisis scenarios were already emerging.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too large for a pleite.
The Institute's securities fell by 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
In view of the current stock prices, the Group's market value is EUR 14 billion, which according to management is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion expensive American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is due to the transit of Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed Director-General of the Bank.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find itself interested with a factual offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor should shriek his money, it was called.
There has been no panic among the customers, the branches of the bank have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fuchs in the chicken farm
Due to the drug use of a person, life insurance and health insurance companies in America often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that in any case link the use of the drug data to the consent of the data subject.
These should be independent, otherwise we entrust the chickens to the fox" - quoted Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for track record data.
Insurance shall set the fees as well as the amounts of compensation in the event of damage depending on the customer's state of health, and should the risk be overestimated, the insurance shall not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was only concluded in knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: Based on the customer's identification number, he refers the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, saying which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from what illness the customer suffers and how his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-reducing drugs, it could be followed that his blood fat levels are untreated, which would automatically turn him into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so insurance has to do only more with the paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many drugs can be used for various purposes, such as migraines and heat walls, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurer's point of view, while the above mentioned is not.
For the query and processing of the data, own companies have formed which, before they refer to the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they must do so by law, even though omissions have not yet been required.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory examinations and combine them with the data on drug use, thus providing an even more precise picture of the health status of the patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and monitoring their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a private data protection law for health data, its effect is limited to service providers in the health sector and insurance companies.
The draft law has already been submitted to the Congress, according to which the authorities could also control data processing companies.
Dick Richard understands that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the data subject.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned is not able to prevent access to his data, as the insurance companies otherwise do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are quite somehow left to the grace of the fox.
Global menu from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are both the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main theme in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
The French-Indian Summit is also taking place today, in which cooperation in the nuclear sector is mainly discussed.
Although the European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging and democratic great power, which should be given more votes and participation in international matters, until now the Member States have not been able to agree whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed yesterday at yesterday's ninth meeting in Marseille.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and President Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, that is to say, to increase to over EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods increased from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into an agreement, so that air transport is also in the future.
By 2009, India would like to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to achieve a balance between the EU and India at the moment: while the Union is partner number one in India, New Delhi is only ranked nine among EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
Among them was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which condemned both sides to the worst, and also the convening of a UN conference.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides being blamed for the failure.
The EU stressed that it is maintaining its energy and climate programme, i.e. reducing pollutant emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India, as well as the proposal to close a kind of global compromise at the forthcoming climate summit, agreed to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on financial crisis.
The head of government of India is today visiting the French capital, where it will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India are hoped.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement is to be decided on 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for rights acquisition.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will distribute over 171,790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honor of the event.
The Deputy Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Property and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264 m2 exhibition area "Punto Italia".
A press conference near the Room Structure will follow at the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives will be discussed around the publishing industry in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign writers' books is decreasing throughout the whole, especially in the adult and youth sectors.
The billionaire Steve Fossett's small plane disappeared a year ago
Steve Fossett's small plane, the billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada desert on 3 September 2007, was found.
The items have been found on a 3000 m high plateau, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
Within the plane, however, no human remains were found.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely denied the last doubt during a press conference: "The plane has been located where a troop has been sent out. Now we have the certainty that this is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or near it.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Transport Safety (Ntsb) noted that a team was sent a few hours after the aircraft was seen, which identified the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett started a three-hour flight in Yerington in Nevada.
Yesterday, also in California, near the border with Nevada, some of the personal objects of Fossett were found by a couple near their home on Mammoth Lakes.
This is two IDs with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned one month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history through a long episode of records.
In 2002, he succeeded in the sixth run, as first human being to orbit the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without port of call with an airplane.
Among its many records there is also a 15445 m altitude flight above the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ads you don't expect
A suv that falls through its original design and the special line management, the inviting surface and its clear angle from the conventional schemata.
Mercedes-Benz has tried with this off-roader to catch up with the sector.
Especially because of its exceptional properties, the idea of the Suv Glk will be unconventional, which will be seen from 17 October in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz.
Thus, the advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the car sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, which will take place in different stages, the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como giving the whole thing a special look: the new suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear so apparently from the poster it is depicted on.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details at different moments, so that it can be put together again as a whole.
Without a doubt, with this advertising, Mercedes's concern is to introduce a new type of autoreclame in this more stereotype field.
But will it succeed in attracting the interest of the future buyers? We will see it.
Now is clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls who are ashamed of all of Italy? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been driving behind the Italian national team for years and which, honestly, until recently did not cause serious problems.
Never has there ever been any clashes with opposing fans.
The Group's origin lies in the right environment.
The sponsors are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other small groups from Campania and Apulia joined these groups in Sofia.
They carry the tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: however, on Saturday they were removed to avoid identification.
Their models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a conflict with a truly right-wing radical fan scene, that of Levski.
From Figc the Italian fans had been provided 144 cards for the game: all had been issued by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also controlled by the Viminal: among the people who traveled to Sofia, there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already pre-taxed in this respect, were thus denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified typhois can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban preventing access to stadiums throughout Europe.
So our Hooligans won't be putting a foot in a stadium anymore.
Thank God.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation offenders who could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be released immediately, and there is no way of justifying such behaviour," says Viminal.
That's why, "eyes on especially with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, in Apulia there is a small core of the Italian ultras.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sport Supervision), on Tuesday, gathers the Casms, which can count on part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed with no joy) who has been the director of the Osservatorio for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Before that, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of the Ultras Italia founded in 2002.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duke, but no doubt the behavior of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist – add No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are being gnawed in the country of their actions.
So far, this group had kept its hands on, but now it has to be considered what has happened and will be done.
But we also talk about the pipes during the Hymne Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but they allow me, but there is no education..."
