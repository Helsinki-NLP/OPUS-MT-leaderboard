Members of Welsh Assembly worry they're going to look 'as stupid'.
There is constration among some members of the assembly about the proposal that they should change the title from AM'e to MWP's (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of all over the police spectrum are afraid that it could provoke ridicule.
One member of the Labour Party says his group is concerned because "it's with Twp and Pwp rhym."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party says the group as a whole is "not happy" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "responsible" about the name change, but has noticed that it is a short leap of speech from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of stupid or foolish.
In this context, the Welsh letter w as the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter you are pronounced.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently designing legislation to set up the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what members of the Assembly are called will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wales 2017 gave the Welsh meeting the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the suggestions that received wide support to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As for the AM's title, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received most approval in consultation with the public.
AM'e seems to be proposing alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus can be a headache to the chairman, Elin Jones, who has to present a bill on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the meeting's working methods, including rules on disqualification of AM's and the design of the committee system.
AM'e will get the last word in the question about what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country name
Elections will vote on Sunday whether their country's name has to change to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The national vote was arranged in an effort to remove a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, who himself had a province called Macedonia.
For some time Athens has already demanded that the name of its neighbor in the north represent a claim on his territory and has repeatedly objected to his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the national vote on the name change, said that he would ignore the mood.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue, however, that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St Martin's are silent because churches in Harlem are struggling.
"Histories spoke, said the old people to whom I spoke, were there a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Not one of the two is more there today."
He says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People now socialize in other ways," he said.
"Creams are no longer neighborhoods' family rooms where people go regularly."
Regarding churches, he is worried that the money out of asset sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings filled with condominiums of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining refuges.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore the day these churches completely close will bring even closer, for most of the people who move into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black church worshiping nearby took over the building's title.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by John Howard Johnson, who led a bocot from retailers in 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to appoint or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members planned to rebuild it, they ordered the carilion.
Honorably David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at Saint Martin's, proudly called the carilion "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the carilion in July called it something else: "a treasure of culture" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first carilion in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carilion at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's didn't replace him.
Which has been playing at Saint Martin's in the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the laity leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church council, the congregation's governing body, made up of lay leaders--in July wrote to the diocese with concern that the diocese "will attempt to transfer the cost" to the church council, although the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complain of a lack of transparency from the diocese's side.
Shark injures 13-year-old on kreef dive in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured when he dived for lobster on the first day of the lobster season in California, says officers.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help and then rowing with a group to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought it was just the excitement of a first lobster, but then he realized "that he called, 'I was bitten!
I'm bitten!'
His entire keybone was torn open," saw Hammel as he got to the boy.
"I called that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which species of shark is responsible for the attack.
Larry Giles said at a media guidance session that a shark was noticed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of his body.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to expand to UK beauty stamp
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams fight with department shop-type beauty courses manned by specialist assistants.
As part of a large expansion in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and household goods are falling back, the larger beauty courses will be tested in 11 shops across the country and if it was a success next year to more shops.
The investment in beauty takes place while supermarkets look for ways to fill shelves once used for TVs, microwaves, and homework.
Sainsbury's says that it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which for the first time include trade names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bies will also get more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also launches its boutique makeup series so that the majority of products are vegetarian friendly - something that has been called for by younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in South London and a second which will later open in Selly Oak in Birmingham this year.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller quantities of food bought daily at local convenience stores means that supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the shops are going to look more like department stores when the supermarket chain is trying to fight back with more services and non-food products at the Aldi and Lidl outlets.
Sainsbury's put Argos sales points into hundreds of stores and also announced a number of Habitat sales points since it bought both these chains two years back, which, according to their grocery sales, strengthened the purchases and made them more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and apothec departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument about how the profits should be distributed from the pharmacists within his stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281-shop apothec for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyd Pharmaceutical Chain.
It says that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's trade director, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty courses to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be on hand to offer advice.
Our range of trade names is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations means that we are now a commanding beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'enraged' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million agreement
Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones walked away 'enraged' after TV provider Holly Willoughby withdrew her from a £11 million agreement with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothes and extradition trade name, Truly.
The couple’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trade name.
The This Morning Provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she would withdraw her.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den-star Peter Jones enraged by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand business at the last moment - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources says that Jones was "enraged" when TV's golden girl on Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business kingdom in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities - worth up to £1.5 million - have meant that she can't spend enough time on their home clothing and ancillary trade name, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trade name and would have doubled Willoughby’s estimated £11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones boarded a jet and exchanged Britain for one of his vacation homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority at a distance.
It would be her long - term future that would carry her over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw her was absolutely stupid to all those involved.
No one could believe Tuesday what was happening, it was so close to the introduction.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that's ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning Provider, one of Britain’s stars that lets the most money inflow, can drive the firm out of the bag millions because of the huge investment in products that extends from pillows and candles to glandation and house clothing, and the possibility that its announcement may encounter even more delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
In 2016, Willoughby set up Truly with Capp and Jones, 52, joined the chairman in March.
The couples have vacations together and Jones owns a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a trademark-ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business affairs."
Hard words 'and then we fall in love'
He mocked at criticism he was going to get from the news media because he made a remark that some would consider "unpresidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his kamma-"nuusreading voice."
"I didn't give up anything."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a big step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament were inflamed.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said Saturday, more than three months after the June leadership assembly in Singapore, to leaders at the UN General Assembly, that the North does not see a "corresponding reaction" of the U.S. on North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he observed, the U.S.A. continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic impact in his convention talk.
"We're making excellent progress with North Korea," he said."
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim produced positive results - that ended rocket tests, helped free hostages, and caused the remains of American soldiers to be brought back home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be prestigious, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into 'this crowded arena, we would have had nearly 200 people standing just there," Trump said while pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tidal Wave and Earthquake in Indonesia Destroyed Island, Killed Hundreds
In following the Lombok Earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been uprooted, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite to catalise international aid.
"In many cases, they were unfortunately very clear that they didn't ask for international help, which makes it a bit difficult," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain that foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson of the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the assistance effort.
Given the constant earthquake of Indonesia, the country is desperately ill prepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though a warning was of strength.
Traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is at its best challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's refined infrastructure a central point of his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, as he faces reelection next year, Mr. Yoko’s administration is threatened by budget shortages.
Mr. Yoko was also faced with the pressure of sluggish sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were displaced like Christian and Muslim gangs with machete, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons on the streets.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge kick good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premierliga loss against Chelsea for a purpose in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri gave Sturridge when he was about 30 years out of the Chelsea target and his team 1-0 behind.
He typed the ball to the left before kicking far to the target pole.
The attempt sailed high across the frame as it swirled to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga smuggled and fell in the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to come on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw edge coming and typing once and not thinking too much about it and just kicking."
Chelsea was 1-0 at half-time before the Belgian star Eden Hazard recorded a purpose in the 25th minute.
The Blues targeter played back to Mateo Kovacic in that back-up playroom before drawing near the middle field and nailing into the Liverpool helpers.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward-head he then led Hazard into the frame.
Hazard passed the defense and ended with a left foot-shead past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farthest target net.
Liverpool is fighting Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea comes in front of Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Death count rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami climbed to 832, said the country’s disaster agency Sunday early.
It was reported that many people were trapped under the garbage of buildings that hit the earthquake on Friday at a size of 7.5, and caused fires of up to 20 feet, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 38,000 people, was sown with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, under suspicion of murder after woman was killed
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at Grayson Mews at John Street at 7.55 a.m. with knife-sticks, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who heard or saw anything.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is at an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the circle of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on Dashcam film material, to contact us since they can have information that could be indispensable to us.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead, and that she was found within a property.
This afternoon friends who are said to know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continued, as the police said they are in the process of informing the victim’s immediate relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed into or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now said to be taking hours before being reintroduced.
It was heard that a police officer told one man that the whole area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She repeatedly said 'it's so awful'.
At 2 p.m. there were two police cars inside the cordon with another wagon just outside.
A number of officers were left inside the cordon to monitor the block apartments.
Any with information are asked to link @MerPolkc to DM, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymous by 0800 555 111 to log 247 of September 30 as reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell is becoming the newest memorial hit with 'rewriting history'-twis
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Talibanlike destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "sickness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's form would become a target outside the Palace of Westminster.
Nor was Cromwell ordered to carry out the imagelurgy of the English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his forefather Thomas in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's manjiphic depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still memorable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate representation is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid 17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually identifiable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Mordvark Exploited Chinese Jack
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in south-west China.
The man, who was only identified by his "Yuan", was found with a torn butcher covered with blood dead near a cage at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a Varkboer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly traveled Wednesday with his cousin of neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring piggy.
He said there was a great male pig in the cage with blood to his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pond pig had killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were blooded and torn," the cousin, who was called on his of, "Wu," said, quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera film material showed Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A Mark manager told the Evening New that the pig was shut up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market authorities are said to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although strange, cases of pigs that attack people have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650 pound porcupine caught a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife scared off the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "sneller".
"They're not playful.
They're plowing, very curious... they're not trying to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Res from Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to southwest U.S.A.
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it passes over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flood rains across northern Mexico and the southwest US over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 m.p.u. from 5 a.m. on Sunday, a category 1 hurricane, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trog over the Pacific begins to take shape and move east to the west coast of the US. As Rosa Monday approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical humidity northwards into the southwest US.
Rosa will bring rain of up to 10 inches on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then tropical humidity in response to the approaching trough over the coming days will bring widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous direct floods, waste streams, and possibly desert landslides.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-place rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
So much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
Instant floods may be with rapidly worsening conditions because of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be very unwise to venture into the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause deep ravines to touch desolate rivers, and thunderstorms will bring violent local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring a little local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rainfall totals of more than half a inch are possible, which can cause small waste flow and smooth rice lines.
This will be region’s first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin to spread more widely in Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rain late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread Tuesday to the Four Corners and last until Wednesday.
October, intense temperature changes throughout the U.S. can see as the North Pole cools, but the tropics remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences throughout the central US is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, delaying summer temperatures will try to rise and expand again.
It is expected that large parts of the central and eastern US will start hot October, with widespread 80's from the southern plain to parts of the northeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a higher risk of above average temperatures for the eastern US for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Board Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the thrilling testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was said to have taken place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political death point continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-nipple turn: an agreement made by Arizona senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out a week of investigation.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was blaming her in drunkenness and trying to pull her clothes out at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent certain that it had not occurred.
It is likely that over 20.4 million people looked at it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewer steel on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that showed them, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes find it difficult to measure people who watch in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose colleagues strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was all the networks before with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long trial, said Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest was still high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was captured on Friday morning on CNN and CBS where protesters shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to a judicial committee.
He stood for a few minutes with slanted eyes as CNN was vividly visualizing how he was bad - told.
"I am standing right here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and went to the elevator door, saying that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks all later covered living hours when the Legal Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a voice.
But Flake said that he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would look at the accusations against the candidate for the next week, as requested by the Democrat minority.
Flake is partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democrat senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the voices to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuse critics of 'political game' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has criticised her plans to leave the European Union, accused of "political play" with Britain's future and of subverting national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper newspaper newspaper.
Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May arrives on September 29, 2018 for the conference party in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview next to one with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former minister of foreign affairs, Boris Johnson, continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should innovate each other's rates was "almost ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested at a second degree murder charge, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials issued a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the struggle.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said that they had found Simpson’s DNA on them, reports CBS-affilated WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted that he had shot Wayde.
His deposit was set at $350,000, reported the lawyer.
The judicial autopsy office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head at the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's fugitive-to-action force, the state police crime laboratory, Southern University police, and regional citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked territorial law application for his "earth and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot six predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average season was 5.6 points and 2.6 backs per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team beats in "platch" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about," said Wayde.
Volcano Spike Than in Mexico City
As spitting out of the Popocatepeti volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Ramp Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after taking up activity in the crater and registering 183 release of gas and ashes in 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple noises and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin low - gas windscreens in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophisists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano, which has reached 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists before commemoration of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence demonstrators were hit with riot police, and thousands joined counter-protests to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote for abduction.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police have been scrambling them with eggs and throwing powder paints that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually teem with tourists.
A shooting also broke out later in the day, and the police had to use their clubs to control the fights.
For several hours pro-independence groups in one tone sang "No forget, no forgiveness" in confrontation with the Unionists' cry of "Long Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries suffered in the processions, reported the local press.
The tension continues to run high in the independent region a year after the referendum of October 1 was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatis-catalans.
Elections voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those against suffocation who largely bombarded the voice.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried in violent clashes to prevent voting at the voice stations throughout the region.
Pro-undependence groups camped on Friday overnight to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments.
I've seen my parents cry for joy because they could vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital but navel-crap victory in regional elections last December, Catalonian pro-independence parties struggled this year to maintain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders either in self-contained exile or in detention in prejudices for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fired by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan pre-trial leaders since late last year, announced that he would be standing in European Parliament elections next year.
"To be a candidate for European elections is the best way to disapprove of the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Caring Home
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The resident unfolded Thursday at about 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingel.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage had been done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot at the car at a time.
Menga target gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s First Goal for Livingstone assures Victory
Advanced Livyston amazed Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga’s goal was evidence of the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved with Hibernian to second.
Gerrard's team stayed this season in the Premiership without a whisk and came next week to stand before the forerunners Heart, which is their eight points ahead.
Rangers are first Thursday host to Rapid Vienna in the Europaliga.
Meanwhile, Livingstone has expanded their unconquered love in the division to six competitions, with chief coach Holt who has still not had a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Plays Chances Against bot visitors
Holt's team had to run ahead long before they recorded a purpose, with their roundness, which Rangers had met with all sorts of problems.
SR broke through, but carried it in front of the fork, so AL could play far after he approached and met CH’s headkeeper across the gate.
The hosts were content to have Rangers play before them, knowing that they could get the visitors with death - game moments.
And so came the decisive goal.
Rangers lost a freehead and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson who together gave Menga the chance to kick and record a purpose from the middle of the frame.
By then, Rangers had dominated but could not penetrate the home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced a blow from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow typed wide to escape still open game of Livingstone.
Crossings repeatedly reached Livingston’s frame and repeatedly stopped, while two punishments were turned away – after Halkett’s challenge of substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Special' of Livingstone – analysis
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and results for Livingstone.
Up to the last man was excellent; they still exceed expectations on this upward course.
Their game style and manhood are almost unchanged since their return to first - grade, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge in his manjiphic defense arrangement while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as at times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once could they penetrate the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, which they found in middle division.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue air on Saturday (29 September) when leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
That's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had an outage on issues including human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey’s entry to the EU.
Erdogan was then allowed to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police quoted security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from coming together before the mosques, but many supporters arrived to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of their Kurdies – also made their voices thick and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The warring demonstrations reflect the division of a visitor whom some German Turks greet as hero and are cast out as autocrats by others.
Deptford road accident: Biker dies in collision with motor
A cyclist died in a collision in London involving a car.
The collision took place about 10:15 BST near the connection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision came months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-step on Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials work at identifying the man and informing his immediate relatives.
Road circuits and bus bypasses were recommended instead, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Warders Injured in Uproar
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high security man's prison, said the prison office.
Rugging broke out on Sunday about 09:30 BST and was still going on at HMP Long Laartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado Guards" have been called upon to handle the riot, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prisoner service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff has been designed to pay attention to a continued resident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six personnel were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible for the police will be referred to and can stay behind bars longer."
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the chief captain of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called to pay attention to serious disorder in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Dreeg Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kit Floods (Drought Areas Trekking Benefits)
It's unusual for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona but that's exactly what could happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwest desert and brings rapid flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood guards for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and by Monday will approach with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a twit that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Hurricane Center’s models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. southwest, including the central Rocky and the Great Come, will likely get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated total possible up to 4 inches.
For those outside of immediate risk, Rosa's rain will likely be a blessing since the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, from this rainfall will likely be beneficial since the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Droogtemonitor, only over 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, the second highest category," reportedweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s road leads to approaching land across the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still against hurricaneal strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler water in the Pacific Ocean, so her strength decreases.
Thus, she is expected to reach the country at tropical storms in Mexico on Monday or evening.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and present a significant flood risk.
"Reevaltals from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," reportedweather.com.
Rosa will then move as a tropical storm north across Mexico before it reaches the Arizona border in the early hours of the morning as a tropical depression and will then pass through Arizona and into southern Utah against late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa is very severe rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the U.S. southwest," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to cause life - threatening floods and torrents of ruins in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys a 20-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds were found in Somerset.
The injured teenage son was found on Saturday at about 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was still in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, said Avon and Somerset Police.
Officials appealed to anyone who might have any cell image material of what had happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh that 'feeling under the commonplace, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A voice for judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffered among the common, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday before the Congress and fervently and emotionally denied a claim from Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed about her claim during the trial.
The president said on Saturday the Americans saw Kavanaugh's "brillant and quality and courage" that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most qualified legal spirits of our time, a jury with a pure record of public service," he said to the crowd West Virginia supporters.
The president alluded to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I don't stand, but actually I stand," he said.
That's why I fight for these candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and hinder."
The first important procedural voice on the Senate floor over Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not to take place later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths from Indonesian tremor, tsunami, with figures still rising
At least 384 people died and many washed away when huge waves broke on beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered together on Friday in the city of Palu on the beach for a feast on the beach when fires of up to six feet (18 feet) broke high at sunset on the beach, washed away much after their death, and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed after a 7.5-range earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNP during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami had not come on its own, it had cars, logs, houses dragged together, it had hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges that were distorted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, aftershocks were still shaking the coastal city.
A series of earthquakes is feeling in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s agency for the evaluation and application of technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s giant shaking was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sat at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have worsened the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "sightly" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
Bodys of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the shoreline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake.
Communication "is completely disabled with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday because they had not told that a tsunami Palu had hit, although officials said that the waves had come at the time the warning had been issued.
In amateur imagery shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard with desperate warnings about the coming tsunami screaming at the people at the bottom of the street.
Within minutes a wall of water strikes the beach and sleighs buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately declare the image material authentic.
The shaking and tsunami caused major power interruptions that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but out - of - date refugees still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city airport was reopened only for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo would visit extermination centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-tsunami mortality rates rise above 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision's personnel from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City where employees in deck shelters built in their office courtyard, they drove by on their way at scenes of destruction, said Mr. Doseba.
They told me that they had seen many houses that had been destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even while assistance groups begin with the terrible task of launching the disaster relief task, some people complained that foreign auxiliary workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu with much experience.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies, and staff from overseas can only start after the area of the disaster has been declared national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a disaster on provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "Well, it's a national disaster," we can open it up to international assistance, but it doesn't have a status yet."
With the arrival of the second night on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad story line of natural disasters.
Saturday a little boy was taken out of a sewage pipe.
On Sunday, rescuers saved a woman for two days under rubble were stuck with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that had ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon relates how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated on social media under the paragliding society, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, were only answered with one gray mark, instead of two blue marks.
"I think it means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26 750 while refilling ATM by Newport on the Life
Thieves stole $26 750 from a Brink's worker who had replenished an ATM by Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The car driver was emptying an ATM in an entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man came running from behind the Brink's worker and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities must contact Newport-polisie at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name – to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had for some time nicknamed Ye and had used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new all Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grande on the program that canceled for "emotional reasons", the program's manufacturer said.
Besides being a abbreviation of his current professional name, West has in the past said that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he discussed his album title with radio provider Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye only – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous raptors who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known among others as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West-cooperator, JAY-Z, has also come up with or without a link mark and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use force against civilians
Mexican newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has in the run up to the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students to never use military power against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never ever use the army to control the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where up to 300 people died at a time when left-handed student movements were taking place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and open up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities are moving youth to gangs.
US needs to double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in that field, investors and AI practitioners Kai-Fu Lee, who worked on Google, Microsoft, and Apple, said.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even if short the U.S. a complete formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: it aims to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Dubbel the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
The doubling of funding can double the chances that the next major AI performance in the U.S. will be reached, Lee said in an interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In 1980's at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that knocked the highest rated American Otello player and later became a manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government chairs, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders away; it's the corporates," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have appointed influential individuals from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to help the U.S. AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI," he said.
China’s State Council issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence aimed at involving partners from the industry and the academic world and the White House announced the formation of a Church Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, US legislation intended to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has come under fire for months.
Macedonians must change voice in election or country name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum Sunday about whether their name should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", action that would solve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership bots for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that their northern neighbor's name represents a demand in the area and refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments made an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boikot campaign had raised doubts about whether the attendance would meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum voting letter read: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argued that it was a price that could be paid to allow Macedonia, one of the countries that came into existence from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to pursue bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us, Olivera Georgijevska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough parliamentarians have said that they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide.
The name change will require a second-third-centuryr in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of injustices by 1 p.m.
But the attendance was then only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voters in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country’s name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small high chair and drew closer to tents prepared by those who went the referendum boikot.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring a lot of necessary investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the great majority will be in favor of it, for more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he cast his voice.
He said a "yes" rash will be "affirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A setback in the referendum will be the first serious setback for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates throughout Brighton defense for purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2.0 won on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it appear ridiculously easy during his purpose in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the series, the Argentine targeter was given an ad at the middle field.
He chased between three Brighton defenders before he struck the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed by one defender before he had passed several others on the edge of the Brighton target hook.
He then pushed an emissary to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English predictor used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to knock the Brighton targeter Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems with his feet," said City-driver Pep Guardiola to journalists.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We're lucky that he's recorded a purpose at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premierliga struggle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few contacts before he led Sterling to the farthest angle.
The Sky Blues predicted kicking the ball into the net just before he was over the backline.
City takel Hoffenheim in Kampioneliga Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be better at Rockies.
With the Nationals who are out of the playing game, there is not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competing Scherzer wants to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there's still playthroughs for the Rockies, which has a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have achieved at least a promoter’s place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday evening, but still wants to capture their first divisional title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play on the highest level of any point of I will stare in the face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to share in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their starting player for Sunday but are reportedly favorable to have Scherzer thrown into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have started his 34th, had a throw-in session on Thursday and will play on his normal rest-sunday.
Washington's right hand is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outs in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the middle - term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing and that's why I fight for these candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, "One sees this awful, awful radical group of Democrats, one sees it happening now.
And now they are determined to take back the power by using any possible way, one sees the commonness, the genius.
They don't care who they hurt, who they must walk over to gain power and control, that is what they want, power and strength, we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, were on a mission to "stand up and hinder."
"And one sees it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "worship and mean and geniusy and false."
By name, he referred to Senate’s judicial committee’s high - ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received hard bows from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you had the document leaked?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I wait one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Workers' Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to put me under censure, it wasn't a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string of laborer party LPs who told us that we're not welcome – all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatments because she was fearlessly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the sensation of censorship criticized me because I was different from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Workers' Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Workers' Party LP, that was exactly what Friday's AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, it is not today the tone of many meetings and the promise of "friendlyr, more benevolent" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labor Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party’s leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political outlooks began to expect me to make an U turn and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with – whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there's a tyrid of abusive speech on social media asking that I'm not re-elected, disapproval of politics from the core and telling me that I shouldn't be in the laborer's party.
And it is not just my experience.
Actually, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the remarks that are directed at me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of mistrust" or change of selection rules become the party narrower.
I have had a lot of advice over the past two years that encourages me to remain under the radar, not to be so pronounced and that I will then be "select".
But I did not go into politics to do so.
Since joining the Workers' Party 32 years ago, encouraged by the Thatcher government's neglect that literally dropped my high school, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my policy positions and areas where I differed from the present leadership.
To those who advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country that sends off on a Brexit that will damage all households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the laborer's party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my voters, whether they are members of the Labor Party or not: I am proud of serving you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political advantage will hold me back from doing what I believe in all of you is the best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr top
Two late threes may have carried out the final outcome slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderful-delightful Tennent's Premiership competition of the day.
They are now at the top of the score ladder, the only unconquered team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, which the home team carried, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be content.
"We have so far been tested in our competitions and we are still unconquered, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honor to Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, which was intended by Frazier Climo, made Ayr before, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, who was made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot recorded an unintended three.
Clima enlarged Ayr's lead with a penitentiary, just before he, just before rest time a solo three meant to make it rest time 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, inscribed by Baggot, reduced the backwardness to five points.
There was a long stopover for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott, which was carried on a portable, and from the reboot Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall-three, besieged by Clima.
Ayr's substitute captain Blair Macpherson then found a yellow card and once again Melrose used the extra player with an unintended three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of much printing game.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he took hold of Climo without the ball, and from the penal stand MacPherson pushed the ball to death after the coming Ayr-free meal.
Climo meant that, too, he almost did it from the restart, after having obtained Kyle Rowe David Armstrong's target head and sent out flank Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth three.

'The sea is ours': country-based Bolivia hope court will reopen away to the Pacific Ocean
Matrose patrols a maswerk-covered fleet quarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
River bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are bound with the slogan: "The sea is right to ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the landscaped Bolivia is the memory of the coastline which they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, still fresh – nesting the need to travel again to the Pacific.
That hope is probably the highest it was in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a verdict by the international court on October 1, after 5 years of discussions.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and naturally expects the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH pronouncement on large screens across the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – who next year stared a controversial struggle for re-election – also had many that depended on Monday’s verdict.
"We are near to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor – and that if so, little will change.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to allocate Chilean territory, and it has defined that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's verdict comes only six months after the last demonstration shows that the case was "not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than help Bolivia’s case, the past four years may have delayed it.
"The question of access to the sea was bought by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales ’ aggressive rhetoric had tapped any remaining Chilean kindness, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume discussions at one time, but it will be extremely difficult to engage in close negotiations.
The two countries had last exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision - making was unusually rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "bring an end to 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, uses the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless they can trust U.S.A.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a Singapore meeting between the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments follow after U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo apparently on the brink is to restart nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end, more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "throom image" that continued sanctions and US-chapter to a statement that the Korean War has ended will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration without first taking significant steps to disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump wants a second counsel.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country sees as the only way to guarantee their security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump board.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest series of major head coverings on the way to the shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely turn the sun away, you do not need to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced at their SS19 collection a series of slave oversized head coverings on the treadboard that enchanted the style at Paris Fashionweek.
Extremely impractical hats went through Instagram this summer, and these designers paraded their dazzling creations on the treading board.
The exceller by Valentino was a large beige hat with a feathery wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other major additions included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a magic hat and even a pineapple – but it is not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had covered lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute coutures.
One creation looked like scuba equipment, including snorkeling and diving glasses, while another looked like a molten ice rink.
And if you continue the great fashion, it is your happy day.
Stylish viewers predict that the huge hat may be on the way to the shops near you.
The big hats follow shortly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide edge seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat that was spread over social, sent another great creation across the treading board – a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimwear model it wore.
The burned orange raffiasak, finished with raffiafraiings and finished a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera' SS19 collection at Paris Fashionweek.
Famous silence Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags appearing in shops for next summer—because the designer has made such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for superlatives.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a rites of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which was only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community ventures.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their schools and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their schools for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable choice of subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages at the top are the liga charts with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages have obtained a higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS' 74 membership schools showed that 72 percent students had obtained a higher grade A in Mandarins, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will no doubt need in the future.
Now, as subject choice, many have the same prestige as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent schools of currikula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission on Occupations and Skills found in 2014 that of the reasons that employees provide why they are struggling to fill posts, 17 percent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Hence, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, in the future they will have a real advantage with such a lifelong skill.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically put above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why investing in today’s children is so important now.
To know various languages, especially those of developing economies, children will rest with a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will be considered essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarins or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
It can't be denied at this point, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, so it should be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages really need to be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
Il sucks bee faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut Sunday for San Diego Lakers
The guard is almost over for supporters to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers-trainer Luke Walton announced that James would play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego in the Sunday season.
But just how many minutes he will play still have to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell has admitted that James would probably play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers ’ six competitions in the pre-sale program.
"I don't need pre-season matches at this point in my career to get ready," he said.
Trump’s West Virginia convention time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of elections in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five scheduled controversies in the next week, including stopping in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the affirmative voice currently held back for his choice of filling the crafts in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming interim election because Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
How late is Trump's contract in West Virginia tonight, and how do you look at it online?
Trump’s merger in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. ET this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can look below at Trump's merge in West Virginia by living flow.
Trump will probably give attention to this week's hearings for the appointed Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense about accusations of sexual misconduct with a expected confirmation voice held back for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main aspect of this excess is to help the Republicans who are facing difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign thus said that these five controversies were aimed at visiting "voluntaries and supporters the next week while Republicans tried to protect and enlarge the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Government over Congress is so critical for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to call his name, told Reuters.
This evening, arranged for the West Banco arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind according to the voting patterns.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to give him a boost at the poll," said Reuters, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryderbeker 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have courage for the struggle to keep the hope alive when they enter in Sunday’s single game
After three one - side sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum is an all-encompassed sport concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and certainly in competitions like this.
Where, then, would they say that the momentum is now?
"They went forward with six points and now it's four, so we carry it as a little momentum, I suppose," said Jordan Spieth when he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead, and another twelve.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there is much to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and recorded three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the yard to the clean field and led by his example.
That band of celebrations became louder as his round progressed and he sank a critical setting to win competition four completely equal while he and Thomas were after two rounds with two backs.
She set up who won the game at 15 for them, was greeted with a similar scream, the kind that tells a person that he believes that the American team has another chance.
"You really should take everything out and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That is all those players now have left.
18 pieces to print off their stamps.
The only players who have had more points over the past two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s few but charming couple got four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't keep one on job rates on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Saturday morning one holding on job rates as well as during the back nine Friday morning.
That poop, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this exuberant crowd, confirm that they are the players to be knocked on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can sound a potential European victory when the sun over Le Golf National bag.
Prefer both at once or at different times.
However, it is still too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short quarters with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s four - ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One held on track rate and two doubles on front nine, the Spaniard and the Sweed ended up in a hole from which they couldn't even almost come.
Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-balls and four-game teams are so exciting to watch closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can turn into an instant.
Europe has always played better as a team and has taken significant lead on the last day, but this four-game session has also shown that the U.S. team has the courage to fight what some, especially at home, doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 during the last day of the Ryder cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder cup after they have come out of Saturday's four-ball and four-game games with a lead of 10-6.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two triumphs over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score to four points as far as Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to maintain the trophy that lost them to Hazeltine two years ago, had a U.S. team that accomplished unevenly in the morning's four-balls, so that they won the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the four games and won two games, but they did not shrink the back.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single - game games to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who won four points in a row while he and Molinari, who are called "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, is just the second pair in the history of the Ryderbeker who recorded four points after their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls, they played well together to conquer a Dad Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but he now lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2–11 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka--who is first and third on the world rankings.
On a pleasant day, however, Europe did not always get their own way with a little wind southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth who won three times a big tournament and Justin Thomas set Saturday the mark for the Americans with two points.
They recorded a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3/4 in the four games after losing the first two pieces.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder cup have a team recovered from a delay of four points when they entered the single game, even though Furyk's team just had to play equally to maintain the trophy because they already kept it.
When they were second-best for two days, it didn't seem, however, that they'll manage a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they'll unrestrainedly unresponsively unarm 'deeply'
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions aggravate their distrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such traits.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that in the past year North Korea had taken "significant benevolence measures", such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, breaking down the nuclear testing site and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we see no corresponding reaction from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not disarm ourselves alone first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "tasted" approach to removing nuclear weapons by which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his words seemed significant in that it did not absolutely reject unilateral removal of nuclear weapons as Pjongjang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a president of the U.S. and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June when Kim undertook to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pjongjang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted requests for strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by intensifying the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the 'explainment of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The prophecy that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions make our distrust worse."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, on which the U.S. leader had drawn attention earlier in the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings during the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party were in this issue about the destruction of nuclear weapons South Korea and not the U.S., the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
The tone of Ri's speech was still dramaticly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would be directed on the U.S. land mass after "Mr. Bose President" Trump for Kim called a "prayman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations Trump, who threatened last year to destroy North Korea "fully," gave Kim abundant praise for his courage because he took steps to disarm, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions still have to remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a timeframe for this, and said "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the steps they have taken.
But, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said Thursday to the UN Security Council: "Adaptation of sanctions by the Security Council must be zealous and without letup until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously intensified sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to dry up funds for Pjongjang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and afterward said he would visit Pjongjang again next month to prepare for a second summit meeting.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pjongjang in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea only charged him hours later that he had "set ganglike demands."
North Korea, in a meeting with Moon, promised to break off a missile site and also set up a core complex as the United States "corresponding measures".
He said that Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he wanted to see are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps toward normalizing relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year leaves all of its pregraduate students getting more sleep in an effort to counteract the growing macho culture of studying by affeine-driven 'all-night sessions'.
An academic has found that students at the world's top university are often uninformed when it comes to the basic principles of caring for themselves.
Charles Czesler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed to be the first of his kind in the U.S.A.
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a talk about the effect of sleep withdrawal on learning.
'At the end of it one girl approached me and said, 'Why do they tell me it only now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had yet told her how important sleep is--which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, presented for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances, as well as how they improve their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after having been found that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour long course involves some interactive tasks.
In one department there is a picture of a dormitory, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep disability and the importance of a sleeptime routine.
In another department, participants are told how long-term sleep loss can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know that won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know--just as you have the right to know the health effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Prof Czesler.
The culture of pride to study 'all night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have meant that sleep withdrawal is a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said--even to avoid weight gain, because sleep absorption places the brain in an starvation mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czesler design the course after he ran one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to work for a campus course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disturb your circadian rhythm and cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Purpose of Menga conquers Gerrard’s men
Rangers have experienced another sarry of day-to-day heart when Dolly Menga's target head Steven Gerrard's incomprehensive team has caused a 1-0 downfall.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first as visitors since February’s 4-1-sege at St Johnny, but Gary Holt’s team only awarded Gerrard his second in 18 games as manager so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which took place loosely in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga beat seven minutes before rest, and it didn't seem like a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is on target only behind Hibernian.
And there could be further trouble for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown off the roadside.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the final battle of the Betfred cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a tip of Hearts last week and he would have been in his nops with the way his well trained team had smothered their opposers at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated balbeties, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
In fact, after just two minutes, they had to scored points when Menga’s first deposit sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor’s goal, but the middle field player opened his high chance.
A deep freehead by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgov could only miss at the back stake.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have had a criminal purpose at the quarter point when he and Steven Lawless collided, but divorce judge Steven Thomson turned away the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half, but the former Ibrox targeter Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and a mammoth target of Oviedo Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener at the 34th minute may have been toward the direction of play, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it is just for their hard work.
Rangers once again did not handle a deep piece of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool head and sent it to Menga for a simple round.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but the impressive Kelly drove from his line to the block.
However, Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett that palmed long ball after long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor got up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgov could get far from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penitentiary when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Founder of the Geigerteller
And now a page from our "Sunday morning" almanak: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, and OUR TEL VERDER ... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geigerteller has been a supporter of science, and it has also become a support pillar in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bels of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is it?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these earphones, you can even hear the effects of the atoms that are released into the minerals by the radioactivity.
Evans: "Well, it's cracking about!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name survives.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' robber cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill robber cells
Dedust teaches immune system to identify robber cells as part of treatment
Method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, change it into a laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify robber cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can see a protein that occurs in many cancers and is called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "prof Berzofsky explained the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and teaching them how to attack cancer cells worked to beat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West started a pro-Trump ridicule after his action on SNL, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was released in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an elaborate action in which he believed U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would be preferable in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Greatpet, he sang against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I speak to a white man so often and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racial?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judicial committee on accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it was not broadcast, Western images were loaded on social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that it was difficult for him behind the platform for what he was wearing on his head.
"They tied me behind the platform.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat on.'
They buffed me!
And then they say I am in a low place," he said, according to the Washington examiner.
West went before, "Do you want to see the low place?" and said he would put on his "super coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comment attracted at least twice a publishing at the audience and members of the SNL roll-sharing seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication: "The whole studio became still."
West was brought in as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rhymcler Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with the performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the chief of TPUSA conservation group Candace Turner, who beated: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU BE AGAINST THE SKARE."
But chat program hostess Karen Hunter knew that West was simply "who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe accepts an ideology and preaches that endangers my community.
He is free.
So do we," she added.
Before the show, the rhymeser announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the being known earlier as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Mede-rhymkletser, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, white music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

The charge will be reviewed by the public prosecutor’s service.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword - blowing role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believed 'everything went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo-era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt 'reasonably strong' about working on this issue.
'I personally feel quite strongly about it at the moment--where did we go wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What have our husbands learned as they grow up with regard to the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth of toxic masculinity because of its extremely male characters.
He continued: "What was inborn and what was learned?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they must have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think it really is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because something apparently went wrong with our young men.'
in the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones-contaminations when the series next summer comes to an end, for he says he is 'clark with battlefields and horses'.
From November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thought that the best thing that came from Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I've met my wife on this program, so that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-rounded fantasy series.
The couple married on the site of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported alone in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, representing a change of past.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spreading through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who acquired HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS rose by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a critical case in China's LGBT society.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is still widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to deal with the matter.
Maxine Waters denied that a staff member had GOP-senators leaked their data, condemns 'hazardous lies' and 'conspiration theories'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters sued Saturday against claims that a member of her staff placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges were driven by "ultraright" experts and Web sites.
"Wass said in a statement on Twitter, lying and still detestable lies."
The selected information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S.-S. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel hearing on the claims of sexual misconduct against the appointed Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the placements was related to Waters' office and the information of a member of Waters' staff, reported the Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff--whose identity, personal information and security were put at risk because of this deceptive and false claim--was by no means responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie."
Waters’ declaration quickly provoked online criticism, including former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," wrote Flesher.
"It suggests that she did not have the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be defiant.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Flesher apparently compared Waters’ response to the Democrat’s criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of being seeming too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to lift Waters out of the pillows in the mid-election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it is true," he wobbled.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these deceptive claims.
"We will make sure that the managers are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally accountable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again - faint Rowan Atkinson spyspottery
It is now traditionally to look for Brexit meaning in any new movie with a British impact and it seems to have applied to this revival of Johnny English action comedy mockery ranchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and continued to struggle with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-chosen evenatirs on the subject of how obvious power we are is the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the unhealed Johnny English with its bulging eyes and rubber face had his license to waste everything for the second time renewed--and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English-speaking movie audiences.
He is, of course, the mocked secret agent who, despite his bisaric pretension to sophisticated elegance, a bit of Clauseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good scout had from that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of puzzles, who leaves chaos behind him, who played Atkinson once in the now forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest version of JE.
I liked Johnny English who came to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval coat of armor and cut the screws briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is shown but humor feels rather faint and strangely superfluous, especially when the "serious" movie trade marks such as 007 and Mission Imposible now themselves comedy with self-confidence as a ingredient.
The humor feels that it is aimed at children rather than at adults, and for me Johnny English’s adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson’s still - film grappies in the persona of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cybercracker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent in service--a lamentable little roll for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who's a puffed-up and besieged character, who's already experiencing a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson is doing her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there's little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been put at risk, she must call someone out of his retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now serving as a teacher at some fine institution, but who from the record teaches about how to be a secret agent, there are some nice jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type spying school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency order and are reunited with his former long - suffering companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an allamaptic roll in which too few Vicki Pepperdine are expected.
Thus, the Batman and Robin are free to completely waste everything in Her Majesty’s secret service and come down on Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister gets under the dangerous spell of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters they burn a French restaurant, causing chaos when they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English lets pure anarchy break loose when he tries to use a chapter for virtual reality to become familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene nothing is spared, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is quite a bit like children's TV.
Very mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't stop myself thinking, can the Brits not give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come right?
Labour denys that it is a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause Britts to work a four-day week--but be paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants company bases to have savings caused by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution transferred to workers by giving them extra day.
It will make workers enjoy a three-day weekend--but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say that it will 'fit' the party's economic agenda and plans to put the country in favor of the workers.
To change to a four-day week was signed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to exploit the changing economy.
A senior laborer savings source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker as well as with the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party which promised a four-day workweek during its campaign for the general election in 2017.
The ambition, however, is currently not endorsed by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman of the Labor Party said: 'A four-day workweek is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Skadu Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to expand his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'intelligent directors' and 'winners' at service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire investment back because a laborer government can make 'reductions' on the basis of supposed wrongdoing.
He has also confirmed plans to place workers on corporate management and to create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of the value of private - sector businesses to employees, who can obtain annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" or the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can make them change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh had a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least a week delaying and raising the question whether the bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could cover anything that could make them change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more responsive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Have you done this?
He was determined, certainly, unquestioning."
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be unchangeable.
"I have formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett zealously denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she calls could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the World Citizens ’ Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be New York's host to the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars that acts and has an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizens ’ Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy not only actions by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to raise awareness for the occasion’s real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international prelude group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free card to the opportunity (unless you are willing to pay for a GDP card), concerters had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was World Citizens with 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivisime" - people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a twiet?
Since 2011, World Citizens have said that it has recorded over 19 million "actions" of its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that so far the confirmed money has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", and promise to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after obtaining more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the UK, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the Power of Nutrition-ambassador Tracey Ullman in April 2018 during a concert in London to the crowd.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the common questions at his site asking "what makes you think that our extreme poverty can end?"
answered World Citizens: "It will be a long and hard road--sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we shall succeed, because together we have more power.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is among the artists who act on this year's occasion in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use fleet for "blockade" to prevent exports of Russian energy - Minister of Home Affairs
"If necessary" Washington may leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, the U.S. minister of domestic affairs, Ryan Zinge, as quoted by the Washington examiner.
Zince claimed Russia’s involvement in Syria--in particular where it works at the invitation of the legal government--is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just as in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he said.
And, according to an officer, there are ways and means to deal with them.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy doesn't end up in the market," he said.
Zince spoke to the residents of an occasion offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit hunts that considered themselves the "vote of the energy consumer" in the U.S.A.
He continued to compare Washington’s approaches to the handling of Russia and Iran and noticed that this was practical.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said while referring to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The pronouncements come as Trump administration on a mission was to give export of their liquid natural gas to Europe a boost to replace Russia, far more cost-effective option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump’s officers, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unfit" Nord Stream 2-chip project, which, according to Trump Berlin’s "prisoned" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fiery opposition to the project is merely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, at a meeting with America's Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view provoked opposition from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), appealed to the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kemp, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren would be "severely considering" to be president in 2020, said the Senator of Massachusetts
Massachusetts's senator, Elizabeth Warren, said Saturday she would 'severely consider it' to be president of the mid-term elections.
At a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government and it includes a woman on top of sports," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I'll seriously consider standing for president."
Warren expressed her opinion about President Donald Trump during the village meeting and said he "take the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very pronounced in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a Wednesday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI study before our voice."
A survey released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should stand in 2020.
Eight-and-50 percent of "like" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she had to stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former Governor Deval Patrick should stand, 38 percent who supported the idea that he should stand potentially and 48 against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed to possibly stand in 2020 include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont’s Senator Bernie Sanders.
Praying said he would officially decide in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSV at Donald Trump Convention
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested Monday night and accused of an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he goes through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who sense the consequences of PTSD and the injury with which our soldiers return," she said to an audience at a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they came back a little differently, they came hardy back, they came back and wondered if there was respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and air forcemen and every other member of the army gave to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence and possessing a gun while under influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, DC. supports challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District Columbia support a legal challenge of a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims who flee gang or household violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the county put in a friend of the Court's order on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions proceedings which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August was not disclosed.
She said her mate "and his violent gangmen," mistreated her, but American officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produce a large number of US-Asian applicants, as nations who face in-depth gang and domestic violence problems.
The new US Asian policy reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigrants-Appèlle) in 2014 that allowed immigrants without the necessary documents fleeing from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Columbia's attorney general Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy "disciplines decaders' state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be determined on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such lawyer violates that policy," said the friend-of-the-court order.
Procurators further argued in the legal order that the policies that immigrants refuse access harm the U.S. economy and say it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "will provide necessary labor."
In June, attorney general Jeff Sessions commissioned immigration judges to stop allowing asylum to victims who fled from domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his announcement of policy on June 11.
Asiel was never meant to relieve all problems — even all serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly nagging.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old Ms. Risa Kusuma, consoling her feverous baby boy at an extermination center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute bring an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their devastated homes, seeking pervading possessions, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 - volume tremor, were overwhelmed.
Of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has contracted a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's army hospital where patients are treated outside because of constant strong aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he tells of the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-story hotel room, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the walls' ruins, I think," Haris said to Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
VS-ambassador accuses China of bullying with 'propaganda advertising'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American daily that praised the mutual benefits of U.S. China trade, the U.S. ambassador accused China Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily's paid inset in the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa's newspaper with most sales – after he accused China of interfering with the U.S. congress elections of November 6, a complaint that China denied.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections, marked what U.S. officials told Reuters, a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington is to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to post advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war that has led to their prize rounds equalizing each other's imports.
China’s retaliatory early in the commercial war had the purpose of beating exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the US-ambassador for China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a great exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "presuming now the bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seized America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, wrote Branstad.
"In contrast with that, at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing, one will find very limited deviant voices and not see any true reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people have about China's alarming economic trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers was shy away from the offer to publish his article," although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women's voters from inter-elections with Kavanaugh-debacle, warn analysts
While many top Republicans stand at Supreme Court nominated Board Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of various claims of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see opposition during the upcoming interim elections, especially of women.
The emotions over this are extremely high, and most Republicans are on record that they are already suggesting that they want to continue with the mood.
Those things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s incentive for an FBI investigation on the nipper would be enough to appease severe voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday—they won't forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters went on their way "November!" as they protested in the Senate entrance hall while the Republicans who had chosen the Justice Committee to continue with Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it was already high; that's true.
But it can be higher, especially among swing-voice female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public evidence that the details of her charge of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-geminated set out, analysts said an counter-reaction could follow if Republicans continued the confirmation.
"It became a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's voice or the final voice and whether Kavanaugh is put on the court, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, to the news channel.
But Americans seem slightly divided over who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, with slightly more who take their side.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe or probably Ford's evidence, while 35 says that they believe in Kavanaugh or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely jolted during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s provocation, the FBI is currently examining the accusations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainer, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed last week under oath before the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-geminated his sexual parts revealed to her while they attended a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new Internet to tell Google and Facebook the fight
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, led an initial business that tried to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open-source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea with Inrupt was "world domination."
"We must do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, job lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and relevant skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently consisting of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the personnel contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications by using the tools available on the Incrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about the introduction of a complete change whether, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a placement on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee turned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while piloting Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the World-wide web consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoriakrux-spiritual celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt.kol Reverend Bernard Vann gained the award on September 29, 1918, in the attack at Bellenglyse and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had gained the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic" that the stone is revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, lt.col. Vann on September 29, 1918 led his battalion over the Channel de Saint-Quentin "through many dense fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the fire line and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before he stormed a man-only combat rifle and knocked out three of the department.
Lt.koll Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions are "something I know I can never stand up, but something that's humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also lay a wreath at the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feel honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given by a lot of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, just not to be able to watch the main event.
The program of San Jose contained 13 battles, including six on the main program that would be broadcast directly by night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to say the fight to each other, viewers were stunned in the UK when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake especially for the battle until the early hours.
One supporter described on Twitter the transition to the child's cartoon as "one or other sick joke."
"It is government rules that the contents were not suitable at 6 p.m. and therefore they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communication, when he was asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think of the recast, I think we can probably figure out something," said Coker.
'But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it turned over, there were many text messages that were sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six – as we normally do – and we have tried to offer more to our adherents and have gone just over our time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's 'lessable' feeling about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with a feeling of inferiority about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't until he went to high school realized that "not everyone like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he had his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that to become a parent, had made him less concerned about winning at the Olympic Games.
The regular provider of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of illness.
When he appeared as a chagrin on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up, for "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "Until today, those feelings of less than, and feel otherwise, the real things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he wouldn't let anyone down when they would finally find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high profile LGBT player and has used his appearance at this year's State League games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he has made his feelings clear because he is so happy to be able to live openly without any consequences and wants to give other "hope".
The three-time world champion said that to fall in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "taken him stupid."
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who was 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference has never been a matter.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" -- he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later—he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said she was "whole perspective."
"If you asked my last year, everything went about 'I must win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after he has been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked if they had tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I only knew that it was what I had dreamed about for my life – to dive in front of my home country at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – who also resonated with him in building up the Olympic Games and still gives him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson did not drive and withdraw from Saturday’s Rider Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Rider Cup game, but he will have to manage his form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mikkelson, who plays for a record-12th time in the biennial event, was withdrawn from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball games and fours.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been to the United States, the five-time Major winner will divide his day in between to be race leader and work on the practice run at his game in the hope of correcting what has gone wrong.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the straightest driver, so the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National runway where the long ruins always punish the mischievous blows.
And as if the track on its own were not challenging enough, Mickelson came on Sunday in his ninth match against the accurate British Ope champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with newer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 single - game games well, Mickelson’s game can be absolutely essential.
Fury expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a knock on the back and put his arm around me and said he'd be right tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He is in the Heroesaal, and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t imagine he would play two games.
I put more ahead, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record on Sunday for the player who played most Ryder Cup games.
It can mark the end of a Ryderbekerloopbaan that never really corresponded to the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mikkelson had 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven halfs, although Furyk said that his presence had contributed inescapable aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, caught, likes to shave the crazy, and he's a wonderful old to have in the teamroom," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him crazy, who was fun to see.
He offers as much more than just game."
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjorn knows great advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advance before the last day's single game in the Ryderbeker can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 race at Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead, but only won nails with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"A person continues to remind himself that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, where we had lost, and at Valderrama, where we had won nails," said Bjorn, in the photograph, after he had watched the 2018 Class won 5-3 Friday and yesterday 10-6 before at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it is not over.
You're going to be full tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a purpose, and it is to try to win the trophy, and that is where the focus remains.
I still say, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side – the best players in the world."
Rejoicing at how his players sailed on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I'll never go ahead with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it is the individual participation that comes in turn, and it is a horse of a different color.
It is wonderful to be out there with a mate when things go well, but when you are there individually, you are tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to deliver to players, getting the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now leave your mate behind, and he must also draw the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Fury will want his players to do better individually than they did as playmates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three points from four.
Rowy himself had been turned around on both sides of that great last day, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe achieved the "wondering of Medinah".
"I remember every covert word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 gave his players courage on their way to that last day.
"We have 12 important contests tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as Brookline saw, as Medinah saw.
When that momentum begins in one direction, it puts much stress on those middle games.
We set up our team accordingly and divided the men we felt, you know, to us tomorrow will bring something magical."
Thomas was assigned to try the counterattack and compete in the main contest against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the top half of the classification.
"I have chosen this group of guys in this order, because I think it covers it to the end," said Bjorn about his single-game options.
Germany’s New Warship Retentioned
The German army’s newest frigate would have been put in service in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year, because of faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The entry into service of the "Rhineland-Pfalz", the chief ship of the brand new Baden-Wuertemberg-class frigate, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to The Time-curant who quotes a military spokesman.
This vessel must have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post delivery issues have plagued this ambitious project’s fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels that ordered the fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful canon, a battle order of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missions as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to develop the latest fragrants for up to two years away from homes.
But constant delays mean that the advanced warships, which will evidently enable Germany to project power overseas, will already be aged by the time they enter service, are called Die Zeit.
Last year, the disastrous F125-freight made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel in service and sent it back to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the Fleet sent a ship back to a ship builder.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned that a number of necessary "deepware and hardware defects" make the ship useless if it is developed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the manpower at older Bremen-class frigates.
It also revealed that the ship is heavily overweight, reducing the performance and reducing the fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" are thought to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price label for the entire project – including the training of the crew – also became a question.
It evidently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that the new frigates have bitten are especially important in view of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defense committee, admitted that the fleet's "ships that can be executed are getting out."
The official beaker said that the issue worsened over time, for old ships were put out of service, but no substitute vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wuertemberg-class could join the fleet.
National Trust Listens to Bats ’ Secret Life
New research is carried out on a estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help to lead future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano bat as well as the brown long ear and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special contractors will be placed on the property at important locations to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile recordings using hand indicators.
Expert-clonal channels of all recordings will check the regularity of the bat calls and determine which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS hope the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bat and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture creation and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly during the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as flying paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo orientation technique to show bugs and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [66,000 ha] of land throughout the country, are very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly perform surveys and sleeping - place inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threat estates in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten species of bat.
Land manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threate we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, very veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the necessity of looking for bats for preservation in property being done because it is possible that unwitting destruction of a single birthplace can mean to 400 females and young children's death and can eradicate an entire local population.
Bats are protected, and they are illegal to kill, disturb, or prevent or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo concludes rape claims while lawyers are preparing to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo dismissed rape claims against him as "false news" and said that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The Portugal and Juventus predecessor was accused of raping an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in 2009 at a Las Vegas hotel.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, reported Der Spiegel Friday.
In an Instagram live video in which he addresses his 142 million followers, hours after the claims were published, Ronaldo, 33, finished the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything's right," the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo's attorney is preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the claim, which, according to Reuters, they called "unallowable reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy".
Procurator Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral damages for any amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged resident reportedly took place in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he supposedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo after the alleged incident fell on his knees and said he was "99 percent" an "good old" who was abandoned by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken photographs of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside the court because she was "fang for retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she wants to reverse the settlement now because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged assault on the point to join from Manchester United at Real Madrid and moved this summer, in a €100 million agreement to the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: UK will lose this 'for ever repentance' when their car manufacturers
The UK 'will regret it forever' when they lost their status as world leader in car production to Brexit, said Company Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "thinking" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily have to stop production at the Burnston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a gene agreement-Brext, could cost posts.
Last year, the Burnston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see how production is stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed fears about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade would function.
BMW, for example, said that they would close their mini-legging in Oxford for a month to Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "net-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on-order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruption on the border that the industry says can lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be discontinued.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "just calibrated to avoid those border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only to enjoy the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what was a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped but warned that in the long run, added costs could reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost posts.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnston for 24 years and the Unite-unie's collaborator at the facility, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says Withuis
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with adjunct attorney-general Rod Rosenstein can be "exposed by another week" while the fights over nominated for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian electoral interference, links between Trump-helpers and Russia, and possible cross-bombing of the law by the president.
Whether Trump is going to cancel or not the deputy attorney general, and thereby threatens Mueller’s independence, Washington’s gossip has been inciting for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a recorder to consult Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the account.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to quit.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not" to thank Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate court's trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who charged him with sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh and further postponed the full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting she said: "A date for it has not yet been determined; it may be this week; I can see that it is postponed with another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we shall see, and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would disagree with that statement: Sanders has not kept a White House press information session since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of information sessions is not due to a reluctance to TV journalists who are "effekschap", although she said, "I won't argue with the fact that they're doing good."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president held more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, and added without quoting evidence: "We have looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, then it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do it a lot and you've seen us do it a lot over the past few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press releases are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbounded and at times, bizarre appearance before journalists gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to show the country’s gratitude and express the wish that they will continue to Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued on the road to expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also intensified its preparations for a possible no agreement scenario.
I know it is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat how much I value each staff member’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service’s work, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' liner Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he suffered a major injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee-span Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State chief coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the margin and sort of just there collapsed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the margin before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
An officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still no details of the type/range of injury, and Tennessee continues to try to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He killed Saturday five times before he left the game, bringing his total to the season at 18 deaths.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK and using the extra cash to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to draw young voters
The seal tax will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The The Thesourie expects to collect up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay UK taxes, with the extra money that will help government plans to combat homelessness.
The extra tax – apart from the current seal tax, including the higher levels set up two years ago on second houses and houses purchased to rent – can be as much as three percent.
The The Thesourie expects that this move could bring in up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London auctions are purchased by non-UK citizens who raise the prices and make it harder for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "spook towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in seal tax to help more young people to own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of holding up property prices by confiscating land, but not using it, encouraging Mrs. May to give up quota on affordable homes to repair Britain’s "dwelling disaster".
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of proposed housing improvements, including rental management and an end to "no error-dispositions".
He also wants to give more powers to race to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I will devote my prime ministership to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And it means repairing our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work, and build a life.
But it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as well as foreign - based companies to buy homes as for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has become a disparaging dream and the humiliation of homelessness has become too great a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at one point.
The Scots, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life into the North East team, which is currently in third place in Liga One, three points below the tops.
He moved this summer to the Stadium of Light after returning last season to the Scottish Premiership.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I took the second team, but it was already," Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sports Sound.
"But as a child I often looked with my father at Scotland at Hampden and it was something that drew me back.
The opportunity, however, can come only if I succeed in club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no anxiety to imitate such established names at such a large club, after he had previously rejected presentations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
'At the moment success will be measured for me by 'Can I have this club returned to the Premier-liga?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it must belong in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably only consider myself successful if I can get the club out again."
Ross's career in the management is only three years, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' coach staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third liga and St Mirren from the edge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a true crossroads," he said when he thought about how he took over Alloa's guides.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds like Bisar, because I did good enough, made a reasonable existence out of it, and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things through which a person has to come weekly.
I’m still going through the stress and stress of the job, but driving just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my adult life."
You can listen to the full radio interview on Scotland on Sunday, September 30 between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, found.
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s struggling bars ’ income but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and pubs saw sales rise by 2.7% in July – but revenue in restaurants was down by 4.8 percent, showed figures.
Peter Martin, of commercial consultation firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a pattern similar to that of the previous month, June, when drinking places were at 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even heavier.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only increased in July.
Dranque-guided drinking places and bars did far better and rose more than restaurants had done.
Food-guided drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Drived bars and drinking places have increased sales by 6.6 percent for the month, with food being down by three percent."
Paul Newman, of recreation and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the tendency we have seen since the end of April.
Again and the impact of major social or sporting events remains the biggest factors when it comes to selling in the out-of-house-out market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 percent years a year will be particularly difficult above and above constant expenses.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-guided operators and only the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring needed relief."
Total growth in sales throughout drinking sites and restaurants, including new places that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowing down in trademark announcements.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – has secret social media accounts that hide them from their parents and teachers, reveal a survey
Recording of 20,000 high school students has revealed an increase in false Insta pages
The news has raised fears that sexual content is placed
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main account" to show parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – creates social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" – a reference to the photo division Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is placed.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main account" to show parents but also had private accounts.
One mother who came down at her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager who encouraged others to "rape."
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Head Mistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, has found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of those who admit that they have private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot locate them."
Elith Doyle will be "vote for athletes" on Scottish athletic board.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the council of Scottish athletics as a non-executive director at the management body's general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her far-reaching experience at international level during the past decade.
"Elidh has great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and world athletic society and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from what she brings to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm eager to vote for athletes and hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The Americans, who had 200 m and 400 m at the 1996 Games in Atlanta under his four golden Olympic medals, were now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after having had a momentary ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but it recovered completely, learned again how to walk, and exercise dexterity today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Chest pump advertising comparable to cows divide opinions online
A pump company divided opinions online with an advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers to cows being milked.
To celebrate the piloting of what is called the "world's first silent portable breast pump," consumption technology company Elvie has released a tongue-in-the-chosen music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the pump gives to mothers who milk.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of straw and cows on the measure of a song that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't seen, it's not udders, it's my breasts."
The choir section reads: "Put it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page caused online controversy.
With 77,000 watches and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reaction from viewers, with many who say it underplays the "greys" of the dairy industry.
"Many poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Never should we get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies often become within days of giving birth, stolen from them," wrote one.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreet in a nutrient (Elvie/Mother)
Another observed: "Conceptably traumatic for mother and baby.
But why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The advertisement is so out of touch."
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman who admitted that the song was "screaming nakeds" for her.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I were still breast - feeding.
To milk out made me feel just like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I have accepted it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Still someone remarked: "It's a pleasant advertisement directed at mothers who feel milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and like "coo."
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is still, has no threads or tubes, and fits discreet in a nutrient that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while milking.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD by Mother observed: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a large and provocative release.
By drawing a parallel between women who were milking and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking process and all its challenges in the colliery, while we found the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has brought the news.
During London Modeweek, a mother of two appeared on the board for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrants quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of persistent migrant children has risen sharply although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because of fierce rhetoric and policies set up by the Trump administration that make it harder to place children at bail.
Traditionally, most deposits were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country was put at risk by stepping forward to demand a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that possible guarantees and other adult members of their households would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at immigration and customs maintenance at the Congress, witnessed that the agency arrested thousands of people who applied to sponsor unspoiled minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Amper 80 percent of the individuals who are depositors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a lot of them are criminal foreigners.
That is why we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albumence.
In an attempt to process the children faster, officials have introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month after detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to advocate their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those considered unfit for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, leading to violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates say those concerns are raised at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child struggles are more easily overlooked due to the size.
They added that moving the children to the village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good - bye to friends can aggravate the trauma that many have already struggled with.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish ‘conventional forces’ to withdraw immediately
When addressing the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moulem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces were illegal on Syrian grounds, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and would be "handling accordingly".
"They must immediately withdraw and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moulem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with still millions more uprooted, are "almost over".
He said Damascus would continue "to fight this holy battle until we purified all Syrian territories" of both terror groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States trained and advised some 2,000 troops in Syria, who mostly opposed Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn land.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Moulem said that the conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to fascinate this return," he said.
"They politicize something that simply must be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats have said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel fortress of Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement turned down a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, emphasized that the agreement had "explained sperties" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-connected Nusra Front who would be "nursed out".
UN Secretary, Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moulem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to "searching for the articles of the present constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusation and scandals will end his presidency early.
In which no doubt "the most dramatic finale of a precedent will ever be!"
To date, there are no signs of sighting fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-time viewing rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak time viewers, at 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is at the top of cable viewers with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"It's a fire to which people are attracted, because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who became president after an attack destroyed the Congress House.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaching Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "For he makes me laugh," Scovel told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story lines coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and the health of the world economy.
To turn off is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
And yet it goes beyond being just an informed citizen when you are in the sixth hour of it to watch a panel of experts debate about Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather-fly jacket ("a garment thick of the humris," said The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I would never again look at Super Mario in the same way.
"Something he does that makes it feel like a reality program, is that he carries you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief of business at Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's variable role sharing and daily kinsels in the plot (such as looking for argument with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un to commend).
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you stay behind.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not tear himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh was on his way to appear before the Senate’s Court of Justice and the future of the Supreme Court that hangs in the balances.
"I remember when we did all that crazy programs then and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seemed now they were right."

Foreign money streaming to the most exciting mid-term election rounds in the house
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th saw an influx of money, due to a shift of congress districts that two officers now had to end up in a race for the same seat.
The recently changed suburbs of Pittsburg-district lets Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – measure forces.
Lamb stands against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th.
The cards were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January determined that the old districts were unconstitutionally demarcated in the Republicans ’ favor.
The race in the new 17th took off with a campaign finance competition between the large parties ’ financial legs, the Democratic Veldgog’s Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Veldgog committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a navel scratch won in a wide-spected special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congress.
The seat was held for more than a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the county with 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
US was considering rebalancing El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but then diverting back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners disfellowshipped the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the state departments decided to call the U.S. leaders back from diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "unlong decisions not to recognize Taiwan any more", said Heather Nauert, the department’s spokesman, earlier this month in a statement.
However, fines were only considered against El Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug management, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including reduction in financial assistance and compromising visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar convention last year that was considered a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the congress to continue to effectively put an end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now destined to address the congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new heavy messages or heavy messages from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also talked about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that can happen may be the special discussion on Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible cross - bounding of the law, of which there is now much significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also thought to focus his investigation on whether Trump’s campaign with Russia worked in the country’s attack on our elections.
Would the Congress pass into other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face responsibility in that body, just when he prepared to go again before the voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peer group.
It's a lot of axes, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – nor is that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the extent to which the battle can be stretched out.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, if the West only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia-Slovake at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and democracy’s unrelenting course is hastened or delayed.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What will we do if Mr Trump adjunct attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who rejects the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been in hot water since this newspaper reported that last year he had proposed taking the president secretly and speculating on it whether he was competent for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times’s report is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the inter-election for a convention that will hold him responsible for Mr. Trump?
If we watch those tests, there's a long winter ahead of democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that lived in my ambassador's home at a time.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to go to light Sabbath candles on that table carrying the swastika.
With that as my coming back, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans optimism for Rapid Vienna Battle
Rangers play Thursday hosts for Rapid Vienna knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive equinox in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury has prevented midfield player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2-2-equipment against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this rash as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the contest with the conviction that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Perhaps we could have won it at the end, but a draw is probably a righteous outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another great European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult match, because they had a good result in their last match, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can get a positive result.
Last year was certainly hard, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but now there's a good feeling factor in the place.
The group is good, and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can now press, sit behind us last season, and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this retirement pairing fear
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a relative to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here is where to start.
Talk to your husband and the children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes long in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to explain where and how to receive care, since those choices may be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor in: Your advisor can also help you to come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-assurance with your own abilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut down legal battles at the pace.
Get a health-care proxy in place so you can instruct a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that experts comply with your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, your finances by your agents.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incompetent.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play those details out in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues involved, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is the medication?
Who will care for the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot windbucked several times in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a windbuck as he walked home to an evening out.
The victim, in his 40's, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as an "precious act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not life - threatening, and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officers said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communication put out of action, relief officials could not get any information from Donggala Regentship, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5-range tremor.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a rainfall stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in northwest Sulawesi Island.
The Regentship, an administrative region under a province, had a estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of Central Sulawesi's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but is mostly concentrated in Marrowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times during the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A Tsunami also struck west Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly struck by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A great tremor along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, which led to a tsunami that struck 14 countries, led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong tremors hit the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: a 6.8-range hit the south of Java, Indonesia was most populated island, which led to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-range quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-range tremor struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozen villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A level tremor struck the Pidie Jaya Regentship in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly tremor and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 died from buildings that fell down,
2018: Great tremors hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and opposition against arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took a female knowledge phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pre-trial Facility and is held on a $500 unsecured deposit, reports KTU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, certain" when asked what he pleaded, reported the network.
Palin stared three class A offenses in the face, which means he can be locked up for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offense, punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal complaints against Palin have been made.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case now serves before Alaska’s Veteranehof.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possessing a gun while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girl claimed to have boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran groups after connecting her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of his military service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake Tsunami: Hundreds Dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-range earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks were put out of action with mortality rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck outside central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that shows the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered together for a beach festival in the city of Palu, when the tsunami struck the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspects in NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death sentence for Sayfulllo Saipov, the suspects in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not yet been executed in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side highway in Laer Manhattan to reap pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his path in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "willfully" killed the eight victims and "willfully" committed serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intention to ask for the death penalty, lodged in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal great jury beat Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for extortion, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "difficult planning and predicament", claimed prosecutors and described the way Saipov carried it out as "absorbable, cruel and perverted."
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov has injured, damaged and lost to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, run Ferruchi, run Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco caused," mentioned the intent notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York legally persecuted a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug providers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple killed after being sentenced to a plot to carry out spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were put to death with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He mentioned to detectives that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded innocently for the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federals pro Deo-Advocates representing Saipov, said that they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to covet the death penalty rather than to accept a debt-recognition to life imprisonment with no possible release, only the trauma of these events will extend to all those involved." said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked persecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in control of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilise "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to feel the "heat" of Euroskeptics – since one of Theresa May's own LPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conserative rear banker Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that by the time the UK was "to be out" if Mr. Farage Brexit secretary was.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faced was to unite her deep-divided officers by pro-Roman Torians pointed out by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan in the midst of attacks by Brexites, Remainers and the EU.
Associates insisted that she pressured her door in her attempt to agree with Brussels in spite of the death – and forced Euroskeptics and Labor to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone told the Loop Label Loop convention in Solihull that he wanted to smear out "Chequers."
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been made a nobleman and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in control, we would have been out by now,' he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added: 'I'll get up for Brexit, but we must smear Chequers.'
He outlined his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone declined suggestions that since the 2016-story change in public opinion: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain completely untrue.’
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and told reporters: ‘ I simply say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘ Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually bombard the streets and make sure that we are chosen in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening.'
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: ‘First ministers should keep their work when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farge reported that the convention politicians had to feel the "heat" if they were on the threshold to want to violate the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'It's about a matter of confidence between us--the people--and our political class," he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we won't get away with it'.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘ I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
'We mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and won't rest until we're an independent, self-regulating, proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a convention for two hours in the city center.
A few activists waved Tories against Brexit banners after the release of the group this weekend.
Laborer Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application such as the conference opened.
‘It is the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,’ he added.
'It's a total craze.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to ‘look hard’ to stand for president
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she will "look hard to stand for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts democrat spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular criticism by President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP states Rep Geoff Diehl who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the middle of speculation that she may challenge Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump was in power.
An attendee asked her if she was planning to stand for president.
Warren answered that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and it closes in a woman at the top."
Arrestation made in shooting death of LSU’s Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA., announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET News Conference.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was seen in the image material.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in the head and was finally killed as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on 247 sports on Saturday.
Wayde entered to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene, possessed of a weapon, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 younger who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 leads last season and maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 backballs per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton rings world title after team orders gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became evident the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday before Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes's team orders would play a major role in the race.
From stake position, Bottas had a good beginning and almost won for Hamilton as he had defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Fattel first entered the wells and left Hamilton to drive into the traffic at the back of the bundle, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes found a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead of wheel-to-wheel action that the Ferrari driver reluctantly risked--freely left the interior at risk of endurance after a double-movement to defend at the third angle.
Max Verstappen started from the back row from the leaper and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large portion of the race as he held on to his tires to finish quickly and pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have come into the wells on the 44th round but could not accelerate his pace in the remaining eight rounds, since Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri did fantastically all weekend and was a true sir.
The team did extraordinary work to have a one-two," Hamilton said.
It was remorseful bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Saturday at a convention Senator Dianne Feinstein about her insistence that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused Supreme Court-gemominated Board Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the evidence that Ford had given before the Senate Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "congregation and rude and liars."
"The one thing that might happen and the lovely thing that has happened in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and lexies and then they say "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lick?
Remember her answer... did you lick the document--"O, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't lick it," he added, in a presupposition of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that outlined the accusations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it had been leaked earlier in September--but Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges. I didn't lick her story," told Feinstein to the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not consider her denial well and commented during Saturday evening's convention: "I tell you what. It was quite bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominated by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the Democrats use the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back any necessary means.
You see the common, the unhonority, they don't care who hurts them, who they have to get around for power and control," Mediate reported the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two targets for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday’s Elite League’s loss against Belfast Giants by winning the contest 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-purpose lead by throwing from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team together before Dwyer restored the Giants ’ direction.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee together before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals captured their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who had once lost games and then won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth gathering of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's openball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull help, with David Rutherford who offered the help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan put the home team back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took direction into the first break when he threw his second purpose of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again got their draw with a power game goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran stood together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half and made sure of the win with his team’s fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants who now lost four of their last five games are at home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on aircraft can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered to be a hero after he died when he made sure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people rose up safely.
More than 800 people were dead and more were missing after a great earthquake on Friday hit the island of Sulawesi, and caused a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many are trapped in breakdowns in the city of Palu.
But in spite of his colleagues who fled from their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower, which waved heavily on the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained unmovable to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, was able to climb safely.
He then jumped down from the traffic control tower when he day was tumbling.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation spokesperson Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before helicopter Palu reached.
"Our hearts break to hear of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster - control agency that says that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll continues to rise, as many corpses are still under the ruins while many can't yet be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching up to six feet [6 m], Palu pulled that would hold a mass funeral Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance's body brings in.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini brand is being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military service: "I ask AlmaI of you to work day and night to complete every task related to escape.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was struck by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is missing after lagoon aircraft crash
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach in Micronesia says now that one man was missing after they had said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had safely cleared the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not render an account of a male passenger.
The airline said that they work with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in a stable state.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane landed near the runway in the beach.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had come in very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to walk through deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the air guards panicked and shouted and that he had suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that ships working close to improving a key also helped with a blow-up boat with the rescue to find people on land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have been killed in breakdowns of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini was involved in one.
Analists set timeline from night that woman was burned alive
The state closed his case on Saturday in the rehearsing of a man charged that he had burned a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice-analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile records to assemble the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from different cell phones showing that Tellis was together Chambers the night of her death, in contradiction with his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's trek that night, Sanford said "jok, because my move was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls and contact information were erased from his phone.
"He must have put her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense was made to begin its closing vows Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genres by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop moved away from its origin of political messages and the approach to social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fuges and Common have seen a recent rise in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
NY-child-juffrou suede couple because she was fired after "racist" text.
A New York-children's boy sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misrepresented message from the mother who complained that she was still a black person.
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the dispute to "exortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, made her upset when she found out that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first workday in 2016.
"NEEEEEEE NÓG A SWART PERSOON," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she twice sent it to me Maurice.
After she found out her mistake, an "unfortunate" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed me Maurice and said that their outgoing child-boy who was African-American did bad work and that she had expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damages over the cancellation and seeks his damages up to the sum of $350 a day for the six months, resident job for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such good," she told the Post on Friday and added "I know it's discrimination."
Returning to the claims that they were racial, the couple said that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice’s employment and feared that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said husband Joel Plasco the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even if it were by a tube?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the matter to "exortion" and said that his wife would have had a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going after such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
As the case continued, the court of public opinion was quick to bring the couple on social media and cut them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not relate to readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It is very entertaining that we know of Paddington's great success."
She said that her father would have been fiery if his job had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's announcement after his death was "bitter sweet."
About Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was silently proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an apple-grained man," she said.
"But because Paddington was genuine to him, it was almost as if a child had achieved something: you're proud of them, even if it wasn't your job.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success as a kind of that way.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hi over the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was hunted for Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2-hospital, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, heart lamb.
Soon I will be with you.
I'll be with you.
The medicine the doctors gave her to keep her heart knocking was slowly getting out and leaving her system.
She was a while before it died and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there waiting, knowing that it unfolded.
I couldn't turn or scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who by this time was hurt for the loss of her daughter, went on board with the other passengers--unconscious of the trial she had gone appreciated.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head lowered and tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I got an overwhelming sympathetic feeling for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Mourning women mail cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work at preventing others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys mail cards for a while on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis’ son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I want no parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said that her son was a promising thief with a contagious smile.
"All knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile had brightened any room."
However, he gave up work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11, found his brother after taking his own life.
Me Davis said, "I'm still worried that there's going to be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there who you can go to and whom you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence. You need to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas Day--when the children opened their gifts, he did not make eye contact or something with them."
She said his death was very traumatic to them, but that they had to work through it: "It's time a hole through the family.
It tears us apart.
But we must all go and fight."

Board Kavanaugh’s future was still undecided as FBI began to investigate
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he had asked for--a timeless investigation that had no cover--could we bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was "falling apart" under entrenched partisan pile.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is all because of timing.
The intermediate choices are only weeks away, on November 6, if, as is expected, the Republicans fare badly, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to have elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House, who met his wife Ashley, and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has produced his report?
There will be a voting in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's not clear yet whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes on the Senate floor which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a draw and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea Overrun Number Down Under Kim
The number of North Korean errands to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Beeong-seug quoted data from the South Unification Cabinet and said there were 1,127 survivors last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher rates asked for by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of errands from the North are finally offered South Korea-Bürgerrecht.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flight through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zones (DMS) between the two Koreans.
Instead of refugees, Shina often treats the perpetrators as illegal immigrants and repatriates them with violence.
Links between the North and the South who are still technically involved in war with each other - have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for conversations centering around the stagnant negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has blamed US sanctions on Saturday for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histerical," he says he is incompetent to serve in the Supreme Court.
Home minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court-designated Board Kavanaugh "histerical" and said that he was spiritually incompetent to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever acted this way, they would say 'histeries'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate-right Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally that he had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost yelled and jolted as he discussed his family and his high school for years.
He also expressly disapproved of democrats on the committee and called the claims against him a "laughter and coordinated character hit" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s evidence proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, as it showed that he had been prejudiced against democrats.
"I think he's making himself incompetent with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if democrats won the majority in the House of Commons.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not competent to be in the Supreme Court, but to be in court at which he is currently," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Ommegang Appèlhof.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Taxable Sorg Act or Roe v. Wade since he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh passed questions as to whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women have to handle it.
It is a righteous diatribe, months and years' anger that boils up, and she can't get it out without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said that she was crying when she got angry, but a technique had developed that meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she would say to the person she spoke to, "You might think that I was sad because I cried.
I am angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for bridle because they are fundamentally misunderstanding.
One of my sharpest memories of an early work in a masculine-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with nameless anger and being grabbed by an older woman at my neck,--a cold manager for whom I was a little afraid--who dragged me into a report.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad and will be happy because they have affected you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congresswoman from Kolorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in an out-marital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the race, Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not examine the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she said to me laughingly 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snowy and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with find collections and so she vowed that she would not enter the race unless she had collected $2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Does they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not conduct a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions--thankful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to target voters rather than partial holes, and angry for sexism--that she strangled.
You would have thought that I had a nervous breakdown," repeated me Schroeder on how the press responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"She's crying?"
How the US-China Trade War may be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the trade war between the US and Shina was deafening and while the struggle was far from over, a disunity between the countries might in the long run beneficial to Beijing, says experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning earlier this year by loading important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most interesting escalation rolled in this week with new rates that affect $200 billion ($150 billion) items and effectively burdened half of the goods that come into the US from China.
Beijing has been avenged each time in goods and has recently slapped rates of from five to ten percent on $60 billion U.S. goods.
Shina has promised to match the U.S. lap-by-shot and the world's largest economy is not about to move.
To get Washington to stand back means to surrender to requests, but to meet the US's requests publicly will be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, Shina's president.
Experts still say that if Beijing is playing its cards correctly, pressure over US trade war over long - term China can be positively supported by lowering the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a rapid political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that an economic toll can begin in any one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have already confessed," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant who focuses on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria ‘ready’ for refugees to return, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and calls for help to rebuild the land that was destroyed by war for more than seven years.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country improve.
"Today, the situation at ground level is more stable and secure due to progress in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore to normal the areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the one - sided economic measures that served their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian people have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people who still live in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the flat - sanded land.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the invasion.
Europe sealed Ryder cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and Team U.S.A. won with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe got the crown back when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team got the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
US-State Phil Mickelson, who had struggled for most of the tournament, had his T-keep in the water at the par-3 16th hole and gave up his game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds and became one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the present tournament started in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Oles of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell to land Poultry of England who might have played in his final Ryder cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament’s European winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a rough year.
So grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so glad to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the torch over to his fellow countryman John Ram who won US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
The incredible pride I feel, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that old one," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his competitions in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 runway Ryder-Bekerord.
A strange statistics by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team U.S.A. has struggled all weekend to find the clean field, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team: "I'm proud of these guys. They fought.
There was time this morning when we put some heat on Europe.
We deleted.
Cute off for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder berth, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You need to keep your hat down.
We're outnumbered."
