No liberating novel for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused the request to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been sentenced in the context of a novelle of the criminal code.
At the second reading of the request for a reduction in the penalties for economic offences, the new regime which could have opened the way for the release of the ex-principle arrested could have been rejected.
In October, Timoshenko had been sentenced to seven years in prison for the conclusion of an alleged adverse contract with Russia about the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet legally binding, and the appeal of the convicted is to be negotiated before the court in December.
Timoshenko himself describes the judgment as a political revenge of the regime and also in the West the trial raised the suspicion of the prejudice of the court.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the ex-primary minister was sentenced to remove from the criminal code, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for adoption.
Libyan Victory
The story of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As this region used to win in the elections Islamists, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council is known for the habit of the Sharpia, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would be a country without crime, because for theft you hack your hand in short.
Women should also forget about emancipation as soon as possible, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will in future be united by the Qur'an from intervening tribes.
In short - in Libya, there will be an order that would hardly be imaginable in this country and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively not the best either and would hardly match the above-mentioned Libyans.
So it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were at all helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To their excuse, it is only the fact that NATO's air attacks were not directed by any general from America but by Allah himself, whose power was praised after every successful hit.
The winner in Libya isn't part of the West.
We only participated in a shooting shift, served the interests of Islam and our politicians escaped in the person of the dictator of a political ally without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the Hiesigen are a concern - the exaggeration of the cruisers.
But do the mineral oil companies also get the black gold at the spot price without decommissioning?
It is hardly possible and so the West can at last rightly boast of its selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If this is not done to them by the people of the Sharī, then they will be destroyed.
Start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm low was brewing across Europe.
The individual countries published their GDP data for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France.
However, the bond market today breaks all records.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Europe Area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, as expected by France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded higher growth than was originally expected (increasing by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France granted a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, the gross domestic product stagnated, and according to the statistical office, the trend in growth slowing economic performance was thus confirmed.
So the results are worse than what the analysts predict.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to provisional and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the euro area and in the EU, the economy increased by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The return on their 10-year government bonds was 28.45%.
The yield of Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, although the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, voices become loud, the ECB should become creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the hardest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-stocked Čech goalkeeper and a magnificent gate of Petr Jiráček, she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, the Czech football could thus defend its luxurious advantage from the home game and will once again not be missing at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascent game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a giant portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won quite happily 1:0 thanks to the closing weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and has thus redeemed her ticket for the football EM.
Also because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, they put Montenegriners under more pressure in the second half of the year.
The pitchers of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant odds.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech Czech selection will join the European Championships next year, it is also pleasant that local football will be awarded a premium of about 200 million.
From the first minutes was played quite combative football.
Both teams combined for a long time and were played mainly around the middle line.
In the second half of the year, the pressure of the domestic team remained out of hand and the large cuts before the criminal court were successfully rejected by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are willing to die for the core programme of their country.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the core programme of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object Tuesday noon and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
On Tuesday, a few hundred students from the University of Isfahan formed a lively shield around the nuclear technology centre in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
In doing so, they wanted to know that they are willing to protect the core programme of their country, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran had not abandoned everything it seems to have given up on a nuclear weapon.
In Israel too, there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students had prayed to the complex at noon before the entrance and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at making the Iranian nuclear programme largely lame, the Israeli press would also be the nuclear enrichment plant in Nathan's attack target from the center in Isfahan.
The menu of a obese child: It does not breakfast and eats to the evening bread sausage
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all pupils being overweight and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have been conducted - adipous children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important it is for a person's healthy development to be the environment in which he grows up and is the examples surrounding him.
On the tables of adipous children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families where normal-weighted children live.
More than 19 per cent of the overweight children had in the morning of the Enlightenment Action under the motto "Adipositas is not a coincidence" Pommes for the evening bread.
In families with thickets sport is also not just one of the favourite jobs, but also the majority of today's students - only 15 percent answered that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children being interviewed from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Hospital and the Society Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarmingly increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed, for example, suggested five times a day in the breakfast-second breakfast-coffee-vesper-abendbrot mode - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner bread
Experts point out that relative small things, such as the family's regular breakfast time, are important for a child's healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the pupils' families had breakfast.
And - in most families everyone eats on their own.
The worst was the finding that every 10th family does not eat at all.
Breakfast is considered the foundation of healthy daily diet.
The survey showed, among other things, that in the families of overweight children, there is a lot of healthy pommes to be consumed.
And almost everyone - without regard to weight - drinks sweet sodas every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed drive sports, only less than half of their parents do so - that is, only 15 percent.
Make your own menu
A further part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to put together their own menu from the possibilities offered by appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer in diet between 12 and 15 is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many meals, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Alert is, above all, the great popularity of sweet sodas", is stressed in the final report on this survey.
During lunch, that is, the main dish, doughware was about to win off poultry.
The children almost didn't like fruit and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very small.
Return to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get proper information.
"In the control group of the survey participants who completed the questionnaire "Adipositas is not a coincidence" a significant shift in preferences to principles of healthy nutrition was in many cases mentioned in the results of the project.
This was obvious, for example, with the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed a lot of common poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were ready to eat less noodles or sweet food.
Pros claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I had a bit of a taste that was a bit too much fabric for the beginning.
I didn't know what's still coming.
Talks by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how this is going "on the square".
It's supposed to be worse.
The closer the test moves, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is nevertheless fully occupied.
This time we debated with Director Alena (in the course no single man participates) how to attract a woman who has no ideal proportioned figure.
And that's most of us.
One has too short a neck, the other one too young a figure without proper curves and again others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually cascade wide shoulders, extend the neck or create the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a type of woman like Jennifer Lopez - i.e. with big busses, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure beet without it being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so big that the skirt or pants really don't fit, at least one piece should be cut by measure.
You probably won't regret that, because good-sitting clothes are simply innumerable.
In such a tailor-made skirt one feels much better than in one of the rod, which is always too high and slipping, in which waist is placed, etc.
In turn, young figures can allow themselves to wear clothing with folds, blocks, applications, embroiderys or rafting.
With this lot of information and figure types, I'm glad I have a whole week of getting everything through my head thoroughly.
And yet, I'm afraid it's almost impossible to do it in the face of the house assignment.
Each of the students was assigned a promotion for which she should design suitable outfits - daywear and evening robe.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "put on" Miranda Kerr, which you might know from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the inner I juggle, because this is a lot better for me personally than to dress Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to the hundred kilos in recent times (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We are supposed to cut out the clothes from magazines or search the Internet, print them out and then process them graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, then our very personal style and relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is also very important to think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models physically but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday presentation filled with information on figure types was immediately seasoned by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, by the fashion creator Jakub Polanka and by the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion illusion is and that a stylist should be able to use it.
And a smart stylist can work with a single garment in a very different way.
The magic word is variable.
For example, you can wear a Trenchcoat as usual over the jeans, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear hen shoes and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to pull up the sleeves or collars and right now the whole look looks completely different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of the advice came to me: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then will you have to hurt her," Jakub said.
Finally, I realize why we need to pause all these courses, what can be combined with what and why, even if you often get to see something else in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten sides (spray ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to expect to design the outfit with all of this.
That image and style sometimes make up half of the success, that also confirmed us Jan Pokorný.
There you only need Madonna to watch a brilliant singer from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Also well-known personalities think this is often for emphasised money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look is secondary).
And if any of us can already be styled, we should expect him or her to force us with great probability a very different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google to verify with certainty that the boulevardpresse writes, the corresponding promi has taken back to or off, etc.
Jan and Mario put us to the heart on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then the outfit needs to be "constructed".
In his work, he must communicate primarily with the people he styles and he must be a dedicated psychologist.
People estimated without offering themselves and in his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to see her wardrobe and to add pretty pieces, then we can't clear her all the closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"At least you have to find some praiseworthy things to recommend what you can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what such a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So this is a bag that you can use on the waist and in which you carry all the necessary proprieties.
In addition to such clear things as shears, rollers for removing hair or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (this helps the stylist to photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are pulled in the back, if it is too large (snacks or other terminals are forbidden, so that the fabric is not broken) and, of course, sewing.
But in order not only to listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to put shoes under properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is just, one can damage the shoe sole, let alone the outside.
We've been sticking and sticking...
With the scissors one must not even touch the shoes so that they are not damaged.
So you really have to proceed skillfully.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without any restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was only the fraction of what we got to hear on the second weekend course.
One thing has become clear to me - devoting to styling at a professional level is not a child's play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original carefree ride is made by a series of completely avoidable, diletant errors to the early shift routine.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions in a large part, what does it do, if obviously no one wanted to do a little more?
Even before he came to the store tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
After all, he promised to move the already-year-old game series "Take for Speed" once again into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the way the inserted passages occur, where the main protagonist rises out of the car and continues walking.
But as one is already used at NFS, in the end effect is much different than one expected.
Safe - potentially it is quite decent arcade race, but overall the game is reduced by some superfluous errors that are present in this series for more or less than a few years.
So it's not really any more mistakes, but rather signs of an inconceivable flaw of game developers in principle.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, the story is introduced, whose main character Jack has some personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and into more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is performed on a different route and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have a moment's impression that game would always offer the same.
Some environments are still very nice to see, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So there's nothing world moving.
But the journey through the desert, through autumn landscape or up high through deep snowy landscape looks very pleasant.
Time and again, untypical elements bring a little variety into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that greatly limits the view.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to be careful not to be shaken by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in the back of each other.
Just a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overcome the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classical race against the stopwatch), then expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
And that's what's going on with the cops who want to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations where Jack flies from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer passages in the game than one would expect (in fact only three).
Finally, this is more of an advantage, because at least this element has no chance of getting bored - it belongs in context to the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model goes into the feet of the preceding parts.
That is, seen from today's point of view, it doesn't rip out trees, on the other hand it could not be claimed that it would be bad.
Those looking for realistic simulations have to look elsewhere.
But an action-charged racing race will continue to live up to the local driving model, even though you could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems occur only after some time.
Contrary to the driving model, the collision model is not quite O.K.
A game of this kind is hardly expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no impact on any object as the car behaves, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: When overcoming or pre-fading on counter-cars, in some places the other car is only easy, but in other, almost identical situation one comes to sleep and rotates wild pirouettes.
Or the car's heading straight to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, this doesn't matter anymore, as a matter of fact it's all angry.
The reboots are so solved: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then one throws the game back at the last point of the track.
Only - in every race you only have five reboots.
If you've exhausted them, everything's going to go out front.
So the reboots are more like a tool, in case something doesn't succeed, but one should not rely on it.
Sometimes however, the restart does not even help, as nothing else helps to learn the critical section from the head.
It is very unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, you have to go through some curves in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't fit through.
Otherwise you always meet "civil" cars in the same configuration at the appropriate point, no matter if you come as first or fifth, five seconds sooner or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see that the contrahent comes by before a playing on two opposite cars, but until you arrive there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to bypass them or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you arrive, because everything is designed so that it always comes close to your nose to this situation.
The opponents have additional advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you are always at the same place left by the same opponent and also here again without regard to the time.
This is the most crazy thing to do at the end of the game on the long bridge that is happening in the opposite direction.
The opponent obviously has to get one out of here on a devil.
And if he's already in front of one of them, he takes the view, of course, so that you start driving your own car a few times in Klump.
Clearly - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly avoids the joy of the game.
And that's a pity, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and occasionally also so busy that you almost don't know where one of the heads stands.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "debt" is about it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something else...
An unusual idea is also the car change over the course of the race.
You must not overlook the gas stations on the track, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car is sufficient that you have just done.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the Serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history is also the task mode (requirements) - so the races in the individual localities that you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also experiences for your own profile, which is shared for tasks (requirements) and history.
To reach the higher level of drivers, several items need to be opened: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is simultaneously connected with the online Autolog function, which compares among other things its own results with those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible carvers is a situation in the final race of history.
Here you get by car into a subway tunnel (meineways) where you cycle long on the rails in the dark (meineways).
On the tacho, numbers range from 150 to 200 km/h (meanway), but there comes a subway at one time from the back and runs an uncompromised to Schrott.
In our editors we will probably have a long time to argue about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases quite appealing and even brilliant here and there.
All the more annoying is that, at some exciting moments, the frequency of the images slows down, and sometimes this is quite dramatic.
However, this concerns, in particular, accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not benefit anything anyway.
The sound reproduction is O.K. and the soundtrack is taste matter.
In an effort to address a scale as broad as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lá was created "from everyone" - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game was not reduced by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned, we could have claimed with the breasttone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game looks somehow incomplete.
In itself a great pleasure, but one should be prepared to see this mistake with the power of airport lights.
Concert of the "Susmous Revolution Students" with singing ensembles of the Karls University
The Festival Festa Academica now offers for the third time the refreshment of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Samten Revolution and this with its music experience.
In the course of the festival, the twenty professors and colleges present themselves.
The focus of the festival is on the two concerts held on 17 November.
"The Karls University has a large share in the festival."
"The choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanist Studies is also represented among the participants, and the rector Václav Hampl is also in the festival committee," said Jakub Čaloun, director of the organization team.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of professional school choirs, which will take place on 17 November from 14:00 at the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program includes the composition of the important Czech jazz artist Karel Růžička "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evening hours, the concert "Students of the Total Revolution" (Studenty meetingtu) will be held in the halls of the People's House in Vinohrady, where university choirs also occur, do not exclude choirs of the Karls University.
Festa Academica sets itself the goal not only to celebrate the World Student Day and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Samten Revolution, but to present choral music to the public at the highest level and to promote the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organizer is the association of Czech choirs in cooperation with the Johannes-Kepler-Gymnasium.
Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of the capital Prague and Václav Hampl, took over the entire event.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and in Pardubice.
The schedule also includes numerous music meetings, student hoppings, matinees and other events.
Detailed information can be found on the website of the festival www.festacademica.cz
EU Ambassador Vicenova:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has made the balance between the individual institutions felt out of the lot."
I didn't expect such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five, six years until the waves are smoothed and everyone will have got used to their new role," said Milena Vicenova, Czech Ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
How seriously she takes the motto "Intellectually and openly about Europe", she already showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she succeeded in describing the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she would have been able to envy some of the doctrines of the Faculty of Law of Charles University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At the beginning, criticism was made that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who had not grown such a role, but I must say that it was all breathing up how well he had taken the matter.
"He is a human being who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, communicate with them and who, above all, has clear ideas about how to continue with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, she then said in response to the question: Who is this -- the European Union? What number should I call?", i.e., as an important step towards the agreement and better legibility of EU policies towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us our oil hats Quargel
Ms Vicenova also devoted herself to the agenda for the European Union to live and to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago described it as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the Presidency described it as a major negative, which had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has all its hands to do.
In the words of the ambassador, it was not only the Presidency but also the subsequent crisis which has not yet been overcome, that was quite hectic.
And the EU's seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slender and economical budget, which gives priority to sectors, which countries are more and less encouraged - all this is on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Comprehensible about Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it's grievances, foreign words and specialist jargon that nobody understands.
How can I, as a citizen, actually know whether in Brussels you really want to cremate or to think round cucumbers and various large bananas or whether someone really wants to forbid us?
It would have liked to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are in a position to be Euroskeptics who perceive the negatives more than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Do you believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is near, then the Frenchman says next to me: "He, what are you doing together - is this your V4 again?" and doing so makes a pretty acidic mine.
According to Vicenové, the EU expects in the future, above all, strong rules for the budgetary policies of Member States.
As much more realistic, as a "European Federation", it looks at the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the countries of the Eurozone and the countries away from the Eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
"At first it was said that only the countries that want it and those who do not want it should be quietly away."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong "Europe of different speeds", Mrs Vicenova expects.
In this respect, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle that all topics with an impact on the whole EU must be discussed by all Member States and not just by the countries of the Eurozone.
Brand Story:
The Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that characterizes IBM's strategy most accurately, then it would be the word "long-life".
For the general public IBM is the synonym of technological revolution, one knows it as a modern company, although since its founding a century has already passed.
The basis for this longevity was already the first of her bosses - visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became a trademark to mark the life of the future giant (and at the same time to the title of the company's internal magazine, which was already published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the corporate culture prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a high-quality movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was therefore successful for a whole century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not frighten back from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society over the course of our first century.
We hope that we will create even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the director of the company today on the occasion of the anniversary.
Well thought-out system
Watson was already in charge of social care for his employees in the 1930s, similar to that of the trader Ba, who worked in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had a vacation paid as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the businessman plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a well thought-out reward system for the best newcomers and dealers.
The long-term relationships between IBM and its customers are just as sophisticated.
From the beginning, the company was brilliant in talent promotion – as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM raised any discrimination – and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan, which Palmisan will be replaced by a woman at the head of IBM next year - is also by Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, and has until now taken the position of the head of the Vetriebs, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has made so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - Ideas are enough, the company employs almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Its unshakable position in business guarantees the company a strong image, both inside and outside.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist, Professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," added George Colony from Consulting-Company Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference only to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - called in the states of its logo because of family "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies IBM owns most patents and already five of its employees were awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most well-known inventions include e.g. bank machines, credit cards, financial swap, bar code or even diskette.
With dollar 220 billion (market capitalisation), IBM was the second-largest technology company (equivalent to Apple) this year, with Microsoft’s first acquisition since 1996.
The Look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the attempt with its own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or even IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not be emotionally tied to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundation walls on different platforms - and if they don't work to leave them again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, who basically stands and falls with his operating system Windows.
Successful technologies
IBM's profits are mainly services, software and hardware involved in one-fifth each.
In 1990, hardware with a more than fifty percent share was still the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profits of 15 billion dollars, but at the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in purchasing future technologies.
In these investments IBM will continue after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time swept the world like a storm.
Again, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment range in the middle of the major global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM has survived the current crisis.
The value of IBM shares has increased rocket-like by 120 percent since 2008 and the company's re-profit is growing in quality.
IBM's company slogan is: everything can be changed - only the values can't be changed.
This is why this flexible giant can also be expected to cope with the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutter to all over the world
The IBM (International Business Machines) company, founded a hundred years ago in New York, initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Corporation.
The name IBM took over it only in 1924 - originally it was a trademark name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the later IBM society laid the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the famous Stech card watches to register the start and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also had the chair of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who appointed the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
This leader even put the founders of IBM in the shade - based on Watson's ideas to this day the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson headed the company until 1952.
IBM, as already the name reveals, began with the manufacture and distribution of all possible machines for trade - from sausage and cheese cutters, to checkouts.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled her sales to $9 million and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he was sitting in the chair for all forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped lead NASA flights to space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture in 1964 - the series IBM System/360.
A classic PC that determined the computer standard of that time came to the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant's share of PricewaterhouseCooper and thus became fully involved in the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM pays out over the last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas that have not even been planned so far, e.g. to improve the situation in traffic and in urban administration.
In the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform to help dealers lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
IBM founded a branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe at all.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
Central for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and here is also a top research team of world-levels that deals with voting recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful spouses:
Iveta - you can keep this ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is finished!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45) had become their lover, Darina was still hoping that Joseph would wake up from his rosary dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the further life it has set itself clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová offered refuge to the singer I. Bartošová in her own house, she probably wouldn't even have been in the dream of how this happened to her husband.
When Iveta moved back and forth on her push after 30 days, Joseph went right away.
Yes, he even knew publicly that he loved them.
At the time Darina resigned, yes, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again - but now she gave him a final run.
Rychytář doesn't care who sleeps with his wife
If Rychtář Iveta should leave Bartošová in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a human being to whom I still have certain ties," said Rychtářová; but she also said that she has already separated herself emotionally from him and insists solely on mutual persuasion.
The fact that Darina locked the back door to him has so far been with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper-ehe and that's what I respect."
"The company continues, I care about the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"With Darina, I'm staying normal, only the bed we don't share," said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to look for a new love, he doesn't want to stop it.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who that is.
I realize that's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take all responsibility.
The worst female evils: What about you?
If you ask the men to call them some typical female virtues, they will shake out of their sleeves a few prompts without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let some Unsitted Revue happen again, which let the men roll the blood in the veins?
Purchasing
Do you propose to them that you be a merchant?
Do you have to buy at least one hader weekly?
Do you like to go shopping and may it be a bit more for promotions?
Then in your case it is really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping appetite half under control.
But hand on the heart, which woman does it already take to stroll through a dress shop in search of a good sitting outer garment and not try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how many times they've told her husband, you'd rather stay out...
Permanent Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too thick?"
"I have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do I even like you?"
Is that somehow common to them?
Yes?
Then you may also be among the women who are actually possessed of what they look like.
That doesn't mean you're supposed to let go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife is constantly sorry about her appearance.
The stronger gender is united - with increasing frequency of complaints, the women are increasingly intolerable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, hide the tub - at least twice a week.
Do you blame her partner for once again trampling on the clean tiles with dirty shoes, kicking the children, because the sore sink is dirty again and because the glass door at the living room cabinet has fingerprints again, where polishing makes so much effort?
If you are suffering from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you are not allowed to exaggerate anything and that the order and cleanliness in family life are not the first priority.
In the end, this unadulterated smell of purity can also damage mutual relations and, above all, family rest.
Shuffling
"Fucky gymnastics come into the wash basket."
"Do you really want to put on the old socks tomorrow?"
"A wet towel is not easy to throw on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a Tirade, don't be surprised that this brings him to the palm.
Clearly, that's not bad. They just want everything to have its order.
If the men knew this, the women might not need to micker so much.
Clasp and tratsch
Some women like to clap and kick, there are swaddling behind their backs or even slandering or forging alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to hear such topics, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, every one of us women has a little harmless clasp and sluggish in stock.
Hand in the heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with clumsy coarse calibers, to whom nothing and no one is holy, who are likely to despise everyone in their surroundings and which represent a major danger especially to women’s collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
In the Mondays game of the NHL, Jaromír Jágr, ice hockey tower Jaromír Jágr, with two assistants, had a large share in Philadelphia's 5-3 victory on the Carolina ice and is by this again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who was also an assistant and the best player in the match, was the recipient of the review of the thirty-nine-nine-year-old ice hockey star.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's player Jakub Voráček.
Jágr claimed that after the game journalists he had prophesied Giroux a great evening.
"I tell him before the game that today a Hattrick succeeds him."
I kind of felt that."
"He and again such a feeling comes to pass," said Jágr, after his action Giroux already scored a goal at the first shot of the flyers.
A little later the second match also had "a Czech trail".
Voráček fought the puck behind the Hurricanes gate and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the finish of the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hand, but the second third then belonged to the flyers again.
Concrete Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third hit, then Wayne Simmonds led his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but certainly he's one of the best three," Jágr honoured his center.
"I wouldn't have noticed in my life that at the end of my career I was playing with such an ice hockey player as he did."
"I'm so glad."
"I'm cutting my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL my players set up their game on me and now the spear turns around," Jágr smiled.
Carolina made game to the drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who went through a sentence, came to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful against one in excess of two.
"Excellently, Pronger was still active in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took up a ride, and (Read) moved to a more distant post."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráček described the last match of the game from his point of view.
As a result of this victory, Philadelphia was the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured in the game against Buffalo and resigned in the second third because of an injury to the upper body.
In addition to her, the Candiens also experienced her leadership in the Penalty shooting 2:3.
One of the fines could not change Tomáš Pleganec.
More than the lost points probably hurt the coach of the home team the high disease-related downfall in the defensive - the game played them only with five defenders to the end.
"That's bad."
"We only finished the encounter with a single experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing we can do, so we have to finish," said Jacques Martin.
"Every time we change one wave of attack after another and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec rejected thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5-2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended with a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a share.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, the ČSSR had only five approved state travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies sold mainly travels to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries at the time, and in the West only elected ones were allowed.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic (in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the peninsula of Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when they were allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore the journeys to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed citizens of the East Block (also Czechoslovakia) to travel freely within the context of socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travels were not possible.
Back then, travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but then they had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, the thing hasn't been done for a long time.
The so-called currency allocation - the condition for leaving the West - was granted only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to raise the necessary funding (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of the Czechs therefore spent their vacation in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that continues to this day.
The total revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, which is no longer known today, is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular holiday country in the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 at all because it was part of Yugoslavia at that time.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, foreign exchange obligation was lifted in the neighbouring Western European countries, which brought about a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
The Czech holidaymakers slept in the park while traveling to Paris in the tent, because who had already had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature of travel abroad from the Czech Republic was a trunk packed with canned, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our level of living and therefore average salaries increased, which resulted in another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began to prepare regular trips through charter flights after 1997, making travels incredibly acceptable in comparison to the past thanks to the opportunity to negotiate quantity discounts.
At the end of the 1990s, with the exception of the United States, the Czechs had foreign payments with all the highly developed countries in the world, which made traveling even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-salt" travel came in 2000, when thanks to the high demand the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was completed - to Thailand.
Since then, every year direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers fly in far sunny countries; this year twelve exotic destinations are taken directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100th Czechs travel annually in exotic countries!
Another important moment in the epoch that marked our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the US raised visa requirements for Czech tourists, which definitely led our country to join the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) for the first time and for the first time in their history spent more than 15 cents of CZK per head for a single holiday, including the cost of the holiday resort.
The general meeting is expected to find a new chairman - again a patent threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has not been a chairman, and it threatens that Ivan Hašek's successor at the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting on Thursday in Nybrok.
To date, there is no agreement on which electoral order is to be elected.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, requiring his colleagues to find themselves in some and a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old quarls between the two chambers of association broke out again, which cannot agree on a joint candidate.
This became clear on 16 September when the new chairman was to be elected.
The members of the General Assembly had come to the People's House in the Prague district of Smíchov for nothing, because the negotiations did not lead to any result and it was not just the election itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who was actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the legislative representatives or the officials equipped with authority.
In this single point, at least partial agreement was reached, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, which, in its opinion, was not a proxy-based representation.
However, the disputes surrounding the electoral system continue to persist.
The Executive Committee, too, no longer brought clarity into the matter, whose meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - are in principle nothing else on the agenda.
Although the views on the election changed a few times - the neural point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid a patt situation?
"The issue concerns whether to proceed in accordance with the Statute or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of the FAČR representing professional football in management.
According to the standard model, in the third round of the candidate who receives the larger percentage support in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to be ready to reach the compromise that wins the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage score.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no meaning at all, this mode would question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which is best known not to bend the electoral system but to choose according to valid statutes.
It is surprising that Tomáš Paclík agrees, even if it is true that the electoral electoral system is most likely to meet Pelta by all candidates.
"My wish is that most of the time the statutes will be chosen."
"This does not mean that any absurd replacements, as at the last general meeting," said Victoria Plze, the owner of the football club, who ran for the first time and in his opinions, above all, defined Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nybrok and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for football EM today would certainly contribute to calming the mind."
"If football is only riding on the euphoric wave, then it is also more willing to cooperate," says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience from all three adepts and this at both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl's back there.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is, unfortunately, bleak."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "enforce" the rules for their own purposes."
"That's why a further blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"But I hope that the common sense will ultimately prevail," Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to accept all sides no longer remains.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if football generality will be complete until the skills game.
The charter aircraft with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were supposed to fly to Podgorica in the morning was unable to start at all in Prague because of a technical disturbance, and so it was painful to look for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the executive committee to the venue of the barrage game.
At the end of the day, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to be held on Wednesday, is certainly crucial.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister for Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked the split parties within the country's largest sports association to reach agreement.
It is much at stake: state grants, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which, according to the financial problems of Sazka, is supposed to lead the new direction to Czech sport.
Paclík goes into the struggle for the position of the chairman because he does not see suitable candidates
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner Footballman, had been able to make up a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Czech Association of Football (FAČR), he would not have taken part in the fight for this top position at all.
"If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is therefore to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that in the event of his victory he is planning to perform the position of the chairman only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
"I spoke to some of the people in question personally."
"It's hard to believe that some people told me that they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to change," he said.
Most of all, Paclík is said to disturb the connection between Pelta's and the chairman of the Pilsner County Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, who is considered to be a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegates' votes on general meetings.
For Paclík, it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta should have the position of the chairman.
"In his victory, today's state would be preserved, and Czech football would not have made any progress at all."
"The support from Berbr, a clever businessman, would be twice bad for the football," said Paclík.
He also points out that Pelta's name, some time ago, was in connection with telephone stops to investigate a corruption affair, but that Pelta was born of impunity.
"I don't know which prestige a victory of Pelta should bring in the (sh.) football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who said his earlier statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman", but sees something rather late.
However, if Paclík is to win the Thursday election, he can imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the general meeting in October, is also thinking that he ended up with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to go to."
He's got great abilities.
"I could well imagine him as head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters that I don't understand," said Paclík, who had been taking care of it in September, replacing the Dagmar Damková after the referee commission with Lu,ěk Macela.
Paclík himself claims that he feels the role of the chairman of the association grew.
He is also the head of Pilsen, who, with his support in May, celebrated the first triumph in the league.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence disciplinary and vocational commissions, which extends to current situations," said Paclík, who does not make a heel out of his antipathy, for example, against the Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he looked at the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would praise political leaders for the fact that more money flows from the lottery tax into sports.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should devote himself to."
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but then they also have to say firmly and clearly where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not see Paclík as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the president of the FAČR must be "overparty".
Pelta, in turn, is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to Prague's Dukla.
"That's not ideal."
"It doesn't make much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner club to a third person in order to return after one and a half years," Paclík made clear.
Pelta promised new articles of the FAČR, which created a pat-situation in the future.
Two days before the Annual General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election, he would make it strong for the FAČR to receive new statutes which in the future exclude disputes about the electoral order from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will surely degenerate in the event of a possible success of Czech selection.
Pelta had promised before the unrealized election in September that he wanted to concentrate on the national team and the acquisition of financial resources in the event of his election.
He only decided on the last moment to take part in the election before the last Shareholders' Meeting, so the two-month break would help him defend his ideas about the direction of football and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association was led by someone, the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonecer Club, who also acted for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience in leading Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are responsible for the euphoria at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, at the Annual General Meeting in June, statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as they had all been adopted.
If they hadn't allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the main document of civil society that he used as a means of loosening the delegates.
"If I become chairman, I will take it personally and be willing to take responsibility personally if it doesn't work."
"This is a fundamental thing without which he cannot be," Pelta says.
In addition, he does not try to distance himself from his counterparts.
He had previously announced that he could present himself a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes because of his legal education and knows well that his counterpart would be his first alternate.
Tomáš Paclík had not attacked him for a long time, which, in turn, did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"But his attacks were depressing, and many people were shocked by his campaign of election."
"For this reason, too, many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who would remain true to his proclamations, which he had already uttered in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest classes, to the national team.
And this should be the sign of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians, to the post-mortems of the corruption scandal of last year."
"I would soon be rushing into negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure sufficient funding for the whole of football," said ČTK, 60-year-old candidate two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean any personal cleansing.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the working content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where there is clearly nervousness due to the long anarchy.
Despite the present catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If really should be the only contentious point of choosing in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"The football needs credibility and it only returns by having a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his functional career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR starts working hard under him
If the former vice-chairman Jindřich Rajchl was to be elected as the new Chairman of the Czech Association of Football at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would supposedly avoid the mood of many people in the Association.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in case of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas responsible.
He also promised to solve the case of Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into football, and otherwise to continue the work started by former Chairman Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I would like to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
Starting from international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, the national selection, professional football, up to performance football for youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything by myself," Rajchl said in conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore would like to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I'm going to distribute hard tasks so that the football in every segment is progressing with milestones."
Many would not be particularly delighted about this because instead of criticizing others' work, she would now have to start working really hard for herself," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it had considered not to run at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, who don't unmove me to throw buttons between the legs and question every step I'm taking," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"Many people told me that I shouldn't give up because other people would do it."
"That's trust you can't play," he said.
Apparently also motivated him to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years, we have managed a great deal of work, and I don't want to just throw it away."
"The process was started, probably only in a few years, and I wouldn't see anyone stop it," he said, expressing his concern that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"He is above all standing people who would make the football so that he would be there only for elected ones."
I guess you can blame me for some things, but not that I'm partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone because it's all right and not just the chosen one," said Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a president of the Czechs.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for breeding."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech part and a Moravian part, whose winners then ascend to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclík has now joined the fight for the position of the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me to its vice-president and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the saving of fifty million crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, he is partly blamed for the fact that the association does not draw on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta, "he is disqualified from the outset to help the Czech football to re-trust," he considers the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate who really has something to offer the football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek initiated and the human occupation in the Commission would obviously not change in principle."
He certainly wouldn't want to bend things in his favor," says Rajchl about his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jumping to the Blue
By Julia Stanek
Planschbasin in Ufo-Optik, Prunkpools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience its blue miracle - and rest the tired legs in spas after a city tour or hike.
A book shows where wellness is most beautiful in the water.
If Iris Meder went on a research trip for one and a half years in the past, one in her luggage was not allowed to miss her swim suit.
Lying on the water, she looked high in artfully designed domes, she swam marble puts waiting on her on the pelvis edge, and marveled at acryphal restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, she took it up in her notebook - and she knew-worthy details about the building's design and history.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architecture historian Meder in this way - and now presents them in her recently published book "Badefrouden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "trip to the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true swim culture enthusiast.
She doesn't have much fun with sports, says Meder - only in the water is that different.
Annoyed only that swimmers have to find themselves with blue tiles and chlorine tank, while Jogger can breathe the enchanting scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful bird-stupids in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Mede living in Vienna.
"So I started to collect beautiful bathrooms."
Water surface doubled architecture
The wellness factor in baths is therefore so great because all senses are served, says Meder.
And when the builders have tried, swimming halls can be a real sighting: "Stand of a floor you have a surface of water in bathrooms."
"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, spring boards.
The small-format image book "Badefreuden" conveys on 190 pages interesting facts about the architectural and cultural history of historic wellness oasiss - but above all it is a pleasure to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by pool collector Meder in their research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, they found a nitrate-containing water in a ancient carsthal (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in mind from the Zurich roof pool, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the driving on the ski slopes.
The perhaps most extraordinary pool design awaits guests in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three to three open shells it evaporates in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not every swimming pool the pool collector Meder rose the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulfur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so strongly like fuel oil, which is hardly believed to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen-carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose swallow sticks to the skin as soon as you slip into the basin - a wellness experience of the special kind.
In one place Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing sites: When she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing pool in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a closed area.
The bathroom designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic was closed in 1902.
When Meder threw a look through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw how weeds grew between the tiles.
On the other hand, it was in an enchanting swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction are already behind this bath; you can discover not only neo-Romanic elements from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added by 1900.
Since careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite pool of the Pool-Kennerin Iris Meder - not just because it was originally from the Black Forest.
"It's already an achievement to merge different architectural styles into such a great unit," Meder says.
At such a palace the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only minor.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank lets raw material business shine
By Christian Teevs
Is the Deutsche Bank putting up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January the CEO then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
The matter is clear to the Germans: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on global raw materials markets are driving the prices up - and that is why banks have a say in the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically aimed at Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw material laws were intended to secure dealers against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the soccer companies have decoupled themselves from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to examine the accusations and said that no business was "valued to put the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an International Working Group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch Report.
By the end of the year, the results will be presented to the Board of Management of Deutsche Bank - including a recommendation on how to deal with this.
At the end of January, the bank's head will then announce its consequences.
In the end, a reduction in the raw material business could stand out, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann plays on his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial industry: "Betting at rising prices of food is particularly dramatic, how carelessly banks today damage the general good."
Ackermann is now particularly obliged as the highest banking lobbyist.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, using money for bets at food prices," Bode said.
"Whether it's Mr. Ackermann about hungry people or the call of the Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes at first glance surprising, but it is clear that the head of the group wants to give a perfect picture of a few months before his departure from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Chief Executive Officer would not change to the Supervisory Board unless planned.
With a rejection of the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to break down, he doesn't have to shave himself - that would ultimately have to do his successor.
Each second would terminate raw material installations
Foodwatch tries to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute forsa interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Just eleven percent believe it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities in which food prices are paid.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: According to each second, the survey would terminate all the facilities in which money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would dissociate acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent reported thinking about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with altitudes, depths and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 awarded prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and came.
Now he will be reopened as an exhibition house.
The Austrian Pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Bressler World Exhibition 1958 is a striking and famous example when the modern post-war architecture is warmed by clear shapes, glass halls, courageous swimming and new construction materials typical of the belief in technical progress.
Schwanzers Pavilion then got the Grand Prix d'Architecture for his light and floating steel glass construction.
The construction is still regarded as a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made it so known to the architects that he also built at the next exhibition of Austria's Pavilion.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus placid side building in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
After the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof, the Pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been set up, rebuilt and opened in 1962 a 20th century museum - the "20s house" was called it.
However, the building was neither spatial nor technical as a museum - no walls to hang art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, he is now called "21er Haus" and is used as a museum of contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening the museum Belvedere, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a happiness in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of the Austrian Gallery of Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art historians with considerable careers, among other things, in youth as an ice art runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, strongly implemented the conversion with politicians and monument protectors, she acquired public funds and private sponsors and established the use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookstore should exist, and an office building had to be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krischanitz was the ideal occupation for the performance.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna was carefully converted and expanded and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilion for him was a "untimely important place" where he had seen the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which was already lost in generosity and ease when he moved to Vienna and its re-use.
In today's reconstruction, there were far more problems: the building was "an energy sling," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fiber-reinforced insulating glass used and the roof of glass replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two basements brought room for the new use, a lowered light grave between house and street ensures exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red brown rust protection colour.
And the cinema room is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all of this under strict supervision of the memorial authority and with a small budget.
"Of course, a material that is good and cheap has to be found and also liked the Monumental Office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all constraints, problems and reconstructions, the building has remained flexible and easy.
It was difficult with the Pavilion, "who came from Brussels", Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-City story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants "to raise a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because it is a city-building happiness: the completely newly planned "Main Stationsquartier" is being created around the Swiss garden, with office and residential houses.
And another luck may occur: the 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and as one hears it already negotiates with the city for a neighborly location in the Swiss Garden.
Train plans winter crisis package in millions height
The railway has designed a crisis plan to prevent train losses in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
That costs millions.
According to a newspaper report this year, Deutsche Bahn also issues more than 70 million euros in the fight against winter-related train failures and delays.
The "Image" news reported in advance, calling for an internal corporate crisis plan, with investments of around 300 million euros planned by 2015.
This will improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees for snow treatment on rail and rail stations to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free rails until the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary routes within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, train chief Rüdiger Grube warned against train failures and delays in this winter after a summit with government and industry.
Last winter the railways had considerable problems in passenger transport, as they lacked reserves in difficult weather conditions, among other things.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railways Office for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train also has been making it possible for years that it has to have axles of ICE trains tested significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE had an axle break at the Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the USA
After the tumult, head Josef Ackermann comes new trouble from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million dollars there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giants are now also bringing their past to the US: the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to resolve disputes due to the Pleite of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The NCUA financial market regulator proposes a number of large banks to have seduced cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; they would have played down the risks.
Such papers lost a strong value during the financial crisis and broke the banks into depth.
"We are satisfied that we could solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The bank was not to blame for the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to paying $20.5 million.
NCUA chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the presence of the two houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and jumps into Pleiten to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA tries to get the resulting billions of damages replaced.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also made use of other large banks and in the summer of JPMorgan Chase, who sued Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The mortgage papers in question are so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are the basis of domestic loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble set in 2007, this became a burden on a large number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers turned.
Even if the events have been over for several years, the banks are currently blowing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and supervisory authorities have made countless complaints in order to obtain reparation or to avoid mistakes.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest appeal wave.
It has proposed 18 major international banks to have overrun two U.S. real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage businesses in the volume of some 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also has to file a complaint from FHFA, which concerns several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurters to be right for "substantial losses", but without mentioning an exact sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unstoppable and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion at IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March he has bought more than ten billion dollars worth of shares.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always explained that he did not invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies was only a bad thing.
However, he has now read IBM's Annual Reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had to understand a lot earlier that IBM mainly provided services and provided computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is regarded as a knight's blow in the financial world.
As a result, the IT-Urgestein IBM may now call itself "Sir IBM".
For Buffett has now revealed in the US economic station CNBC that he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known something about the engagement so far.
He praised the management, which even in the economic crisis had made good profits.
"They did a great job," said Buffett on the strategy.
IBM has been relying on the lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for some time now.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful company calculators.
Buffett had avoided technology companies until then.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett used Buffett, for example, for a freight railway, for a lubricant manufacturer or machine manufacturer.
In addition to around 80 own subsidiaries, Berkshire Hathaway also owns shares in a number of major companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich back.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and, with clever investments, expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unsavory sense of earning money brought him the nickname "Orakel von Omaha".
After the Buffett investment, the IBM share increased by one percent in advance.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock market and is thus one of the most valuable technology companies in the world together with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, said Buffett, but he doesn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zell" Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now alive again.
The murders of eight Turkish and a Greek small businessman from 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extreme background.
This message will respond with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-doors, this means that a long-awaited ghost returns: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with right-wing extremist background against Turks.
Still, the fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the exposed right-wing extremist network reveals a scale whose dimension is far from visible.
"Does the bloody ideology live up again?" was the title of the Internet issue of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" emphasizes that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the right-hand radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded: it reminded the victims of racist violence on the weekend with a warning guard in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had planned a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish application agreement.
In cheerful colors, the co-examination had been staged - as a story of success.
The title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series, is "Germany's gift for the fiftieth".
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot take it to draw this mental connection.
"It starts to smell, is called the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered who had paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the action of the police and their subsequent success is discussed critically.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not think much of looking for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some of them are at least rhetorically prepared to use drastic means: "If there is still a slut here, there is nothing left to the migrants but self-defense and the weaponry".
"That will be the best self-protection."
"From the goodness of the Enlightenment and the adequacy of the punishment of the whole network, the inner peace in Germany is very much dependent on," writes "Selen".
What it means when the inner peace is in danger in Germany, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties explain.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply embedded in German and Turkish memory.
No other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can result in right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the feeling of ours on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics was particularly adjourned after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After Solingen's fire attack, he sent a condolence to the Turkish President, but at the funeral ceremony in Cologne he was represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at that time picked up in his speech how many charges were made by these Turks.
It is as if the value of a person according to the amount of his tax.
The current reporting of Turkish media shows once again how deeply the mistrust of many German towers has been in the local rule of law since then.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive information and re-evaluation of the extreme right of terrorism in Germany, it needs to be opened this time.
The Scandal Bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
In the financial crisis, the UBS has almost failed and has since gone from a crisis to the next.
Now it's supposed to be a German.
Well, that's probably not how Axel Weber was thinking.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank in July, it was announced that he would enter an almost as spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was happy publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for their newly gained solidarity and dropped friendly remarks about future colleagues.
"UBS made the turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grubel."
But already in September it became clear that everything would come completely different.
A dealer of UBS in London had bypassed all the bank's security systems and soaked around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Chief Executive Officer Oswald Grübel, a banker famous not only in Switzerland, had to go.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS has since been regarded as beaten - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has already been announced that Weber may advise the Bank on February 2012.
And he already takes over the Board of Directors in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, that's gonna be hard.
He is not a banker, but a professor of economics and music bankers, and would certainly have needed a working time.
With one blow, he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that she has long earned the title "Europe's largest scandal bank".
On the one hand, the UBS is huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and has been slipping from a scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, remains the once so proud Swiss bank.
It began in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
She had combined the image of the silent and solid, but also well-buffed Swiss asset managers with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, as an investment bank, she was promoted to the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later longtime bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger says: "My students I always put the UBS as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, they ask themselves, "How could I be so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007 it was first revealed that something was properly wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Officer Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, which until then was considered to be a highly intellectual and also brilliant banker.
A few months later, he knew why he had gone.
The bank's investment savings had been soaked with subprime monkeys and had to write billions off.
In order to train this, the UBS announced a capital increase of say and write 13 billion francs.
For this, she actually found investors, but which, some until recently, would have rubbed the nose: an intransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so silent that one didn't even know his name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The Bank had to announce new billion losses, President Marcel Ospiel, the Swiss Board of Directors, which was paid the second-best in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS stood before the collapse in the financial crisis in view of its failure to invest and had to be saved from the state.
The National Bank purchased UBS for ten billion problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion Swiss francs for a forced change bond over which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses so large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of the UBS 2007 was more than five times that of Switzerland's economic performance (see graph).
"Once again, we could not save UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The second one joined the first catastrophe.
A few months later, UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data from wealthy customers who may have withdrawn taxes with the aid of the Bank.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a refund of unjustified profits from these shops, including fines.
So the UBS knew more or less openly to have helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the nimbus of confidentiality.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the Exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: investment banking through the mis-speculation and asset management through the help of tax evasion.
And just when it got a bit quieter again, just as you thought, now the UBS will get it back, then this insidious trader story follows: A single dealer has socked EUR 1.7 billion before the bank realizes that something goes wrong.
And it becomes apparent: With the risk management in investment banking, it still does not work.
"With the case of Adoboli, it has to be noted that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, Economics and Financial Professor at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also confident: "The problem of UBS is that it does not control the risk control."
It was the very idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago started to become guardians of the great wealth of the world: no too great risks, security for money - could even collapse the world beyond the Republic of the Alps.
The safes of the Swiss banks have become a symbol of unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still fits to the cliché of the rich Swiss private bank - it is only a bit larger.
Already the situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads from the main train station directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the warehouse rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elitist private banks such as Julius Bear.
The reception hall of the UBS is accessed by a heavy turning door.
Inside the walls are marble-dressed, before that are thick leather chairs, next to the bank logo a large sign for the "Safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point it is repressed - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, and finally, like all Swiss bankers, he also makes business with the two large banks.
UBS had grown much too big, he found - especially in investment banking, where the fishing axes had spread.
The Swiss had nothing to say there.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the fishing axes."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, gave it high profits first and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss large bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became apparent.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Händ in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion Swiss francs or about 45 billion euros, politicians approved to save the big bank in front of the bank.
How could that happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, you will see the problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks joined together into a huge group.
A bank was formed, which was already too large for small Switzerland - and grew ever further.
In doing so, the two different predecessor banks of the UBS added: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers arrived at a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007 and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Opel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Opel, the belly man who has worked up from banking to the very top."
But Opel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," said Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: Oversight came before the case.
UBS employees remember clearly the executive meetings on which Group Chief Wuffli repeatedly issued the same parallel: Goldman Sachs hit the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go up there.
You've been successful a few steps.
In the foreign exchange business and in the stock trade, she played at the top.
However, business consultants who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there was a huge distance to the largest banks.
UBS have gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that cost her almost the existence.
Hungry after growth, both the bank and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime facilities.
It developed into a huge machine that packed and expanded securities on American mortgage credit – but also contained risks.
Also, when other banks had long been looking for the exit.
"Even in summer 2007, when the American real estate market stood in flames, the UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
A manager after the other had to go when the attempts were more difficult than intended.
Posts at the UBS became a smuggler seat and are still wobbly to this day.
Those who run the grand bank now have an almost impossible job.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has passed all the nearby business models.
Bank researchers Geiger already have an idea: closing with investment banking, focusing on asset management, returning to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment banking is supposed to shrink strongly, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to introduce his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo Swiss was actually only thought to be a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessors Grübel.
He has now been persuasive: He is to run the business of the UBS permanently, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to the booth in the mid-1990s.
3500 points he's cutting.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has already asked himself.
He has only publicly said that he and his wife will first seek an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdened US banks
The threatening recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without force.
The threatened industrial production on the continent stifled the hopes for a stabilisation of the debt crisis in the germ.
The general facilitation of government change in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems were again highlighted, said Mark Luzini by Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones index of the standard values was recorded at the trade close by 0.6 percent at 12,078 points with a minus.
In the course of trade, the market barometer split between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The broad S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The Nasdaq technology market index lost 0.8 percent and went out of trade with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax passed with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5985 counters.
Industry in the 17 euro-zone countries has significantly reduced its production and turned to the end of the upturn.
The companies produced two per cent less in September than in the previous month, as reported by Eurostat.
The US investors were skeptical: "We are not an island but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to free itself from recession as quickly as possible, nor will there be further signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
It is therefore too early from his point of view to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-old principle over the pile and entered the US technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM was based on the share price of the traditional group and had him recorded close to one percent higher against the trend in trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at 187.35 dollars.
Buffett paid an average of 170 dollars per piece according to his own details and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
The Bank of America's shares were significantly higher at 2.6 percent than the market.
The house silvers almost all the rest of its shares in the China Construction Bank and covers $6.6 billion for that.
With the net profit from the business, the Institute intends to boost its capital ratio and therefore comply with more stringent regulatory requirements.
The aircraft builder Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The stock won 1.5 percent after the company had collected the largest order of its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-distance machines of type 777 on Sunday and ordered the value of the order to 18 billion dollars.
Including 20 other machines, the volume is even 26 billion dollars.
At the New York Stock Exchange, around 710 million shares changed ownership.
719 values increased, 2281 declined, and 79 remained unchanged.
In the case of sales of 1,38 billion shares, the Nasdaq closed 630 in the plus, 1913 in the minus and 82 unchanged.
Intelligent cranes are expanding in cities
In many places, seeds are considered as "problem birds": but from the cities the highly intelligent animals are no longer able to drive out, experts claim.
They like them, the others want to get rid of them very quickly: cranes have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities there are inhabitants who have problems with the dirt and noise of the animals.
So far, a means against the "problem birds" is not in sight.
Seed cranes are no longer out of the cities, experts said at the first Crane symposium in the East Frisian void.
There, experts from all over the federal territory reported on possible exits.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
In doing so, conservationists have also reduced the problems in cities to the landflight of the particularly protected seeds: chemical use in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing cultivation and the fall of typical brood trees made life difficult for birds.
Cranes are protected by nature.
There are major colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in the Westfälse Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, as well as in Leer.
In 2005, there had been a controversial project on the massive killing of cranes in the district of Negative Slips.
Critics had referred to the catch of animals in bird traps and the slaughter with buds as particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the surprise, brings nothing," said the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer.
Injecting nests with water or falling trees often have unwanted consequences, also said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals differ, large colonies split up and spread in other places."
Assemblement can only be considered as an exception to hospitals, old people's homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we won't get them away."
Without the surrounding country, the problem in the cities could not be solved, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner said from Leer.
A combination of the animals from sensitive living areas and locks is thought to be possible to relocate them in other places.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different way of dealing with the animals: "We can finally bear a pickle in the face best self-confidence."
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad in Schleswig-Holstein, where he told us about the life of the highly intelligent seeds.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seeds not only use tools to get to a delicacy, but even produce their own tools as a tool.
Conductors at the University of Cambridge recently tested four seeds, as far as the intelligence of birds is sufficient.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they have to bring a scaffolding scaffolding to a motten larve.
Without much training, they recognized the size and shape of a stone to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the pointed cranes then had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had placed wires on them.
From it all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then nailed the bucket on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seeds even managed to do so at first.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup remained out.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are included at the EM 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the Play-offs.
Leaded by the double successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.) Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM participation in the match perfectly after 0:0.
The Czechs had a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off game at outside Montenegro, after the play (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
Nothing more made Croatia burn at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland took a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) achieved the following results for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trader (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had twice shortened for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the Play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal got a start by measure.
Ronaldo chased a release of about 30 meters for early lead in the stitches.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his wide shot qualities and met from 25 meters to 2–0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance through Torjäger Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City put a headball on the lower edge of the latte, but the ball did not cross the gate line (33.).
Jiracek meets for the Czech Republic
After that, arbitrator Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was at the heart.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penitentiary, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trader after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who safely transformed Misimovic.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-European champion made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time in a row that the European champion will drive to the EM in 1976.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga-Legionaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) also had luck and had to pass a horrendous second in the early stages.
Endingman Petr Cech prevented a potential owner from Tomas Sivok with a reflex at the last moment (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot just past the gate of Cech in the 40th minute from the rotation of the penalty area limit.
After the break, the cross-section had to save for the already beaten world-classendorwart of the Czechs, again the striker of the FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football wound.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not come beyond 0:0.
While National Trainer Guus Hidddink has to clear his place on the 2002 World Cup-Third Bank, the Croats can enjoy their fourth participation in an EM round.
Before 31,000 spectators in Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
In the seventh minute, Selcuk Inan met only the paws, attacker Kazim Kazim was unable to lower the impacter in the gate.
However, after the horrendous seconds, Croatia took control more and more.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who was in place for Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga-Legionaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayer Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni drives to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first EM participation in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of Trainer Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4:0 success in the game, in the 32nd minute lead.
Konstantin Vassilev (57.) equal for guests.
Ireland pushed to speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only in the last moment did the Estonian hintermanship prevent the possible leader.
But in the 32nd minute it was ready.
After an unfortunate defense of Enderman Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pressed the ball to the 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China in the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros), the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We're going to create additional research and development institutions and set up employees accordingly," announced Co-Chair Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is now expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader in corporate software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the world's more than 176,000 SAP customers are sitting in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the 2015 Dax Group strategy.
SAP wants to increase sales by 2015 to EUR 20 billion.

"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our aim is to promote sustainable growth in China through comprehensive information."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
The new book "Beautifulness and terrors begin in the heart of Peter Englund. A story of the First World War, tells in nineteen fates" with a long list of the main people who go to heart.
Here's a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in Englund’s romantic narrative very well. And these main people will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments where you like Englund’s men and women are lost in the fog of war and robbed of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote an unusual book, which he does not misrepresent as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few great names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, fasting reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beautifulness and horror" is almost the war experience of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulances and office staff.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, become crazy or die.
Each of these lives flickers up like the votive candles in a church, some are added, while others disappear.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that World War I was only the devastating war on the West Front.
"Beautifulness and terror" with expert views of other war locations: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on bee baskets, one celebrating Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe, like a Hurricane Katrina, who smells of cordit.
Imagine, you're a woman who's at home with her children and listening to gunfire in the distance. Stay or take the escape?
Who's coming anyway?
No one understands what is happening or why this war is even being waged.
"Feeding facts," Englund notes, "were furnished with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beautifulness and terror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life reports can be terrifying or poignant, but they are extremely lively in clounds of the collection of small moments lost in detail.
Many of them act from want and help.
In the history of a German schoolgirl, he says: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, false eraser gum, paper associations, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacement dinner in Germany.
He describes "Fleisch made of pressed rice and baked in hammelfat (and most recently served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato bowls, shoes that were made with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes that were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories act on honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to wildness and says about the war: "You feel that this is despite all that was intended for men rather than to sit in the chair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and so do, as if such a facade civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind your own strengthened and defamed shirt breast."
On the other hand, a British soldier recognizes that he is probably dying and that no one is taking note of it or will take care of it.
"If you distance yourself from the thought of sacrifice, you want to think that this is happening to an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man hanged in secret."
Other observations are from the old Europe that is falling apart and about new kinds of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiarium of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murders in the scale, who slaughters while he is sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseen way and there is as much frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund addresses the soldiers who actively tried to infect themselves with a prostitute with a sex disease in order to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in trade with Gonoccok eggs, because soldiers bought and smuggled on their genitals, hoping to come to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rip him in the eyes, which led to them being blind to the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry is supple and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he begins the way the war "in a unique way uncontrollable forces uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are putting them to war.
The best books about the First World War were usually falsified like Paul Feetell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West Nothing New" as extensive historical books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional fame hall.
His book has the most devastating end of which I have ever read in a book of knowledge.
I'm not giving it back.
But it is as if he had taken us with his book this side with the main people in front of the nose and lit with a match.
After an early error, a mini-planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing deployment helmets.
One had opted for the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at this time few people are in the Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. All others initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past few weeks such as the use of pepper spray against Protestants, which violates the rules of the dissertation and gave the householders an enormous increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat themselves.
And so, after two weeks of planning and training, the police action was carried out to remove Protestants from the Zucotti Park.
Officials had prepared them by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise took place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials strengthened the so-called chaos training - anti-terrorism measures, including the rapid relocation of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "in the last minute," someone who is familiar with the commands, which for a declaration spoke as "exercise".
"The few police who were involved in my knowledge did not know that it was about the Zucotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was Zucotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the resort."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14th, officials wanted to clear the park, but then swipe back when hundreds of protesters came together after having experienced these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including commissions from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are normally used in high criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people enter the park and go out, almost like Pendler, so that 1 o'clock at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people in the park are in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and speakers were ready before the departure on Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the previously recorded news, who were droning from the speakers, seemed to intimidate many Protestants.
When the public officials got into the park in their bright blue wind jackets, many Protestants just gathered their stuff and left the place.
The police said that until 1:45 a.m. no tents would be attacked to give the protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests be necessary in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesperson of the police president, said that this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the treatment of the officials was very rough.
Mr. Browne said that television cars on Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved towards the west through the great confusion of personal things of the Protestants, including suitcases, artificial lawns and bags with clothes, they followed employees of the urban cleaning who had been left behind.
Some Protestants who refused to go were dragged outside. Images of this appeared a short time later on the Internet.
A main core of Protestants moved near the kitchen area of the camp camp in the center of the park position.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodological arrests.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp are connected to their arms.
And two people chained themselves on trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them loose.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 pm.
According to the police, the room was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests came, as he said, because of "unresponsive behavior and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent local official was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department of criminal officials, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "didn't lead the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials on the eastern side of Broadway waited between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barrikades were built in Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south.
It could be observed how from these sites the police continued to expand the circle around the Zuccotti Park.
One place was observed, as several officials, many of them with shields, drove people outside.
About 28 persons were located in the north.
Some of the most violent activities of the night took place in the south of the park.
About 5 o'clock south of Pine Street, a Protestant jumped onto the roof of a police car and other demonstrators left the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an officer and a Protestant came to the hospital.
Trade union of supervisors will file a complaint against the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The action is probably the last opportunity that the union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reverse the redundancies.
Six hundred and seventy school assistants, care coordinators and other staff who were among the worst paid employees in the city and who had lost their jobs in a chess train on 7 October, described the union leader as political revenge for refusing access to a health fund held by the working groups last year, with which the household gap should be closed.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the redundancies were part of the budget that had been adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that there was nothing to specify in the budget that employees would be released from school.
Officials of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference on which the submission of the action before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City will act as defendants and will count eight dismissed workers as prosecutors who are all coloured or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of the City, said that the city did not submit the complaint and thus could not be commented upon.
According to a proposal submitted by the New York Times, the union has concentrated on the number of redundancies in schools in the poor districts of the city to support a complaint for inequality treatment. It claims that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfinanced.
It states that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and only few redundancies in the schools of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers were released in Districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the appeal states: "This is not a neighborhood of deceived parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th district budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, funds were lost when the city changed its method of calculating extra funding for each school registration.
The union also complains that the heads of the High Schools were led by the language into error in a memo that approved the release of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" (German: transfer) in the United States usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Six-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred," says the action proposal.
Mission ended, Congress ready to agree on Libya
At the end of the day, Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already in a position to agree on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was necessary for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's Committee for International Relations decides on a resolution which is under the authority of John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "Mut".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House disputed the choice of a number of resolutions to approve or disapprove the role of the US military in NATO's Libya mission.
In June Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that approved the limited use of military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin group of both parties and there was no vote.
On the same day, however, this law went through in the Senate. Furthermore, the board passed a decision to reduce the funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission became a kind of legislative purgatory - with a congress that was enough to criticize Obama's approach within the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull him out of the ground under his feet.
Then the congress's indecisiveness was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell among the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31st.
Now perhaps the Senate is ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "gratulates on the people of Libya for their enormous courage and their extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation" and "praising the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures be given full support by the Board for Foreign Relations or will they split the legislators as the Law of June has done?
The latest version is the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top republican of the Committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Kapitol, it is on the Senate this week to vote for a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every parliamentary period of the Republicans and some democrats.
The measures under the direction of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or other area that is currently coming to the vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far unsuccessfully tried to bring their changes to vote, even though they have often tried enough.
Goodlatte's change is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been presented to this Congress and include an entire range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented to both Congress and Senate - others are slightly different.
In the Senate alone, there are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change and another dozen that would "control bank spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners of Republicans who want to polish their resume - the possibility of boasting that they have "written" such a measure.
The budgetary control law, adopted in August, requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the balance of budgets.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of the Congress can present, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to abolish the limit to two times of office of the President.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments which, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage under the same sex is a recurring presentation, as is a change that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As zealous as Members propose amendments, they move as fast as they have in recent years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators made 77 such changes. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last change to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Effected, but not defeated", says Giffords in the first television interview after the attack.
Ten months after an armed man shot at her next distance during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday evening. She sang alone for the Broadway piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the one to return to the congress.
When she appeared in the ABC News "20/20" together with Diane Sawyer, she ran for words and needed help walking.
The mission showed the heavy slow recovery of the damage that the bullet, which divided her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from the front to the back.
She returned surprisingly to Congress three months ago to give up triumphant voice to the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, where six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang, and described her recovery as "serious."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford answered (41): "All right."
The interview with Giford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special, recorded shortly before the new book of the couple was published: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The special has been following Gifford's recovery since the attack on January 8th.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with cold shaved head and a long scarf above the forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nickel with the head.
A twitch with the lips.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played in ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: One sees how the congress members sing together with the therapists on Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours every day with therapy, said that she cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12th, he had read an article by a daily newspaper about the attack when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the attack.
The suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is necessarily treated medically while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," Gifford's Sawyer said.
"Heart, heart, heart."
During the recovery of his wife, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I would say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated?" said Kelly.
You just got hit.
And you'll get through this and you'll recover and you'll come back stronger than ever.
Forces rather feel compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and navals gathered around him on a tag.
The amount in black tuxedo rose and congratulated.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring donation campaign.
A high-ranking military officer on the Gala, observed among others by the Chief of Staff and then president, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know.
But it was no respect, really not. It was pity.
The fragile impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly distanced, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are being overcrowded with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say employees.
The public increasingly behaves as if it did the people in uniform suffering.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who was commanding troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The subject is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that returned troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, talks about compassion in silence and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, the Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of reverence, as they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if an "evil, violent veteran under the surface" is hiding, said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and after his return took over a high-level state post in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the questioners subtly asked whether he was able to stand by the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"If you are talking about your service, you must resist the negative impressions," Cancian explained to his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of American interest in war.
Services on the battlefield are rarely taken out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely usual in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a member of staff.
Forces find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the severity of their injuries.
Military is putting increasing pressure on the hard way to go through rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be sued for non-intervention in a rape in the military court.
If this is not the case, hundreds of complainants will be available for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and was pregnant during the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met with a male colleague who carried a 12 pack of beer.
He asked her if he should accompany her on a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texaner was fighting their concerns aside.
I thought, "Oh what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had heard of my stomach feeling."
Just a few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stood behind her, pressed her down and raped her, claims she.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officers are anxiously waiting for a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether an action they have brought against former Minister of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admitted to court.
The action claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not object to the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, D.C., filed the action at the beginning of 17 applicants, who, however, rose to 28, in the following months: 25 women and three men who all claim that they were raped or sexually abused by soldiers' colleagues, and that the military failed to investigate, condemn or make available an appropriate case law after the alleged attacks.
Burke says they're pursuing the highest military leadership because the problem starts there.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to exterminate the culture retribution of it? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of all the applicants putting their eggs into a basket, if necessary, they will file many further complaints in order to maintain the pressure.
The defense team, led by state attorney Neil MacBride, has submitted a request to reject the appeal.
The documents of the Court of Justice, which are available in Newsweek, are in detail based on the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged with current or former soldiers for injuries to which it has come in the armed forces.
Under a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for violations of soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage arose during the military service of the defendants," says the document.
The Ministry of Defense refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, the distinction is only on behalf of them: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, soldiers' teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war areas.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them died in fighting.
It's time the military was modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more complaints besides her are pending.
At the Yale Law School, Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a complaint against the four main military academies for alleged promotion of a female anti-female atmosphere.
Independent of this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is presenting a complaint against the military in which one concentrates on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" who received rape victims to release them from service - a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed an appeal against the Veterans Administration (i.e. the administration of the war veterans) in which she submitted her discriminatory practices in dealing with benefits for persons who claimed sexual abuse in service.
Nine laws were presented to the Congress, independently of each other by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, providing a number of clues.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (i.e. office for prevention and reporting of sexual abuse) of the Ministry of Defense 3.158, sexual abuses were displayed.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure takes account of approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that come from each year.
The report, published in March, also investigates the law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases in the military were in court, only half as many as in civil law.
The prosecutors in Burkes Fall describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole range of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, who came from a cut to his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing she was asked about the sex she had with her friend before the attack.
Six persons spoke out as characters in the name of the suspected perpetrator, who was finally acquitted.
"I still remember the day when the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the woes would use. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it incompetent.
In January 2010, she was dismissed unreservedly so that she received no support.
Whether the action, Lyman and the other defendants have been brought forward, is purely speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticised since it was first questioned.
I'm a time-live critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military goes back a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence that a liability entails.
He adds, "The odds are against her... but it's important for her to try."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow their course, Burke, the lawyer of the defendant, will begin with her hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until it comes to reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whatever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who stood up to have committed his first public hearing in the court in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by far not alone in Cyberspace: He has spent a lot of time in front of his computer attack and has cherished with some of the millions of nationalists who support the extreme right groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
That's easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report by the UK design factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebooks Hide personal data is so encyclopaedic, says Bartlett, that researchers simply need to use the site's advertising tool to precisely determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of the right-wing extreme groups across Europe and then visited them with additions, but instead of connecting with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking for their educational status, their attitude toward violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 followers of 14 very right parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office once.
"It's a pretty new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online sponsors to the right are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the page to study everything from health issues to social trends such as in "Likes", text news and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, who add three content per day on average, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research tree that has increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title in the last five years by almost 800%.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people that you normally do not reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They first had to inform the party and they would never have granted them access," says Bartlett.
"With Facebook it all goes away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues have found that students who discussed their full noise on Facebook are significantly more likely to drink problems than students who are silent on this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal-level students, such as housing consultants, monitor the page and help a student post when it poses too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children who otherwise would not have been found."
Facebook also constantly taps the data of its own population.
The site's data team has compiled statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, election participation in the 2010 intermediate elections and a National Glücksindex (which used first and foremost information on which only Facebook has access - digital freedom masters have long known that the site should make their large data base pit accessible to others for research purposes.)
But the users of Facebook know that the page they are watching, whether they want it or not. To be able to play Srabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, one allows the site to publish their own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey they don't even know anything about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think that many users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, at a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she is concerned, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile and in contributions are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Thus, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research needs to take care of the social - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
"Call and inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood up for two apocalypse who killed 77 people this summer in Norway, described himself as a "resistor" fighter in his first appearance in front of a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court, as you have received your mandate from organizations that support Hasidologies and thereby support multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the laws, but I do not owe myself."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he "didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he denied Breivik, who gave a pre-written speech, the permission to contact his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will monitor all visits and the entire correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and victims attended the hearing.
Some came in hopes of seeing Breivik, others wanted confirmation that he was behind the castle and bars.
All took part with the aim that everything would go out of the way.
"I thought he was cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian station NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it's going a bit further after I saw the suspect and heard."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked calmly and professionally throughout the hearing. He looked at journalists and survivors when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had any complications.
Some may like that the attacks of July 22 was apparently the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically facilitate the grief and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he didn't," said a victim's relative.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 lessons of the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theatre
After Steve Job's death on October 5th, some compared him with Henry Ford, highlighting the technique as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most in the recently discovered job interview, which this week was dusted off from special screenings on important markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and himself appointed hippie, but he was also an akribical organizer, who was bustling on diagrams - a man who believed that many managers suffer from "a disease of thought," "that a really great idea makes 90 percent of work... [but] there is a huge amount of craft between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995 Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Specialists" about the beginning of the personal computer. And he sat together for more than an hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that point, he had been working hard on his new computer company, NeXT, and was looking forward to the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in specialists, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing during delivery.
Only after job death did a complete VHS copy be discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known for disgusting extensive interviews, jobs here appear surprisingly enthusiastically in the explanation of his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of mind, in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and seek accuracy.
There are also moments in which jobs' perfectionism occurs when he seems impatiently reacts to Cringly's questions and encourages him to respond more quickly to topics or side negotiations of greater importance.
Before the era recorded by Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the Lost Interview appears somehow inconceivable when jobs evaluate what other companies think is right or wrong and their own vision for the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthumous claims of career jobs. But seeing jobs here as the greedy dreamer who is on the leap to grandeur is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all of this here, he pulled it off and did it.
A faster look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to lead a company:
"During the whole years of business, I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing.
I found that out.
Jobs continues its efforts to rationalize the accounting of Apple.
Astonished how costs were recorded - usually one started with "standard costs" which were based on mere presumption and which were then adjusted with "difference" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest.
As the Pope was especially pleased:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could sneak into the telephone company and for nothing lead long-distance calls.
A lot has been written about the device, but jobs of enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from an AT&T network to another, while dragging through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a dozen times around the globe and when you grunted into the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," says choking jobs.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious strike that Wozniak and he almost withdrew when they called through Blue Box in the Vatican in the middle of the night and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were able to impersonate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic Hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself got on the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute telephone call, jobs were part-time for the summer at Hewlett-Packard.
"That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at the age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, he became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever produced".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher tube, and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, jobs talk about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built in some tablets, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later on at Apple he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember striking arguments... you shouted that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was incredibly credible.
Over large enterprises leaving behind:
Long before he relived Apple, jobs looked forward to the ways in which so many industrial giants came to the test with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"If we say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copyer or printer, well and?"
They own the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [is it such people] who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is required by the people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship.
That happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
If you could have been ten times bigger, Microsoft could have been the 1990s...
You caught the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his fineness.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Finally, it goes on to taste, it goes on to say that one tries to deal with the best stuff that people have created, and then tries to bring these things together to what one does.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in standing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn't been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinate with opponents of health laws, as court case assumes
On the day when the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically shared question of whether one will listen to a challenge to President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the firm that the case is represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met at a meeting to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was an action brought by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care, which was decided by the Congress last year, a law that became a slogan for conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2 hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to lead to the 2012 presidential struggle, which will be in full swing at the time the court ruling is announced.
The lawyer who stands before the court and will claim that the law is to break will probably be Paul Clement, once general prosecutor under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative principles of law.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business that challenged the law.
Another sponsor was Pharmaziegiant Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court had advised the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the chief of the Republicans in the Senate and an explanatory opponent of the health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been visiting events of the Federalist society for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are free from the code of conduct governing the actions of the lower federal courts.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in benefit events of law nearer and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honour or according to the programme any such guest of events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms associated with the case as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in this to alert moral and government activists.
"This amazing break with morals and the contrast to the code punishes the actions of some judges, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the USA.
"The judges won and dinned at the court during a benefit event with lawyers with floating proceedings."
Their appearance and their support for a donation action for this event undermine any right to impartiality and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would mix court matters too easily with groups that can be guided by the agenda, such as federalist society.
And Thomas's wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general prosecutor under the Obama government when the first legal contests came first in court.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the case because of bias because she was too committed to defending the law in order to be unbiased.
Kagan doesn't do this.
Boeing draws record order of 18 trillion dollars to land
Airline Emirates ordered 50 two-speed aircraft of type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than 1 trillion dollars.
It is really a rare message that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it's a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 planes is total at a record total of 18 trillion dollars.
Also unusual is the client of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 trillion dollars over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest contract for commercial aircraft on the weekend, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-stage Boeing 777 Jets.
The hammer contract came from Dubai Airline Emirates.
The airline has also announced in 2011 that Boeing announced an option to buy 20 more aircraft that will raise the entire list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, ordered the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, stock exchange expert from Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil producing countries.
So they don't just have the money to pay the planes. Instead, an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines because this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country deserves at a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cancel or move aircraft orders less than other airlines when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"They have a natural guarantee," he said.
The appointment of Emirates reaffirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep Airbus competitors SAS in check, attacking the pre-power position with the A350.
Boeing victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that one would postpone the introduction of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
One shifted the introduction to gain more confidence after customers demanded a higher payload and reach.
The Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President seems to lose election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealer Fausto Vallejo of the PRI has supported the governor's post in the race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers would have influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race around the governor's posts in the western state from the institutional party of the revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime throughout the electoral process and especially on yesterday's day is alarming, not only for Michoacan but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... you have occupied election booths, built street blockades ... and commissioned people to vote for [the PRI]."
The PRI ruled in Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes to win a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have hit only a short time ago, which had still been conducted in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolution Party PRD, the current governor, came to third place, a severe defeat for the divided and happy left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denys links to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
For a long time, Michoacan was dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence is still taking place.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have gone out of the local elections for fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how present the elections in Michoacan also appear.
The man who will probably represent the PRI in the race for the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nicho, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think that this victory will make us look boldly into the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
Asia’s Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the eurozone’s rescue in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow Asia’s economy’s growth.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must do "all things in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), who look "distressly" at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources through Asia helps to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So everyone who can help Europe out of this crisis," he said to the Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union has fallen into a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have increased dangerously and the Prime Minister has resigned both from Italy and from Greece.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe is alarming that the global economy could fall into recession and led to calls for leading emerging economies to join forces to support the euro area.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of the EU-saving fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - would offer European partners greater negotiating power in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from declining exports and the drying out of foreign capital flow.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a mission, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no incentive to help the rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at U.S. Brown University, said that it would be very difficult politically to sell the 1.2 trillion people in India help for Europe, of which more than 800 million are living out of 2 dollars or less a day.
"Sometimes they will find out that the Greeks are going to retire with 50 and spend vacations on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used in order to maintain in Greece the numerous and well-paid employees in the public service, with jobs in poor management, losses of facilities such as railways.
Mr. Nag said that the crises in the Eurozone will have "significant domino effects" throughout Asia.
The forecast of ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/ is now threatening "the risk of classification" due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant shift in capital of their dictions.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon before possible cuts in the defence system
Minister of Defense Leon Panetta called the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would not notice national security. He thus triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon's halls to the war locations in Afghanistan and the civilian flow bands.
The Pentagon is already thinking of cuts of 450 trillion dollars over the next decade, but is now afraid that further cuts will be necessary by 600 trillion dollars or more if the Congress cannot reach a conclusion in its spending.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating to the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called confiscation, would result in 23% general cuts and a stopover of many new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such an inconspicuous manner, would make most of our ship and building projects impossible - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or building - and seriously damage other modernisation efforts," Panetta wrote to the Senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves involuntarily from a large part of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with the certainty of bounding probability in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness."
The cuts eventually hit the combat troops," Panetta said.
"While the war-time quotas in the anti-terrorism struggle are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the Grundbudget would adversely affect the efforts of war," warned Panetta.
"Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in the attitudes and attitudeal supervision that support the war."
"The staff's salaries would be reduced, which would lead to late payments to wartime dealers and the legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two Senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details on the potential impact of automatic reductions on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of confiscation of the Ministry of Defense would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as a leading military force in the world."
"We are vehement against this draconic act," said the Senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not a matter of putting pressure on us."
"The confiscation is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its presence should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new senators' warnings will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or increase demands to remove the Pentagon from cuts remains to be expected.
Panetta has increasingly pronounced the possible cuts, although he has been able to gather many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defense painted a dark picture of what might arise - a military with bowl, but without core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's a firearm without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paperty, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech in the Pentagon.
"It is a power of conflict that lacks moral and alertness and is unable to accept it with potential opponents."
"She makes one actually angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details on how to "crease significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global capacity to use and make it possible to achieve an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to the removal, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation ballistic U-boats, the new Littorial Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle that Army and Marine need to replace the humvee.
If one stopped the further development and tests of the F35, this would save up to 80 trillion dollars in the next 10 years, but the supporters say that it is an important next step to upgrade so that possible dangers can be banned by China and other opponents.
How to Reveal a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how questionable and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The presidential candidate of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is concerned to master the accusations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides deny each other the lie.
The leadership of Penn State is accused of myid, since it is said that reports have been held back, after which a retired football trainer has sexually abused boys.
Last week an open microphone was heard, when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to the American President Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet-exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself a fool when he brought denials into circulation, which were quickly disproved by irresistible evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the violations in campaign financing related to the disguise of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that has triggered President Bill Clinton when he lied to Monica Lewinsky during his second term of office in the Oval Office regarding his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about smuggling in school and college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers have given their students the answers to the exams so that they can stand well even in their performance checks.
Mentoren, who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and smuggles are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies prove, we lie between 10 and 200 times each day.
Many of these lies, however, are considered to be an emergency lie.
Another study shows that strangers lie three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or "discovering lies" is one that is important for every person, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a social game such as shaads, where it is the goal to call "Hab You!", defying a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades from prestigious universities, which carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
A result of the research is that most old myths have been exposed to the lie.
Lies look into your eyes.
They do not always stutter, stump, kill, and tap.
This must not be concluded, however, that these liars are difficult to detect and detach.
An exercised liar can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the extensive and constantly growing field of de-torment. And it is clear that de-coupling a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to find out in our complex world, especially if the setting up or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration belongs to our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people, raising their interest and controlling their own emotions, and they feel intuitively how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people that men often "self-oriented" lies look out rather than women whose lies are more "orientated" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person was deprived as an evildoer, others feel less guilty to have lied to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
That's called "baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughter, the quality of the voice of their experimentor.
You should know better when someone usually triples with his foot constantly so that they do not wrong him when he triples his foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of striking verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that shrill, not as evidence of decantation.
People who deceive may be stifling when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet point towards the door or they lean toward the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the attitude talk", this deep, relaxing exhaling and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
The questioner often falsely signal that a recruitment interview is over, only to look for this relaxation after the attitude interview.
Also, pay attention to the language of your test person.
Scott Peterson's exploiter is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his killed wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceiving people can also use a dissensioning language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question in the whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... according to the best of knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptible than factual, which often causes the alarm bells to shrill.
There is no magic tool to detach lies, but you can learn skills thanks to which detachment is possible.
Thanks to these skills, everyone can become more rare victims of fraud, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after risk by delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama government has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, which has made the trade unions angry and at the same time calmed environmentalists, the pipeline building companies are trying to re-plan the project so that one can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax from TransCanada said that the company is still confident that the pipeline will finally be approved, even with another course.
This was followed by a announcement by the Foreign Ministry last week, after which a decision on a federal permit for the project would be postponed until the new possible course had been reviewed, which would avoid the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, opposite Fox News.
The new environmental review, which the Foreign Ministry has ordered, may postpone a decision by 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama announced last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and acknowledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline connects Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta Province to the refineries in Texas.
For this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, who are against the plan, consider the laws to force a departure from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project had little influence on the environment, but the source of the energy industry states that the Ministry's main auditor requested a separate probe of the review procedure focused on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008 is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is related to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused because she supposedly forced a toddler out of fear to break up
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have been given a sorcerable attack, which would have put her little daughter in such fear that she was over for fear.
The Tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "enhanced fear of strangers," said her family in front of the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was November 10 last year when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, wanted to break up to a family trip, a kindergarten.
While Kevin Monk got the car, Roseanna Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on his arm to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter down for a moment.
"One appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back to her arm," she said.
LaBelle exhorted the pregnant woman angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't put your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and started to beg - she used the F word and the A word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to tip water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle fell on the mother who was still wearing genevieve on the arm, and had to be held back by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to pass, she said.
Later the LaBelle family asked for an excuse in writing, but did not receive an answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not reply to calls for an opinion.
The appeal is for a non-closer compensation, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he doesn't charge a fee and the family plans to donate the money they get to children's cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is displayed to a kindergarten girl who wears an 18-month-old baby on his arm."
Climate Opportunity Braking the Economy
In the first year, where Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and black labour rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloas. It is the first year of which Mario López Valdez, who described himself as the initiator of change and who lacked great hopes for economic growth, is the government. However, because of the climatic contradictions, growth cannot be the cause but, on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses of millions in agriculture, but also limited the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter of this year, mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which was slowing down on other sectors of the economy.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the Frost, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially affected.
The decline in economic activity until November has led to a steady increase in unemployment in the Mexican state. In the first quarter of the year, the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment, as from January to March 55 053 inhabitants did not have Sinaloas, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the labour force. In the second quarter the unemployment rate increased to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74 000 unemployed people in Sinaloa.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year goes down to several factors. Economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented that the policies of public institutions indirectly explain growing unemployment.
"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, liquidity losses on the market due to the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in the congress, because for those who are forbidden to accumulate dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or use anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen. On the one hand, this is due to entry problems and on the other hand, because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here and find work here, which causes unemployment to rise," he says.
Black-collar work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if one takes into account the high proportion of black labour, which, according to INEGI 60.38 percent of those in the country who work without paying into the social security funds.
The low wages, the lowest wages in all of Mexico, come to unemployment and black labour, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaryía del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Office for Employment and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos by September, much less than the general government average, which amounts to 7375 pesos.
decrease in ADI
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, the biggest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to the Secretaryía de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI amounted to $630,597 from January to June, which corresponds to 87.74 percent compared to the $5 143,312 in the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretaryía de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Authority for Economic Development) has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, which mainly comes from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debts
In the light of the economic crisis, in July the state government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities.
Reactions
The first government year Mario López Valdé's government incapacity was evident to the representatives of entrepreneurship.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of the Manufacturing Industry in Mexico) stated that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"This year's economic activity in Sinaloa was really arduous. We have to work hard to regain this year's lost terrain and in 2012 we have to work twice. All efforts and especially the progress of the well-introduced government team have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López stated that events such as the Frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development more difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy which is not sufficiently moving to create an economic dynamics that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will conclude the year far below our expectations," he said.
Re-establishing vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexico’s Entrepreneur’s Association) in Sinaloa, stated that the state had to be led to more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will better direct the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas in which one can say that the government has acted more fully. What I can say is that has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg marijuana
To five years in prison and 100 days in prison, a resident of Navolato was sentenced to eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic's prosecutor's office announced that Omar Alexis was a drug retailer, Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a criminal offence against public health - here the property of marijuana, which is a trade deal.
According to the file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military in the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez road compared to guardpost No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug retailer drove into a white van in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the seized goods have been handed over to the district judge and the offender is still in the execution centre.
Debt for construction work
The social structures provided for in the Häbitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes run the risk of not being completed due to lack of resources or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The head of the Municipal Social Development Authority stated that although the building programmes are already advanced, they are now at risk, as the state government has not paid out the resources to them that exceed 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Up to now, only the Federación and the municipality would have contributed to the construction work, so a delay of the construction termination would be expected.
"12 million have to pay for them, and although the year is already ending, they have not given us a penny, and even though they had to pay us a part already in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already begun building work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the State had failed to fulfil its obligations, so that at the beginning of the government period the municipality had to take up a loan of 7 million, corresponding to the amount that the central government would have had to raise.
"We had already gone so far in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to obtain the funds that the State had not spent to participate in these programmes," he explained.
Although the public authorities were obliged to pay out these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance was asked to speed up the administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as quickly as possible.
"Almost 12 million have to pay for them, and although the year is already ending, they have not given us a penny."
The Court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The transition of analogs to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world over the last few years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints filed by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the Presidential Order and called for the switchover of analogs to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the decree of law with details on switching to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, since it did not receive the qualified majority of eight votes required to allow the court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
In the project for the action prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed that the decree of the law be declared unconstitutional, as the Comisión Federal de Telecomuniciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for the radio and television regulations concerned, which would therefore contradict the hierarchical principles and regulations.
The project was based only on Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Decree of Law. After the actions were adopted, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree of Law and put in place all activities to set up digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the project for which the Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the state government must not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration in general.
"I also do not believe that if one would do so would affect the independence of the regulatory body," she also recalled that for constitutional reasons the central government is responsible for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for the purpose of managing state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place all over the world in recent years, and it makes better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the use of digitalisation, which is a decision in the public interest which not only had technical aspects, "because they include economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "makes action of the entire system necessary, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the State, include a group of features that put the Constitution into the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out digital conversion, even though they had highly specialised facilities.
It cannot be concluded that the government would intervene in the powers of the Congress with the issue of the contested decree, because the laws adopted by the legislative act would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility of counting the list of votes in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is close to 27 percent, with 879 votes of 6074 not yet being counted.
The possibility of a single list of votes cast this year is a reality in the Michoacán elections, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminary (PRIP) the difference between the first and second place in the governorial elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded us that on the very last 9 November the Electoral Electoral de Michoacán (IEM) had adopted a number of regulations on the harmonisation of local regulations with the reforms of the federal states in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted either his political constitution or his electoral law or his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force on this round of elections. Governor Leone Godoy Rangle avoided publishing in the State Advisor within the time limits provided for with the argument to have objections or objections against it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislative authority and judged the State representative's voice on the constitutional reforms to be "ineffective and illegal" because he did not have the right to "decide or veto against it".
In an interview with María de los Ángeles Llanderal, Maria de los Ángeles Llanderal stated that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by Consejo General del IEM, the local electoral authority could partially or completely count the voting lists.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes included in one or more electoral packages may be counted in part.The results of the minutes do not match; the minutes on the score and calculation of votes are not valid or there is no possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the protocols.
In addition, the total sum of the fully completed electoral licences may be issued if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the second place, equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is an explicit request from the party or coalition president, which is the second of the abovementioned candidates.
The list of votes may also take place in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is found that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the electoral packages exposed to partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference between the first and the second place is close to 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 have not yet been counted by 923 electoral protocols.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés rang down this Sunday evening on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday the dead show and a death fair took place.
According to family members, the last will of the Supreme Lieutenant was that his ashes would be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila, along with the others who died in the accident, in an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force.
At twelve o'clock in the afternoon, the Oberstleutnant's ashes landed at the mourning Hall, which is located at the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were investigated at the Technical Institute of Saltillo. This body show was initiated by his former schoolmates of the technical Abitur and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, during his preparation of the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountain range. He had always said that way to his family and his friends," Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the Chief Lieutenant had filled all his dreams and she felt that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Zapopán Air Force, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it because they thought it would even make him dizzy on a truck. Nevertheless, he always strived to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good man. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and already wanted to welcome the whole family to him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán to graduate his family. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: a plane fly.
A final farewell
The chief captain of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was adopted with all honors under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López. Her honors were given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican air force, school principals and students of the Saltillo Technical Education Institute, where he studied in 1985 and considered excellent in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he had flown, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six others from the same authority crashed.
At 6 p.m., Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, met in order to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force from the funeral firm on the front of the barracks, led by the Major Jaime Martinez. There, his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers, were already expecting him.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot at Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military personnel introduced eleven persons who had been arrested in the same locality in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by shots in different parts of the body and a grace shot in an abandoned finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at the kilometre point 1.5 of the land road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the altitude of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers-by saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood up in lock.
As they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons within about three meters, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another, dressed in a white top.
Almost a meter away, the body of another person with red t-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the belly.
According to the information received on site, the three persons must have been murdered in another location, as no cartridge shells were found.
On the wall of the country house you can read inscriptions that write an organized criminal bond to another, and several shots were found in the wall and the door.
11 persons arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaryía de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) presented 11 persons, including a minor who was part of a crime scene that was mainly active in Cadereyta, and who are associated with kidnappings, murders, halconeo (men's hunts) and secret funerals.
According to the information published, eight persons were arrested and a prisoner was released in the Los Alveros settlement on 11 November.
Three real estates and one cell phone were secured. The arrested confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On 12 November at 6 p.m., on their guard round in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta, a car with no number plates with two inmates found.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13th at 14:00, one of her complicits was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to take refuge in the face of the military.
They will be charged with secret constituencies in the places of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday formation of the new Italian government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce the new government, which is to offer the forehead of the crisis that Italy has led to on the brink of economic collapse.
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce the new government, which is to offer the forehead of the crisis that Italy has led to on the brink of economic collapse.
A communication from the presidential palace announced that the Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano in order to confirm government education.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of government.
"I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times," said the former Commissioner for the EU.
Monti did not explicitly confirm government education, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The frame is now well locked up, he added.
In less than three days, Monti has managed to form a government, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the debt costs to an unbearable level.
The new government led by the former EU Commissioner Monti must adopt a tough savings package called for by the Euro-Politics to regain the popular confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti was reinforced by the changing market situation as a result of which Italian government bonds were taxed for 10 years with 7 percent interest rates, in line with the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue umbrella.
Emma Marcegglia, president of the Italian industrial association Confindustria, informed the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government in every way."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency situation.
Montis's chances of success were greatly increased by the support of the PDL party by Silvio Berlusconi, who had to step down on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Center-Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a majority of Technocrats-based government, which Monti is currently forming.
Parliament's support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular savings measures.
Resistance to its efforts or delaying reforms could again cause a devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks, with its indication that Montis was a disaster, also exerts pressure.
Monti began his discussions on Monday with political parties, trade unions and trade unions as well as with youth and women's organisations.
Tuesday evening will be the final round of meetings.
Monti was appointed by Napolitano this Sunday, which started an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After recently breathing at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would step down, critical borders were once again reached due to uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
A rescue of Italy with a government debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said his government must last until the next elections that are expected to take place in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, instead of prefering the elections.
Monti stated that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist of only technicians, a reference to their concerns in the light of the procedure imposed by the pressure of financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties make the involvement of people from political life complicated.
Spanish have more games than the Ticos
Of the 22 players from Spain, ten have more than 50 international games on the bat.
From pages Costa Ricas has only one of the 22 called up 50 games behind it.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendship game, which takes place today at 15.05 at the National Stadium of San José.
While World and European champions, number one on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a remarkable number of category A games, the three-colored team has only one defence player Michael Umana with more than 50 international games.
He scored this number on the last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Furie in complicated Eurocup and the football world championships will be added.
On the other hand, the Tico football clubs have few international encounters in the context of the Concaf, which is very low on the FIFA ranking.
We will see how the Spanish team draws their last register: The Torwart Iker Casillas, who reached a par with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizareta on the last Saturday, against England (Netherlands 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-colored team today and Spain will record a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, has 106.
Last week, Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from the UEFA, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magical number 100: the quoted Zubizareta with 126 and the middle towers of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number hundred is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side tower Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there came only five on over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the least games.
Less than 30 games are held in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the side of the national team come at less than 30 matches of Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even closer to the 20s border.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one recorded and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson did not have their debut yet.
The historic Torhüter of Spain is David Villa with 50 matches, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica Bryan Ruiz shot with nine most gates, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett moved Costa Rica to its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that is realized"
In the exclusive talk with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts in the National Stadium next Sunday.
For more than 20 years, they were expected, but the band assured that if they play in Costa Rica, a dream is realized for them.
This assured the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview last week from Brazil.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will appear in the National Stadium from 7.30 pm along with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read an extract from the conversation, whose complete copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costaric fans, a dream is realized when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is just the second time that we're playing in South and Central America, and so far it's been great.
I was only once for a holiday in Costa Rica. It is such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few days.
For us it is exciting to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely up and you experience the days before the concert.
What do you say your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
We took almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry to have used it until we got here.
Some people even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't this a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we spent over the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on some giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and are enthusiastic about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always been surfing for Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we have experienced about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour, you offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we don't set any limits either.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from every album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision we're going to play is not easy.
If we take two or three songs that we haven't played for a long time now, we can keep our concentration up better and they surprise us because they call us into memory the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think that's why the audience too.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
If you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I believe that none of us have imagined to play in a great rock band once, and that will last more than 20 years. That works like a dream.
We continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like ourselves and are enthusiastic about producing music.
We're lucky to be able to drive to the places in the world we've always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have taken an active part in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of big bands.
We're good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then, a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual if five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we're still playing together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound-gardes on their tour. We are pleased to be still friends with all of them, and it honors us to be part of this upcoming Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands last.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate our happiness in being alive, and we also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why we have opened up musical paths that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't go any better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew up made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to lose this game with huge masses who love your music.
As long as you think that the people have come because of the music, remember that you have to pay attention to the music and what it called for without being a famous rock star. That never interested us anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
For three years we were a band that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have used so long. We are still good at Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built up the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and therefore you chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. That’s why we’re curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live.
Why do you change the text of Yellow Ledbetter whenever you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing he likes.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
From so many+
Among the first ones to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, although it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I think we all don't feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, the bands I mentioned earlier include me, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they're still important today, I think that's great, because it's worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are doing better music now than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit lightly. But there are other songs such as The End or Justreathe, which are classified as very dark songs, even though they have something positive about them.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed play them, and they're very dark songs.
I think if you get older and something traumatic happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - this influences your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly embody this for me.
But I also think that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was sent to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his family doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is detained for 25 years for violations of human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including lung cancer, which is four times operated and controlled.
Alejandro Aguinaga, congress member and his personal doctor, told TV that Fujimori would investigate in Peruvian Hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedas Neoplásicas for three days to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body parts.
Aguinaga commented that, according to Fujimori, he could be congratulated for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish for this because he considered him innocent.
He has been operated on four times in lung cancer and he has lost 18 kilos of weight. Other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, were included in the doctor's office.
Fujimori has been located in Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, who was secretly working during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official order led by the Uruguay President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between both countries and discuss political issues in the region
Mujica meets his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón next Wednesday, according to the Uruguayian president, the highlight of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "applies to the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", announced the president of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is looking for support to Calderón regarding the incident with France, when French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a tax paradise list at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that still appear as tax havens, and this declaration was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request from his ambassador in the European country.
Since November Mexico has chaired the G20, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and industrialized countries in the world. Since January this year there is an agreement on the exchange of tax information on the prevention of double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the definition of agreements for the exchange of tax information to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which are countries which have not introduced all international tax cooperation standards.
At business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The cordary installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been tirelessly fighting for 25 years to save the Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but never in three dimensions until now: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he struggles for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which comes on the shop counters of all the world this month, was cut from the beginning to the properties of the portable console Ninth 3DS, with which can be played without a special glasses three-dimensional.
"Mario is the figure that has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," Omar Álvarez, who is responsible for the Spanish press specializing in Nintendo when presenting the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo that has been developed from the beginning for this console" because so far success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have already been adapted to existing titles.
Nintendo’s spokesman stressed that, even though it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "excellent" video game allowing a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "easy" to capture the less shocked users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" about the different game levels, which are becoming more and more difficult.
In addition, users can choose between a "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action in real time. However, to overcome the obstacles, without becoming victims of the "optical effects" must always be played three-dimensionally.
This trip Super Marios to the three-dimensional world also means returning the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo swirls up the fans of the Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last issues: The snorkeling installer must overcome risky platforms to free the Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom is committed to delivery of Portillos to the United States
The president of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would take the extradition of the former governor Alfonso Portillo, so that he would be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy for $70 million of money laundering.
Thus, the process of the US's request for delivery of Portillo ends so that it can be brought to court there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of judicial authority and government taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that he had not interfered with court decisions during his government and had accepted any extradition requests he was informed of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and severe physical injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloms is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former Prime Minister (2000 - 2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered when its legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and its human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign. This trial was preceded by extradition, but the Minister raised opposition and reinvigorated the case.
Trinikove has helped 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization was created to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinikove Social Assistance Organization have led to important results: in this quarter century, 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held yesterday in the former works buildings of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people took part.
Trinikove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems that were at risk of marginality.
At yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu, numerous responsible institutions and institutions participated, who worked with the association for 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions at electoral times confirmed the impartiality of the work done by Trinikove.
Apart from the president of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of former socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and former mayor and currently left-green city council Ricard Goma.
The great hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Works of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinikove was created in very difficult times and that today’s times are not less complicated, but he added that the work done so far "is a good foundation."
For the president of the Generalitat, Trinikove is an example of fighting against difficult circumstances that gives people hope in trouble.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does," he explained.
Occupied house where giant parties were organized was cleared
The houseowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve householders left the building yesterday afternoon without any resistance.
Everything points out that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 on Balmes Street have found an end.
Twelve people left the building that they had illegally occupied yesterday at noon and organized huge festivals in which the neighborhood had driven to despair. The room was placed on judicial arrangement without police intervention.
After the opening, the door lock was changed in order to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, entry will be controlled," the house manager confirmed.
The housekeepers, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took along the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. Furthermore, they painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and driven the tenants to despair.
In addition to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, said that her business had fallen by 80% since the start of her occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the housekeepers made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost in the discotheque 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the leisure room had been shown by the neighbors because of disturbances, while according to their statement of noise, not by the visitors of the disco, but by the householders and especially by the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and who, according to statements by the angry neighbors in the last few weeks, became more and more and more.
The person responsible for the discotheque declared that the harassment had been so great that she agreed with the owner of the building that she would not have to pay rents for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that they had received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
Last week, the president of the PP (Partido Popular People's Party) in Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had called for the building to be cleared immediately and to deal with the problems of civil cohabitation and the coming down of the district.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last months the housekeepers had been on all floors of the building and almost all the apartments had gone forward. In some it had even come to thefts.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to intervene against the social acts in the building."
Yesterday another building was cleared by the Catalan police in the Nou Barris district.
At 15.30 p.m., the police approached the Montral No. 35 street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people wanting to penetrate the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree to the invitation to tender in addition to the disputes over the fees.
The urban tendering procedure for the 16 gates opens up the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its reproach on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many again became the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in north-south direction, but goes up (mountain) and down (sea).
The classification Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, Yellowstone was no longer used in Central Park, but in the role of yogibär with wild boars.
So far, when the city issued a huge invitation in September, consisting of 16 competitions, it was for further access sites to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's what it's like or someone's planning to put gates in the country.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The call for tender is not only from an organizational point of view, but also in terms of reflection on the city the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It's almost a recursive theme that two members of this old-schooled caste, who meet in the elevator, can draw on.
And precisely this fact offers the fabric one of the rare similarities between what three Barcelona architects think about, and some university professors who applied for the project.
Miguel Rolldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, "it is necessary" to speak about the "front on the mountain" after attacking the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been carried out over the green apples.
"One should assume from the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Tower of Collserola" has a "lexical trap" in itself: it is not allowed to be "as accesses to a park, but as a limitation of areas on which action needs to be taken."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal to be an "intellectual challenge" which is "some danger".
Risks resulting from the "insecurity that today brings the design of a public space" following the experience of the 1980s, which had their "swan singing" in the field of the forum.
The first fear is its own limitation to what may be built.
"To limit anything always means to define the next step", that is, to exceed it.
"You need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [involving on the General Metropolitano (PGM)] plan can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is closer to the question, believes that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, can be understood "as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, who should not "snare on deaf ears" although he is grateful to the city administration that she has given his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city of the letter of conduct enables architects to participate in the debate, even though he expresses his "twine" at whether this technical profile should direct the multidisciplinary teams ("just the right", he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona points out that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, as the tendering conditions do not provide a global view of Collserola: "16 competitions have been written out in the cross section," he says, "on the mountain-sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that the area in its entirety is looking at."
At least in his case, this has led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strips directly above the Ronda de Dalt are so equipped throughout its length that a soft transition between city and green areas is created.
Casino forgives Jonás Larazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the agent of Casino Red freed the mayor of Monterrey from the trial that is directed against him for alleged extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larazábal is released after the envoy of Casino Red has given him before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which leads the trial against the mayor's brother of Monterrey for extortion.
After the attack on Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is supposed to force him to pay a money so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the Wetthaus.
After the criminal proceedings, the prosecution opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the panist mayor, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the Ministerio Público 3 and Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He remained there 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio Público rejected the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Centre because he thought he had bribed the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he remained in the middle security room for only a few hours, as there were threats of murder against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as a prisoner of the City Prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October he was sent to him by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, a prison order, which found that after the almost two months of investigations there were sufficient evidence to speak to Jonás guilty of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the Betthaus in order to open it in return.
This Monday, the agent of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez asked Judge José Luis Pecina to punish the mayor's brother, which is why he is set free in the next hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, García Gómez, asked whether he had done the damage and who the owner of the Wetthaus had pronounced his forgiveness. However, the lawyer held back the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larazábal is free to speak. Neither can any objections be made to the proceedings, nor is there any compensation required.
Larrazabal Bretón was released immediately after hearing the lawyer of the Wetthaus about 15.50 am.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, drove to the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison to inform Jonás that he had been released and would have his case filed.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of State for Aviation, will present details of the aircraft accident in which Minister Francisco Blake died and seven more people died.
The Secretaryía de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat für Kommunikation und Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation on the accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died indicate that the helicopter with its entire unscathed structure was hit directly against the ground without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the launch that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing was in contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, with the helicopter losing the hull seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also stated that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why he fulfilled all the requirements for the transport of the staff.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found in the field on which the machine had come down.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found in other places, the impact was the whole structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it fulfilled all conditions for passenger transport.
The area has an angle of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is important to obtain the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but it could take several months, perhaps even one year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for airplanes and auxiliary services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter of the Estado Mayor Presidencial had flown at flight speed and that the plane had fallen to a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points which should be taken into account during the investigation:
Viewing Air:
In line with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the visual flight. This means that the team should have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Conditions of weather:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the journey towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State some deep clouds were rising.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that due to the clouds the team had selected a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Check point:
The impact coordinates and the final radar recording of the helicopter agree. There may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or deviation from the flight route prior to impact.
Dissemination of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available up to the present time indicates that the helicopter was in a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter had been hit on the ground with its unscathed structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer at the place of the accident do not close on fire or explosion.
The final results indicate several soil contacts.
During the on-site tests, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The site is wasteful and has a sloping of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
After a merciless search in an area that went beyond the closed area at the place of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, strengthening the assumption that the unscathed aircraft structure was bombarded against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol for the detection of obesity gene
It leads a research project on the discovery of the obese gene in children and adolescents, which is supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene of obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth" with which the genetic markers are to be found in combination with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students from the postgraduate programme at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people may come to the sports places of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are conducted every Saturday from 8 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation began on the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and continued since 8 October on the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México).
If the target of 500 to 600 subjects is achieved, the study will continue on the sports ground of Independencia (South of the Capital District) and will be completed on the site of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He stated that the aim of the study was to learn the factors and role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the worldwide day of diabetes, he stated that it was intended that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 should fill out with the consent and under the supervision of their parents-related questionnaires.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family disease history to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or renal failure.
He further argued that on the above Saturdays the subjects (weight, size, waist size), would be measured, their blood pressure controlled, and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (trying to identify genes related to obesity in childhood) would be determined.
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out in the light of the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"Health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 showed that in almost six years, the proportion of obese boys had increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent. Overweight was also dramatically increased," said IMSS specialist.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico was different from that of other peoples.
He said that an average of 65 per cent of Indian-American, 30 per cent of European and 5 per cent of African descent was one (e) of Mexicans (in) and this was reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he stated that the genetics of obesity were inability to burn out the surplus of the energy (calories) that was taken to us, so that it would be stored in the form of fat.
The researcher stated that the direct benefit to the researchers was in a comprehensive study of the children in which they would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and the inner arm (atanthosis), which indicates the likelihood of metabolism and diabetes in the pre-stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and provided to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the measurement results and suggest changes to the lifestyle appropriate for preventing diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three fundamental factors that are responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, i.e. lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day before the television and using means of transport, instead of walking short paths.
The high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbohydrates (tamals, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from the UNAM prevents impact holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM develops modified asphaltes with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs from the road cover were respected, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 blowholes if the rainy season broke out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (City Area of the Valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Najera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warned and assured that if the laying out and maintenance of the asphalt coating were properly scrambled, the number of stroke holes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Schlaglöcher from a technical point of view", which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he was responsible developed modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, which, however, has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Najera said that this kind of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the street cover and thus avoid the occurrence of impact holes.
He stated that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound from which a part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalt - and the other part a low - the so-called malthene. Together they give the road cover its characteristic toughness behavior.
Teeth elasticity of asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very tough and almost solid at 50°C, while it becomes fragile at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of asphalt on the streets is not uniform, but changes on one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer explained.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had a flexible road cover, composed of six layers of materials, of which the last three were asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer of asphalt that is bathed in small asphalt and then fixed stones.
Every single stone of this wear layer has been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move forward and power is created, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"About the wear layer," he explained, "will be designed a last layer, the so-called carrying layer made of tiny stones, i.e. of sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a larger mechanical force than the wear layer and they must produce friction.
This road cover receives and distributes most of its forces, the bearing layer also requires an adequate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, above all, the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain gets wet, water penetrates the layer and occurs only difficult again. This causes a swelling of all layers of the road cover and as a result the occurrence of impact holes.
When a blowhole comes about," he said, "will first decompose the cover layer, while the wear layer will only be affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but is a process that should be maintained in the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the National Research System of Mexico said that the vehicle load was another important cause for the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road cover must always be related to the load of the vehicle and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent impact holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example, about asphalt emulsions that were already on the market in other countries and with which the impact holes could be repaired easily and without applying high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that have affected Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th mistitle.
Once again Valle del Cauca left empty when the crown for Miss Colombia was awarded.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winning stage, showing a silver crown and the band that she is exhibiting as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result received this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and cedar, the department is already on 14 mistitles and Melina is joined to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crown in their hands. Among the proclaimed Misses are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvare (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many ask today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite who had shown every performance that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing was she elected Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that is considered crucial to the jury's decision to appoint her to the First Miss is that she had not convinced her of the answer to the question "What book influenced you most and why?", which she had been asked by Martín Murillo Gómez by Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questioner:
"I read a lot, I think quite a lot of literature, I think it's a kind of civilizing, in the end I believe that the book that was most influential for my childhood is 'The Little Prince', a rather deep book.
At the moment I read 'Schuld and Atonement'. It's a book of universal culture that we should all read. I'm just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Leitations'.
An answer, which stood in little contradiction, first because of the term 'sich civilizing' and second because she had not specifically explained how each book she mentioned had influenced it.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina declared to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what needs to happen.
And for all people, read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the lover has been burned out of El Valle.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the favourites who had all the coincidences and who had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy Competition Easter, audience agreement about the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had jealously made what the queen was stressing, which therefore could not shine on stage."
And this was noticed during their first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and in their two elevators at the coronation celebration.
Although she was safe with both, she lacked the strength and the swing that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned to miss "shows that the candidate who wins most prizes during the competition does not eventually become queen."
In addition, Valle got out of the way at the end of the press -- a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the national beauty competition.
It will already have his reason that two days before the international jury was put together, Lucy Doughty explained that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beautifulness alone is not enough for Miss Colombia. One has to look beyond the physical and concentrate on social sensations, to ensure that she had worked on projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the terrier and fibrosis that were noticed in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good nutrition habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there was better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the belly, which I honestly could hardly notice, expressed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine considered that the faults of the woman from Valle del Cauca were the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to let her do them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay her."
Because of this prize, which is first awarded by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction was created after the appearance in the swim suit, which was to be true at night. It was smuggled that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to let them come to the enjoyment of the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that from today on Melina will start her year of rule, not as a queen, but as princess, a position that will allow her to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions at the appointment of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena.
Thus was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali entered history when the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November, a lophoscopist from Cali's investigative unit (CTI) went as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerza's Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Forces of Colombia): "Alfonso Cano" by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopists in the department of the CTI, this week, Eliazar González had a standby service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the necessary courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to frictions, i.e. the palms of his hands and feet.
In the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
A little big was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew to Cauca in the helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspicion was that one of the man who had led the oldest Guerrilla in the world could be. Therefore, he should take along the ten finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the examiner, he could not identify it because of his physical appearance, for this did not resemble the pictures he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, was not wearing glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a lupe, ink, a plant cellar and a flashlight, Eisazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had really seen it: it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defense Juan Carlos Pinzón that it was actually the head of the FARC.
On Track Search
For a dactyloscope of the Sijín in Cali, the tribute given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazazar González at a press conference on the use against "cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science without an error rate that can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
In their arrest, many offenders present false ID cards or they have none.
We take the fingerprints from them and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house during a theft, because the thief had just picked himself up with his hand at this point when he pulled out a safe filled with jewelry and money.
"Waunds are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate for the loss of fingerprints. But in this case we were able to take the impression of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he remembered.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or burdened.
A dead man was recently found surrounded by beak bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be suspicious, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle agreed.
Although this does not guarantee that this is the murderer, it is associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI Dactyloscopeist stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reactions would be taken from the object."
When they appear, a plant kerosene or a tape is used for taking.
After that, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Staff Office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identity papers," said CTI's expert.
He said not everything was the way it was shown in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold is what shines, neither is everything you touch a fingerprint.
But still it can be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "embatches" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators collided in tents on the Zuccotti Square.
A large number of them followed the emerald order and moved their location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement asked the New York authorities on Tuesday when, with a judicial arrangement, they again tried to enter the Manhattan Square after they had been cleared from the square in the morning gray and had tried to occupy another place on Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators forced themselves before the Zuccotti Square, on which they wanted to make entry with a judicial arrangement that allowed the "embattled" to return tents at this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement held on the space order and occupied a park further north of the city where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp in the square, we find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sitting-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray argued that the response of the "embatts" to the emancipation of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York, came to court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent clearance of the place and allowing the demonstrators to take the tents.
In addition, the "embattled" occupied a new park located at the junction of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is the property of Trinity Church.
They could occupy the place for at least one hour, but after that the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not give precise figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he also saw several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that hundreds of people would have found themselves at this point, where religious leaders were also assigned as a sign of their support to the members of the movement and to mediate with the police.
In the meantime, the Zucotti Square (a private property site) remains closed in the expectation of a judicial hearing that is still scheduled for this Tuesday and in which the legality of the premises held in the morning gray is to be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators who were driven by the square carried photocopies of this judicial order with them and distributed them. They even gave them some police officers who guarded the place, which resulted in "some little collisions", as Bray reported who had indicated some police had beaten demonstrators.
The court order forbids the authorities to clear members of Occupy Wall Street from the square as well as the use of "laws adopted after the occupation and prohibit the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg makes it clear to the press that due to this judicial arrangement the opening of the square for public transport and the demonstrators had been lifted. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the premises of the Zucotti Square, which had been held in the dawn of the morning, and which had been decided that the demonstrators were "infringing justice."
Bloomberg stated that he had given the order to leave the place because it had "turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people", because "some business would have received threats" and the residents feared "for their quality of life".
"The room in the dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the interests of the North American workers and is not interested in protecting the interests of the North American workers," added the spokesman for the movement who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of the press".
The heads of Occupy Wall Street informed them that they were thinking of organizing "great actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have already taken since September 17th.
Pamela Anderson is in the TV Christmas show the Virgin Mary
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, they will appear on December 1 in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Alles assistant in "Home Improvement", rescuer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will perform on December 1 in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and a very special virgin Maria's life.
Today, CTV spread images of the television program in which Anderson, who also appears as a Virgin Mary with a doll in the lap, together with her former husband, the drummer player of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears as a Virgin Mary with a doll in the lap that Jesus is supposed to represent.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently worked as a presenter in the show "My Violet Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, as Jesus.
CTV's Christmas program is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far away from this controversy.
Bublé had recently referred to North American Kim Cardashian as "hear" at one of his New York concerts.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, which has still been in recovery after the destructive earthquake that led into a nuclear crisis, and the worst catastrophe Japan had experienced in World War II.
The government’s initial estimates in Tokyo assessed the material damage to $300,000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of the year, the gross domestic product data from July to September were used to finalize this chapter: GDP grew 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% to the annual rate.
The value measured in the second quarter - starting in Japan in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can partly be explained by the machine sale for the reconstruction of the areas destroyed by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decrease by 0.9% in capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the real turnaround of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynsian attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan is awakened in particular thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, fueled by the growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - has moved into one of the investor's "currency currencies" that flee before the eurozone's debt crisis and the sad forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is like a gravestone on the accounts of the export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the major technology producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony brought their weak business results back to Yen's quotation from July to September.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"One must pay attention to the persistent risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of floods in Thailand and the rapid recovery of the yen," said yesterday, the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The perspectives are really not very uplifting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had demonstrated clearer signs of slowing down economic development in September.
The indicator that assumes the turning points of the world economy revealed that the brakes were drawn at the largest economic potential.
Because he fell by four tenths to the 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro zone is even below this average value, which is 100 after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says that the austerity measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk premiums of peripheral countries and wide-ranging uncertainty, Greece is also further lost in the labyrinth that results from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is a response to the pressure from Brussels rather than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon during his appointment might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new savings measures and in no case withdraw his request for new elections at the scheduled date of February 19.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," said Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will reach its height tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, the reform of disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not leave out any doubt about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but otherwise to nothing."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that needs to unlock the 8000 million people who urgently need Athens. He made it clear that he would not approve of a declaration of commitment on the fulfilment of the savings measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated because of the effects of poker play with Papandreu referendum, confirmed yesterday that its demand was not to shake: Economic aid would not be signed if the new government and leaders of the most important Greek parties would sign "a clear written agreement not as soon as possible".
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Economics, Amadeu Altafaj, stated that the Troika inspectors returned to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is "necessary for the payment of the sixth section" of EUR 8000 million", although there is no final date.
The Greek Knäuel still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "predominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has reached a dominant position worldwide in the role of micro-financing".
The Queen Sofía of Spain reminded yesterday that Spain has developed into the second donor of this means of international cooperation in the last two decades. Its "Wesen" rests on the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind based on trust in mankind".
Yesterday, the Queen announced the fifth World Summit on Small Loans in Valladolid. She was convinced that it would be "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely indispensable" to reach the millennium goals set by the United Nations by the year 2015 and "in particular the goal of the number of people who have to live with incomes of less than one dollar a day, that is below the poverty limit".
Spain also continues to "work" on extending the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task responsibly," said Queen Sofia, hoping that the initiatives and contributions that will take place from the summit that lasts until Thursday, "will guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "compared with many challenges."
The summit on microcredit is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for "two basic objectives".
The Queen stated that it was intended that 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty line.
The concept of microcredit dates back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago" in Spain and the rest of the world, which the Queen Sofia considers to be an "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financing instrument described it as a "admirable idealist who had dedicated herself to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the local loan strategy.
One year later, this experience followed the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. All of us "can observe continuous further development", said the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday gave her the assessment as the "head of the family" in Valladolid and as "fearer of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and search for solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical command" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid to times of economic boom, because it was a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez felt that the microcredit was a "serious and rigorous policy for the extermination of poverty" and that the governments of the industrialised countries now had to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, accused "the success", "marginized" people, " always standing in front of closed doors" "Hoffnung" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city who "opened their gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes that EU Presidents vote on a general vote.
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday 14 November in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was originally not provided for in the programme, but was implemented in autumn, in particular in order to provide those activists who today and possibly Italy as too lax in government policy.
The Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
Among 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against it, ten had abstained.
For several minutes, the standing ovation which, due to their interventional events, initially took Angela Merkel and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble did not raise any doubts on the part of the three European Finance Ministers.
The chancellor's main idea, as well as the requests, has the following slogan: the response to the crisis is not less, but more Europe.
Not only because Europe means peace but also that new millions of jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected by a modification of the Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policies of the countries of the Eurozone, which would also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote" to give a face to Europe".
However, this is definitely one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which Wolfgang Schäuble Pate clearly stood.
Certainly it is not likely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, the delegates in an overwhelming majority rejected the proposal for the weighting of each country in the Governing Council in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously gave rise to a first-time strengthening of Germany's position.
The chancellor, who is concerned with calming the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or of the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
To the extent that the European request for the importance of "German-French friendship" is devoted to a point, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
For this reminds us that Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in the case of disease reports?
According to family aid, UMP and the government are now attacking the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will come to Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family aid fund and will present a speech on the subject of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state - which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to put the economy under trial, on the other hand, it is no less a prelude to an axis of the right presidential campaign, that the majority will concentrate on workers' disease reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government is monitoring the introduction of a fourth calendar day before taking into account a health report for employees in the private sector.
In good German this means that without the approval of the specific company, a sick worker would lose the wage of four days, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to conjure up anger, but would help to bring 280 million euros.
And those who went along with another measure were rather symbolic: to give the public officials an unfavorable karenztag in the case of illness (up to now there is no period for them to do so, contrary to the three days in the private sector, no karenz).
While these questions are under discussion, the majority is also reinvigorating the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with abstinence.
"Controlls will be much more important, and in addition, they should be refunded when this is demanded," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November in front of the microphone of the transmitter RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of disease reports seem a little unproportional.
In fact, it has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 as well as of political offensives that have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer sick more than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us begin with the national figures.
According to CNAM, more than 237 million euros were paid daily payments in 2006.
According to the health care research and documentation institute, day-to-day payments amounted to 11.3 billion euros (5% of health expenditure) in 2008.
This amount fell to 46% regarding maternity leave as well as work accidents and 54% on sickness leave, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
And thus 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the French received an average of only 14.5 days of illness.
One average, which covers certain differences: another, published in 2007, by Monster.com, Career Planning Website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 surveyed French workers claimed that they did not take a single sick day.
Another study, which was recorded this time by health insurance, makes clear that 37% of sick reports were shorter than 8 days in 2010, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
In comparison with their neighbours in Europe, French workers do not tend to tend to be incapacity elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French Research Centre (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global rate of absence (disease or otherwise justified) was oscillate in France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in sick reports is a dimly small proportion of black labour.
With regard to fraud, only a weak extent is achieved here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 shows that there are sysmatic controls in cases of disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for training and training of technicians and engineers) found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 of the reported short-term sick reports, which are mentioned in 37,050 cases", were not justified or too long".
In the case of systematically controlled disease reports of more than 45 days duration, less than 1.2 million 11% were "adapted or unjustified" cases, i.e. 132,000.
In total, this makes 169.000 "unfounded" cases for several million workers who have filed a disease report.
A figure which represents only a weak extent compared, for example, to that of the black labour.
According to UMP member Dominique Tian, author of a technical report on this issue published in July, this represents between EUR 9 and 15 billion of tax losses per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the defraud of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to detain its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced in front of Parliament that the Union's government had failed to accomplish this task for a hundred days.
"We need support from our European partners as well as a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government in his first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the European Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the eurozone was at stake" as it added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's national deficit to the 9% of gross domestic product from today until the end of the year, after which it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new savings measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent on Monday to the already approved measures regarding an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but had presupposed that his party would not obtain additional savings.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a parliament of his party New Democracy.
He had agreed with the rules of reduction of budget deficit and debt, as well as with the fight against waste, but he was hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented IMF and EU from issuing the necessary loan over EUR 8 billion without written guarantee from all parties to support the planned measures, had answered Antonio Samaras that his word was sufficient and he would not sign anything under pressure from offices.
Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalized, such as an expert body
The Canadians live in refusal of death, as a report by the Royal Society of Canada shows
The body stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated in order to provide the best pain-reducing means, and this also went beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal towards death.
Only 9% of the Canadians can actually agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and meet divisions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada involving six experts involved in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanying suicide and euthanasia where this choice is taking place, in patients who are considered capable of making such a decision.
As a start, the experts quote a recently published survey of the independent company EIU, which compared the death quality in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself in 10th place, the study notes that "medical mortality in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the subject of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of the Canadians have no access to pain-killing drugs, so the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report to us.
And despite the majority desire of the Canadians to die at home, at the end 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
From the country as a whole, the rate is highest at 86% in hospital cases in Quebec.
In the delicate question of euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to the conclusion that the position of the federal government, which has already done so, is not intended to make any changes to the criminal law regarding euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
However, according to the experts who have inspected all the countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would involve abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of uncompetent or non-voting persons.
On the contrary, there are much more cases of such wrongdoing especially in countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as yesterday Jocelyn Downie, co-signist of the report, confirmed in a teleconferencing.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Even accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although here clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadian Supports Euthanation
Let us bear in mind that, according to an Angus-Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already been in favour of euthanasia, as they believe that this would allow people to ease their suffering at the end of their life course.
And 66% believe that the facts of a legalisation of euthanasia do not lead to the message that the lives of older or disabled people are of less value.
As regards the persons who have already practiced an accompanying suicide, the respondents at 41% consider that they should not be persecuted criminally.
As far as maintaining or adjusting the drug in patients is concerned, the situation is less clear, according to the rapporteurs of the report.
Similarly, they suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the suspension of the funds for which a legally valid rejection was made should not be considered criminal.
The expert body also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the end of their lives, and to fear this without criminal persecution.
The body stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated with regard to pain-reducing treatment in order to provide the best pain-reducing means, and this also goes beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the means of pain relief or life-retirement which have already been used in the Canadian health care institutions, the body calls for at least consideration of them, as they were as little as the euthanasia used to reduce physical pain and they are dependent on the same procedures.
Subjects of other experts
Some experts in the field of health have already made reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described the attitude of the reporting experts, among other things, as it did not limit the practice of euthanasia among the sick in the final phase.
"This opens the doors to a situation in which anyone who is tired of life and over 18 years of age is invited to ask another person to assist him in his suicide," says RA Deschamps, who had seen a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to put the individual's own responsibility over all other values involved in the social sphere of society.
But now, he says, would there be "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report which she titulated as "Pro-Euthanasia-Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is in particular in doubt about the information on the non-provision of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls President Assad to leave power
Damascus is launching a "complot"
Syria is also isolated
The partisans Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assads, however, which, thanks to Russia's support and which shows itself a "complot" against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before Syria's exclusion from the Arab League, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of President Assad's resignation.
King Abdullah II. From Jordan, yesterday, the official Arab Prime Minister who had asked President Bashar al-Assad to "put down his power of office in Syria" in which the forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"If Bashar were interested in his country at heart, he would withdraw, but in addition, he should create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the King of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat leader Ahmet Davutoglu had complained that the Turkish mediation attempts directed to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy this need to go," he said, referring to Syria, the neighboring country, to which Turkey is taking a constantly rougher attitude.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "improvement of the Consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"International Community, United States, EU, Arab League and countries like Turkey have hit an ever sharper tone in view of the repressions in Syria," says Mark Toner, a spokesman of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government power have died in the Dar'a region in southern Syria, so the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH announced.
Two other civilians, according to this NGO, had died in the besieged city of Him in "Suss changes and severe bombings around Jobar".
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless considered that the country's tax on the end of the crisis.
By the way, he has been emphatically responding to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from his tasks, which he considers to be a "hazardous step".
Syria" would not yield," he added under the threat that "the plots forged against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now examining a "protection mechanism for civilians" and is seeking to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé had also expressed his support for the deployment of UN observers in order to protect civilians from regime repression that he encapsulated in his "Paranoia".
An open-plan new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan on the rise of crisis on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, anticipated withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
The Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergej Lawrow has considered the Arab League's decision yesterday to be "uncorrect" in order to guard against any sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already encouraged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to be sacrificed
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that requires "offers" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former Commissioner of the EU had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before the meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which is rather strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had waited for Mario Monti to make a vote of confidence to Parliament until Friday in order to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will be reflected in the presentation of a removal list presented by M. Monti, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that the yesterday's nervousness of stock markets and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government as well as a government programme, he stressed that it was "certain that the markets would show themselves clear and understanding".
His appointment by the President was originally welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had once again increased, especially after an unexpected industrial production decline in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister was supposed to establish a staff made up of mainly technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist by 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Since taking up his role, M. Monti has committed itself to working in every urgency within the meaning of the objective to make Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for the EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis against the Italian economy itself does not change, taking account of the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its target of budgetary compensation in 2013, despite the savings plans that have been taken up in recent months, has in particular requested new challenges.
Emma Marcegglia, Chief of Chiefs of Italy, who will meet with Monti on Tuesday, is also in line with the need for economic growth," because a country that has no growth to show that is not capable of respecting deficitary indicators".
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "change of epoch" in Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "requiring of trustworthiness" as well as a "other Italy", says the editorial authors.
The most unknown is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy will now have to pay for 200 billion euros of government bonds until April 2012.
Russian scientist helps the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Vjasheslaw Danilenko, has helped Iran to develop an explosive capsule that can be used with a nuclear weapon, so on Monday confirmed an American NGO specialized in nuclear risks.
The Institute of Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency AIEA and other documents based on this UN agency to identify this scientist.
The AIEA had reported its "serious concern" last week on the occasion of a "opportunity military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study by the ISIS AIEA documents, the Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he is said to have left the center to set up a company in Kiev that produces "Nano-diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA said that Iranian development was supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only out of the reach of this technology but also, as a member of the Agency reported, had worked his entire career over the essential part of this technology directly on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes against Muslims have risen by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes, according to FBI statistics published on Monday, have either declined slightly or increased little during the same period.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased by 49% from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, whereas an 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decline in crimes directed against Jews, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "has-motivated crimes" rose to 6,628 cases in very weak measure, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences of motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is alarming to see these crimes and crimes grow again," stressed the Human Rights Organisation Human Rights First.The rise in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a Communiqué.
"For a long time, Human Rights First had stressed that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," Paul Legendre, a responsible of the organization, added.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, assuming that this could be carried out in an improvement in the police attitude towards the "Hasscrime".
The "Hasscrime" is in American federal law as an inheritance from the epoch of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted following the death of Martin Luther Kings in order to punish acts of violence directed against race, skin color, religion or descent and now involve crimes of sexuality.
Twitter is changing the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
On Monday, the Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to enable its users, in particular, to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service more similar to those of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" enable better readable live tracking of the activities of other "Twitters", the Internet users whose messages are being tracked and followed by your messages.
This enables them to find out whether they allow them to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet dissemination on Monday"in August with a small percentage of users", said Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner before the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for his little instinctive operation, equipped with somewhat esothermal text (RT for the referenced repetition of the contribution of another person). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comarable a cellui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users debated this innovation with the help of certain "tweets".
"This is useless, urgent and similar to too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Function"Activity" will help me track certain elements of my Flux twitters better," stated @dannykron current.
Austria
Registration of a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian-Democratic Coalition, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution to reduce public deficits and to avoid any degradation by rating agencies in the top-bonity of Austria (AAA).
It was the social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian government debt is 74.6%, thus far above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but significantly below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria's affordability did not fall on a blow from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros of interest each year," said Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Austria also calls for the Brussels summit of the Eurozone Member States of 26 October: Heads of State and Government at that time required the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to the public account balance into the Constitution or by adopting an equivalent law.
The measures taken by the Austrian government are similar to the "German model", since Germany had been the first European country to include such a "rule" in the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and as of 2017, the state's structural budget deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, while regional states as well as municipalities should have balanced households.
The aim is to reduce budgetary debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Stronger Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention in the monetary markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that Japanese authority would intervene again on the currency markets if the yen continued to rise.
If we are to establish an excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen, we will intervene just as we did the last time," M. Noda said in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was again close to the historical levels that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31st.
On that day Tokyo had sold massive yen against dollars to reduce the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is about to tax a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has regularly risen over it, dipped by purchases of investors who consider the yen to be "flight-value" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen under 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro has swung under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that have triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar recorded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This fearfire of the Japanese currency is damaging the exports of the archipelago, since it is expensive for the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value of Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them into national currencies.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and the tsunami on March 11 that destroyed the Tohoku region (northosts)," emphasizes M. Noda, who fears that this increase in the yen could kill the weak upturn already in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter of -1.5% compared to the previous quarter for the first time this year, the third world economic power has once again gained a boost in exports and consumption of the "plombed" households caused by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the increase of the yen does not reflect the economic foundations of Japan.
Mr Jun Azumi, for his part, asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Committee on Tuesday to take all possible measures to eliminate the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, has, however, informed of the fact that BoJ had already launched "appropriate measures" in order to make it clear that there is no need for additional monetary restraint on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the Notenbank had increased its government bonds by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to eliminate the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) cover amounts it had spent on various purchases of financial titles in order to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rate feet fast up, stock exchanges make withdrawers
The risk of infection of the debt crisis constantly undermines the European indicators.
Despite the take-up of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weak countries continue to increase steadily.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, also drifted off this Tuesday, 15 November a little more in negative order.
In Paris the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt decreased by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"As a result of the new tensions regarding the yields of government bonds in the euro area in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to spend part of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which, in turn, is suffering from the renewed fear of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues to persist, had closed with a rise of 0.7%.
""Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its eyes on Europe, and trade moves on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern over the future of the euro zone is damaging the single currency that continues its boss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was 1.3570 Dollars, so it gave up 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange brokers, it has declined after the CDU, party of chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered in the congress on Monday, had accepted an application, which in particular provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to withdraw from the Eurozone without simultaneously leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Italy's and Spain's loans are still at a very alarming level.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of the Italian bonds reached 6,85% 10 years, the Spanish title matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed investors' fears.
The future Italian government leader Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by the debt burden in Italy.
For its part, the new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October were "the main task" of his government.
Spain is located in the vision of the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place on Sunday.
The interest rate bar ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historical high.
Expected eurozone growth rates
Statistically, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% of household consumption in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office of INSEE had revised the figures for the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that is most alarmed by economic experts.
Germany, for its part, had a 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first increase in the euro area is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail about dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
Availability and costs of electricity affect purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies in direct measure.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting on the occasion, to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will bear fruit only if it sins the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, demographic evolution is driving forward a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, a huge proportion of the world's population should not give up a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to reduce the shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to refrain from nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision of the need to find a substitute source of substitution, nor in Switzerland, which has just intended to build only nuclear power stations of the last generation.
In contrast, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name only a few countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, decided to join their park with another unit by re-introducing the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even though the model of renewable energy sources is occasionally presented as an example, reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice in Berlin will be reflected in the form of an increase in the electricity price, an increased energy dependence on imports of gas, especially on Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power stations.
The totality of these unhappy effects will already make itself felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to thought.
Denmark is, on the one hand, European leaders in the wind, from which it refers 30% of its electricity; on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas used alternately with wind energy; on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher each than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill in contrast to our French households.
Since the price of energy in the globalized economy is a key factor in competitiveness and a stability fund for industry on a national basis, French companies have an advantage because of the lowest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the energy price, leaving the noble statements about the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power as an illusion.
Surveys showed that the price of the large majority of French people is as little to pay as it shows resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Let us see that the energy policy of our country has enabled us to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Because of its strong export character, it brings a multitude of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France decided to withdraw from nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would fall victim and the annual EUR 6 billion in investment goods and nuclear exports would be more and more shrinking.
What electrician would be responsible for the operation of an EPR designed for sixty years if the decline of its producer was preprogrammed?
In order to solve the energetic equation one must admit that there is just as little one like a devil's work a miracle tool for generating electricity.
The CO2 low-carbon solutions developed by the company Areva demonstrate the complementarity of energy sources with nuclear power and renewable energy.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority carrying out non-compromised and transparent controls in existing plants such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, have to be possessed by the safety presentation.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disturbances.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has arrived under normal operating conditions; thus, it was without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was conjured up by reactor construction as well as indebted human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused by diurnal masses, which caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident as it had done according to the two previous ones.
As a fruit of this approach and a cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft which enables it to withstand such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical technicians to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is indispensable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that would also determine the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overburdenment of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France itself had called itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students had marked the weekly shows that the Interior Minister had casually announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France had no need for talents, mares or waiters from abroad."
But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
This is because there is a broad consensus between the right and the left.
From the right the tone of Jacques Chirac was struck, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrants, should not be a problem for a country", from the left by Michel Rocard, who had explained in 1990, could not take France's entire poverty in the world".
The only difference exists in the degree of grossness
The fear of invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumber was shared by both the right and the left in 2005.
Immigrants were perceived as a burden on the economy and the French society.
The only difference exists in the degree of grossness to be accorded to immigrants.
In his program Francois Hollande is limited to banalities that point to allowing partnership development to solve our "migration problems".
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present in a recently published work that summarizes the latest findings regarding immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists regarding the positive influence of immigrants' flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.
Limiting immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears of the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to substitute the domestic workers, especially those less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than the local labour force, as they carry out major occupations in sectors that are unloaded in the workplace.
The low-qualified immigrants work in sectors that have little to do with domestic labour force workers who are more skilled among immigrants in dynamic sectors where training is not comparable to the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, so this complementarity also results in a positive effect between locals and migrants on wages and national labour market situations.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the rate of immigration will result in a partial, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this, without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants (highly the proportion of civilian immigrants among American Nobel Laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, in European countries, at an average of about 1% of the general budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that a person who migrates to Germany at the age of 30 averages a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around 150.000 euros to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to create the missing intersections with his teeth at the start of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which should deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after their invention in Athens over two thousand years ago, had passed over the tragedy of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme One in Greece.
Some probably believed that it was sufficient to exercise the right to vote, in the directest way possible, to see democracy defeating its enemies once and for all.
One has known since Napoleon "the little one" that this was a characteristic of mental attitude.
The general right of election, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can as well become the "impression instrument", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot expressed at that time.
No, democracy requires far more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of violence, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a case law.
The crisis in Europe, in which we are in, is an economic crisis, but it is as much a political and democratic crisis as ever.
In this respect, the change of mind of the Greek True-Falsch referendum would have had a double pervasive character: once the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also for those of the disturbing feeling of their impossibility, of their impatience.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer aim in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to push for a success of the national referendum, which has been organised depending on the needs and the wrong order.
A release for the European sole ruler or a leap with associated eyes into the void of nationalist withdrawal: a big choice for the citizen!
No, we want hackebeil, but we want a collective task, with full right, clear and steady, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - they do not know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and this is happening in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole, which is bending to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies suffering from its powerlessness and its lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that has been humiliated at international level.
One is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - it is all of Europe that gradually loses its sovereignty, and thus each of the nations associated with it.
The urgency is to give people's sovereignty back the leadership of the European project.
For it is up to all Europeans to reduce the burden of their debts, to free themselves from the markets and to create a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level, which cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without surely leading us to ruin.
After this proposal has been fought for a long time by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone is now pushing for European economic governance.
Intellect.
However, without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it suggests to the citizens - this would be a further folly and a further culprit.
We must take on a new stage of European integration.
In order to create the Republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of the interests alone could not do enough here.
This instruction remains valid.
We must form a Europe that is better integrated at an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" smartcards become general good
The World Chipcard Fair opens its doors in an optimistic position on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is the contactless technology, which allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million previously sold one year earlier, this year 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide!
Their market share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe wins in terms of contactless payment on land, after it has been hindered for a long time from the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: Only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
However, consumer markets are steaming.
Carrefour has therefore emitted 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move faster speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically hand over their customers bank cards equipped with contactless chip in the future," Gérard Nébooy, Director General of Visa Europe France, announces.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first stage on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
The NFC technology (Near Field Communication) required to carry out these transactions has so far been equipped with a disappearing percentage of devices.
"They're in delay."
"But they should be experiencing a real upward development at least next year."
"In 2012, we expect to sell from 80 to 120 million units worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees should be equipped with a capsule allowing contactless payment.
The BCCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also promised yesterday to prepare the market launch of an offer that allows their customers to make contactless payment by mobile phone.
Terrorist Front understands itself, from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationship between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspected relationships between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to confirm themselves.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Secretary of State Abdelboder Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "acquired certainty".
"The way in which both organizations proceed and the relations of secret services point to clear cooperation," he explained without further detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation of the abduction of two French people in Niger last January has promoted interfaces to days.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by followers of the Aqmi, are to have been killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several telephone chips in the ruins at the place of use that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the guided telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who for a long time had stopped in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a progress, but it is undoubtedly necessary to wait for more clear evidence before you can talk about an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"But it's imaginable."
"For years now, it has been known that the sect refers to financial and intellectual support from offices and that it is increasingly active," explains the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuvo.
In these last months, these "assistances" have become increasingly apparent, as have the speeches and the operation modes of Boko Harem, which now point to the removal of suicide offenders and the use of ever more complex explosives bearing the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to begin with Washington, has been exerting pressure on Abuja since then, in order to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have for a long time considered the grouping over as a community of Illuminati, which should not be given special attention.
Faster success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school as well as the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means as much as "the Western education is a shame" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this mediocre region, the merger is experiencing rapid successes.
It politicalises itself and demands strict compliance with the Sharia, while the activists associated with it work in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists initially have churches, bars and authorities in the visor.
In 2009, Boko Haram's activists were particularly active in strengthening attacks against the Commissioners.
However, the response from Abuja is as usual differentiated.
The army surrounds the city, one counts 800 dead.
The prisoner Muhammad Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas she became known for an attack in Jos, which demanded 80 human lives, then she became another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was awarded the debt of a suicide act that occurred in the secure U.S. police headquarters in Abuja - the first of his kind.
In August, the United Nations local seat is a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which will lead from Mauritania to Nigeria, to Somalia, has troubled all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied the Somalis of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned about Boko Harem on the occasion of a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria and showed himself ready to say all the information."
The world, the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-weaked America lead a complex world with simple, not to say, simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates in this way, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a number of days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their competitors have been making their thunderous statements as well as their statements regarding the auspeenpolitik, a traditional Republican focus.
About China, Iran and Israel's help - often not supported in any way - slogans fall.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" the highest-class mid-Romney threatened to quote the Chinese in front of the WTO and to examine them as the leading topic in an America, which is attracted to Asia by the migration of all industries.
He said that if this was to imply the initiation of a trade war, he would.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China under Obama and only candidate who seems to have a matured vision of auspeenpolitik, almost cut off the air with regard to his emotional flattering gesture.
He had called for a hand-resistant but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also the current approach of Obama).
But Huntsman will not be heard because he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's Ebony
Romney had also praised military beatings against Iran if sanctions were to fail to stop the nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I order Iran to stop," he would have sounded.
"When Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
He also promised Israel increased military aid and charged Obama with being guilty of this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, who is second highest-placed candidate, is in his view a disgraceful act of ignorance.
Recently, he called on the Chinese military threat to counter, as Beijing"s attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to pay attention to the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military beatings against Iran, claims to be willing to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The attack on torture against the suspected terrorists of Obama 2009 was also supported by Cain, Perry and Michele Bachmann.
You are far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a political heavyweight.
To meet the current presidential opponents, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all that, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give water in his wine, which concerned the subject of antiterror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve discussion with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "young" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of weakness.
However, this contradiction is not quite so unenforced.
The population is more estimated to be the positive balance of the National Security Under Obama that Bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, she has been guarding herself against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama is more surprised by his argument that America needs to be rebuilt economically to bring its leadership back to life.
Nord Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, was put into operation.
It is intended to provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to commit this event with glamorous and Gloria.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended last Tuesday at the Baltic Sea Coast under orchestral sounding and at fine-tasting buffet the initiation of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly with each other under sea level.
German chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon, and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically taken the wheel of the valve, which transports the Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year are to be delivered to Western Europe by a first pipeline of 1.224 km length, which connects the Saint Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline which allows a total delivery of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of total French consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already let the eventuality of the construction of a third line sound on your own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this huge building works looks like a victory.
The project was strongly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will enable direct gas supply to Germany, while avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine).
For this reason, these two countries lose a little power: for them it is now becoming more difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close entry to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most committed to the debate, had not been reeled back to compare the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of decommissioning European energy, as the project has taken a break between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has in hardly five years completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas deposits tend to be.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new arteries that connects us organically," said François Fillon, at the initiation of the gas pipeline by pointing out to what extent the large gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All of this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom-Managers represented in Lubmin with regard to the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line consists of steel with concrete coating to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed at about 200 m deep.
During its construction, mine fields dating back to World War II had to be removed.
"Some hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed in a careful manner," said Jens Müller, spokesperson of the North Stream society.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect fauna and flora.
The line is a long hose made of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither by valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers took away from it, as the Swedes had little intention of seeing a Russian state society settled in a permanent manner at the level of their coasts.
"In case of a Havarie we close the gas throughput in less than one minute," Jens Müller specified.
Thus, in the case of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the constructors to be not very likely, as the pig-weeds were estimated to be resistant to a leak per 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot controlled for external observation purposes from a seaship, as well as by a device circulated inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, which is about one meter in diameter, is introduced into the inside of the pipeline and moved forward through the gas pressure.
After three full days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides accurate information about any deformation of the metal upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without having to be subjected to only the least repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have united their forces to achieve this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are associated (depending on 15.5%), as are the Dutch Gas Union and the French company group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have formed a company community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has then rented the entire capacity of its gas transport, on extendable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the reell transporter gas quantity is", stated Jens Müller.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was secured by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
Total labour costs should amount to EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For example, the investment amount for GDF Suez was 240 million.
The minority shareholders are, however, well-known to recover their expenses, since Gazprom alone carries the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline occurs on a sandy coastline forested with pines at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas outlets.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the gas coming in before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been delivered with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per per per penetrating hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a trademark note book.
Founded about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine now wants to give the writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent writing candlelight.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the egg shell sides, as aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as it is known today, was written in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided to bring a differentiated design note book to the market at that time.
Maria Zebregondi, a company expert at the time, is responsible for launching the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique called Mole Skin (mould skin), which refers to a cotton bag used, for example, for coatings of upholstery sheets.
This kind of notebook was very much in demand among writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object, which until the 20th century was considered an icon of avant-garde artists," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand responsible at Modo Modo.
Success comes.
Between 2006 and 2010 sales rose by 26% and settled with a sales volume of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook inspires both business people and students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
Today, the small Italian company, which included 12 employees in its beginnings, employs more than 100 employees and has had two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centers and understands how to enforce its identity.
"We have followed the Zeitgeist and his new writing needs, which exist despite the upswing of the e-mails," Maria Zebregondi explained.
This cultural trajectory is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: recently the brand launched an exposition called "Detour (Umweg)" in which architects and artists issued their own notebooks.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, the company also launched a bond with leopard patterns.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural spirit and understood it to diversify his products: bags, schedules, fillers, computer covers... The brand has the entire range of articles.
A success that brings Neider to plan: In autumn 2006, Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, which today's Syntegra Capital, and thus launched a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled people remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today, the "15th week of work for disabled people" begins.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% against 9% total unemployment.
Disheartening?
"No, according to Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which sets out the "week of work for disabled people."
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but was tripled."
"Nichtstotrotz remains enormously much to do."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for disabled people before they get a job.
It is more common for the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a Abitur and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% among disabled people compared with 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to get back to work and which form the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, a association founded in 1992 that helps companies to recruit disabled people.
So much for the actual brakes.
Stay the unuttered, the attitudes that are certain, but are slowly developing.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS Entrepreneurde for the magazine La Cité indicated that the survey managers have "a weak level of knowledge regarding the disabled", which is "overrepresented" by "persons in wheelchairs, psychological or intellectual minors".
The result is that the private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled people, which was defined in a 1987 law.
These last figures, dating from 2008, refer to a 2.6% quota.
"We are now around 3%", reports Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization responsible for initiating contributions from companies that violate this law.
The evidence is that the number of "burdens of paying" establishments has decreased from 59 000 to 46 000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros) as well as the sum of paid amounts between 2007 and 2011.
"The 2005 Act, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on companies," Pierre Blanc explained."
"But this improvement also expresses a true understanding, particularly with the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments employ disabled persons between 20 and 49, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Before they offered the "Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45 h) the foreheads, Eden Hazard and George's Leekens did not hide their pleasures that brought them the game of friendship.
It would be too far to claim that there has been a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator stage of Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had won nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," the native Liller assures.
As for the contrast between his presentation in club and national self, "It is a unity that warrants everything."
"I am in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to get started."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought on Friday evening against Romania regarding the match against France to finally shine".
But without abandoning the note of "rejoicing".
The French national team he fired since the age of 7 years, his victorious campaigns he led between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This inevitably contributes to strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter even more.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he explains.
"We just walked along the road."
"To allow them to play means great happiness!"
Leken's voice was with kindness "stolz" on his side.
"The pride to express a Galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in its capacity as "neighbors" - that France" has once again become a team on a very high level", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European championship, the technician is very likely to see the plane sharing with the Blues (the French national team) ... and towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians get out big," he stressed.
"We are planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You'll notice the game in the upcoming games." The game against France involved.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento, with great optimism, faces the game back against Bosnia (2:00 p.m.) in Lisbon on Tuesday.
When playing, both teams had missed the reality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees itself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao" will qualify for the 2012 European Championship, his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010.
For Portugal, in fact, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to serve an opponent, Bosnia.
In view of the play (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated the game for more than one hour clearly, but the team was unable to press the thing so important a stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, because we have not achieved an outpost."
However, at home, in its brightly radiant Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they are going to pass through a crowd that is as hot as they are at play, even if the game was announced of course as "very scarce", the optimistic but clear Bento said.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are fully convinced that we can win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to join the 2012 European Championship", but the successors of Carlos Queiroz were relative.
The dissension on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to reach and win a goal.
A difference can already be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, since we have not achieved an exit gate," bento regrets.
"We are going to compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese have planned to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "don't give any time to think"."
A good idea, on condition that it is actually implemented this time.
