Food debt in European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation in the euro area is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 eurozone countries, the increase was higher in November than expected – after 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are based on only 3 percent, said Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the Leitzsins, contrary to the American, British, and Canadian central bank. Their discretion would favour the rise in raw material prices and the slight decline in unemployment in the emergence of an inflation spiral.
The ECB is committed to keeping the inflation rate below two percent or at least close to the two-percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is located in the Zwickmühle: inflation has to be "agreed" in order to exclude future needs of action.
At 3.3 percent, inflation in November in Germany reached a 12-year record high; in Spain, the rate rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The reason for the increase in inflation in the euro area was the increase in food and energy prices.
The MATIF white notes rose by 88 percent, and the price for soya beans also reached record height since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in food oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil increased by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1% to 2.5% in 2008, but it is expected to decrease to 1.9% in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3-percent inflation rate, but the average annual rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup is a government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers grew considerably until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the consent for the socialists according to Gallup has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent.
In the case of the party faithful voters, the difference is marked by the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two thirds (71 percent) are in favour of a fifth (20 percent) consent to the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ are, according to the survey, under the parliamentary entrance burden: they come to two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, the general economic mood has deteriorated further - never before was the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "pronounced bad" so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "very bad".
According to more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation once again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth is expected to improve.
A December Gallup survey showed that 71% of the respondents - a historic high - judged the Prime Minister's work to be "only bad as right".
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proportion of supporters for Viktor Orbán represents 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% mistrust of the Fidesz party chief.
One of the indicators of political moods is the number of those who believe that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could also be taken into account without change of government.
According to the unrest last October, 35% were still committed to the government's and the government's head of government, this share today amounts to only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Inquired for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "with certainty" and that another 20% would give up their vote "presumably".
To compare: if Parliament elections took place on this Sunday, only 55 percent would go "with certainty" to the urns, another 15% would think their participation would be "probably". In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% opposed to the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital daily fee.
Dedicated to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty" the proportions of opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would even amount to 81, 84, and 89 percent respectively.
Also the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost one fifth
The Hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade area continued this year the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser Handelsreieck the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of over 1,000 HUF were recorded in all hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets were "galopated" last December, the price of the food markets did not fall dramatically, compared with the previously high, earlier baseline level.
However, it certainly has a deterrent effect on consumers that what they paid for last year is not even available for 10,000 HUFs.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the examined markets.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the same level as the previous year, while prices for Putenbrustfilets, Nuss and Mohn rose considerably.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but there were also 1 kg of bread waxes for 139 forint.
There was no competitive price fall below 200 forint in the product.
Also surprising was the price of a two-liter coca-cola bottle of less than 200 forint, so the drink including a pan cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison Also the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart compared to the Christmas prices by 15 last year, while Tesco and Alsoan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between last year's cheapest shopping cart and the most expensive of today's year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480.00 HUF.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1.206.00 Forint, but the increase in VAT was noticeable at the prices at last Christmas.
This is exactly what happened: apparently the department stores were not able to decide properly what price range they should apply to the individual articles, as the effects of the increase in prices on consumer behaviour were not foreseeable.
(If the dealer fails to plan the rotational speed of a product, he may fall by significant gains in the price range which depends on the traffic intensity.)
The increase in the "Napi" shopping basket in the last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference at the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost by 1,630,00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest, there was a price increase of 1,284,00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a disastrous price increase, the price of daily consumer goods in the hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: in some basic food products, the Statistical Office established a more than 30 percent increase over the period of 12 months.
So in about next to flour also in eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible in the latter case, as the price level of the product that is already expensive in the previous year has increased by hardly more than 10 percent in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they were able to weigh the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported for good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at prices.
It is bought out of all large quantities, durable foods go in pallets over the shop tables.
Wednesday morning morning in all three department stores there were endless snakes at the cassava when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so that many multiples complain about opinion researchers, they cannot even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are used
More than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals that were due to improper treatment with antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in the hospitals, the overburdening of the beds, the overburdening of the staff - all factors that are not particularly acceptable to the control of the infections, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also stored.
In the traumatology department of János Hospital, MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalised after a severe accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured car accident was released from the hospital, but the man had to return with an MRSA infection a little later. Since then, an important operation has not yet been able to be carried out because of the bacterium that is still in the patient’s body.
Until 10 December of this year, infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been registered in the hospitals with certainty, but the dark ziffer is expected to be higher.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the methicillin-exacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about one third of the people in their nose without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as inflammation of the neck, antelope inflammation, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well-healable.
However, if the funds are too high or used improperly, the well-responsive bacteria produce antibiotics resistant to antibiotics, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
In particular, in patients with weakened, or permanently poor immune system, but also in elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria may cause severe infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning, that is Sepsis.
According to János Hospital's medical director, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the hospital's everyday life.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA said there is only where it is not being searched.
Resistance to antibiotics
"Some patients are isolated, the nurse wears rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics required for treatment" - says Tibor Nyulasi.
While the patients are being examined for MRSA during their delivery to the hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling of rare
The majority of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current prevailing conditions and circumstances would be unfavorable for reducing the origin or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and nursing homes, the hospitals should investigate the patients delivered and immediately isolate MRSA infected.
In the Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not as common.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation from the state health insurance fund.
Most cases would therefore not come to light until the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations on the use of antibiotics in human medicine on the part of the European Union, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases in Hungary.
Antibiotics therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological investigations are necessary so that no resistance to the means can arise, but this directive of hospitals is not always respected.
Among the ambulatory or basic patients, microbiological sample withdrawals are even more rare, according to Karolina Böröcz.
It is part of the disinfectant
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transferred from one patient to another by the nurse.
This is why the handwashing or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in the hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patients in the home hospitals.
The rooms are often crowded, the beds close to each other, although from their epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters.
As Karolina Böröcz points out, unfortunately, even in the less well-kept hospitals, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that encourage the development of infections.
Such infections are found to be far less frequent there, or the further spread of the pathogen may be stopped where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting to grips with MRSA infections causes enormous costs to health insurance companies, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its prevention in the government programme, has been maintained.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data demonstrate, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals, one of its priorities.
Death loan police were not drunk
In the case of the car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district with a fatal outcome, the official opinion is now available.
The police chief of the XXII district, who had killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholized nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press officer of the Budapest state attorney's office on Friday after the official opinion was submitted to the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he was taxed.
The former chief of police, with his own passenger car in the XXII district, turned into Kossuth Lajos Street and passed over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked spot.
(Laut StVO, however, is not a mild situation - the handlebar has, even though pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, minor.)
The pedestrian is injured after his delivery to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebar suffered a shock, then returned his functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Procuratorate has launched its investigations into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former chief of police cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
More EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three loan agreements in Budapest on Friday with a total value of EUR 400 million, which is to flow into education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy industry.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund.The loan agreement over EUR 100 million has already been signed before, the current agreement on the use of the EUR 200 million granted.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be allocated to the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided on later in the framework of the extension of the loan contract.
In the field of innovation, the Contracting Parties signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly flow into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
The metro line 4 was also available at the meeting.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of underground financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The interest on loans is EURIBOR, the loan is made available by the EIB with a suspension of 8 years, free of commission.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - Europe as a whole looks closely at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who is still buying the EU's cheapest market, which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is no doubt the most sought after patch for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, along the sea are Albenga, the "gold coast", the "Sun coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are increasingly in demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country is dedicated to attracting investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favourable area of Russians record more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers seductive offers - commercial and office space offer highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfers' paradises, thus attracting tourists in addition to the summer and winter season in the other two seasons.
Therefore, forward-looking investors are already buying in large-scale formats, for example around Bansko.
Analysts say that people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their life course.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are Russian buyers mainly in the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down buy either revitalized properties by 50-100.000 euros, or come down houses by 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility, as well as communication possibilities, are large-scale, but also the proximity to a large city, shops and doctors are crucial for buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday goals of the Germans in December).
The third group comprises businessmen investing with the aim of increasing medium to long-term value.
However, real estate in the capital is becoming more expensive, due to the growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been an increase of 21 percent per year.
The increase in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries advise on Bali’s Roadmap, which sets out the emission-reducing measures for the post-2012 period, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol has expired.
At present, a heated debate is underway between industrialized and developing countries.
The US has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate on specific figures, but it would be prepared to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the industrialized countries are prepared to support developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on the support of developing countries has also been reached.
The adjustment fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, probably at the UN Global Environmental Facility (GEF), as read in the "Piac és profit".
Hungary 6 percent
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its pioneering role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured at 1990 values), regardless of whether the "convention after 2012" would be achieved or not. The Union would even be willing to use itself for a 30 percent reduction, provided that other major industrialised countries in the world or developing countries are also willing to meet their obligations by force and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU had already committed itself to a 8% reduction in the number of member states at that time.
The standard for Hungary is 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will fully meet as read in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The use is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would only come into force after 2012. In this case, the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a renewed international emission reduction system, the importance of which was highlighted by the IPCC, the UN's scientific climate change committee, the international Nobel Peace Prize, in its recent report.
This would delay emission reduction, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C would inevitably result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
British Army casts on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special Units stationed in Afghanistan since March 2006 load videos about the Taliban-led operations on the network, reports the BBC.
The mini-camera shots mounted on helmets are controlled at Kandahar Air Force Base and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political Message Inescapable
Soldiers of the Luftwaffe have already contributed 139 such shots, their "channel" was seen more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under "defenceheadquaters" in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the Luftwaffe has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the public about the actual objectives of foreign operations.
This kind of published propaganda is almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertising, says defence expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message in themselves, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise game
But the army also has to fight against amateur recordings, which create it in addition to carefully processed, censored recordings - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are at most discussed, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, numerous videos have already been loaded on the platform from the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, but this "gattung" has only recently been discovered by the British.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less life-like simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour Monthika Lamperth is by no means painful: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organizes a work conference in which her employees can let out the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others enchant Christmas mood with tombola or instigation into the officials' hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffets - so celebrates power.
The Christmas fever has already recorded the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held this year in the defense resort, but the employees of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Weihnachtsfeier der orphans" children are given by fallen soldiers, at the "Missionsfeier" family members of soldiers currently stationed abroad are hosted, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport beat the strands.
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is held in the house of the future, approximately 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a tombola ransom.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the State Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The hall rent was 1 million forint, the rest was spent for the more than 400 guests loaded.
According to our information, a section of the NFÜ is also invited at another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt did not confirm this information, because we did not reach those responsible.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, who held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
On request of [origo] one informed: there was no ball dress or suit obligation on the ball.
The ministries of health, work, and self-government prepare themselves for puritarian celebrations.
The Ministry of Health organises the celebration for employees in their own four walls for about 400,000 forint.
Minister of Labour Monthika Lamperth officially does not invite her employees to a Christmas celebration, but to the annual meeting.
It is calculated with about 180 guests who, according to the press department, are only hosted with coffee and pogatche, so the celebration is with 350,000 forint.
With his colleagues, self-government minister Gordon Bajnai will just come across the Aula of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas celebration in its own festival hall where 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured with 2,500 forint per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent incentive.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the PM employees have celebrated each year in this way.
However, there will not be a proper party vote - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites a New Year's reception on the 20th of January, the Christmas celebration of the Ministry falls this time.
One hundred guests are asked to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the Városliget City Park; according to the information of the resort, the spending is estimated at 1,000 Forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it becomes a very simple reception to which foreign diplomats accredited only in Hungary are loaded.
The receptions organised every year traditionally begin with a short speech by the Minister and sound with a reluctance.
As the respective press offices report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration either at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or at the Ministry of Education.
Asking about the cost of the Christmas celebration could not be given information at the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any event, more than 400 guests were invited to celebrate at the Kunstbewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilised for giant streams
The League Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation shall form their coordination committee on Friday for the strike which begins on Monday without a certain duration.
On Saturday a protest majority meeting will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the job deposit will begin.
It is expected that strike-related, significant traffic barriers, as railway traffic is almost completely discontinued, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) will continue to line up until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOS strike Committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday a large protest assembly will be held, and from Monday all organizations that have joined the strike will lay down the work for an indefinite period of time, provided that no agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike beginning on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act has not been defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss further action.
On the basis of the National Council's agenda on Monday, it is even possible that the vote on the Health Insurance Act will only take place in the later hours of the evening, or even at midnight.
The strikes beginning on Monday will require significant traffic barriers: the railways lay down their work for an indefinite period of time, the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies are still in existence in the morning.
At the same time, there will be a roadblocking of a direction in many places.
The call for strike has followed numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is updated on the league website.
Some organizations have announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, others are planning a temporary job placement.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was still no agreement between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the railways VDSZSZ on sufficient services, although more and more people are on the way by train just around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV runs from business start until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy lay down the work for four hours, and the teacher trade union, for example, the Democratic Teachers' Union has called for 2 or 2-8 hourly strikes.
The Hungarian Physician Association of Physicians strangles alternatively at different times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points requested by the League is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and provides a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model which will be due from the next year.
The claim number three is that the eligible professional groups will be able to access the early pension scheme before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZ belonging to the League has not accepted the offer provided by the Ministry of Transport and now calls for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Department for Risk Analysis (Risk Analysis Division) of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August, with the support of the "movement for a Better Hungary", have raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
Among other things, the Institute's "risk warning" report states: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "improvement of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsies and non-Zypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the Hungarian Guard's strategy, which is probably aimed at provocation of such a conflict, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure by the politically responsible: "People of public life have left the discussion of Roma questions to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary approach".
It is believed that this would increase the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "have caused considerable damage to Hungary's image abroad, especially as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember that since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has been constantly on the rise, so that several organisations called "national self-defense association" have been established since summer 2007.
"These groups are inconceivable that they define themselves as civil organization, while they openly boast of preparing their members - sometimes armed - defence tasks (disaster protection, national defence, order protection) under appeal to the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself," it was called.
And further: All of this was done according to that method, which attempts to put various, based on the political and party dissuasiveness of the population, political aspirations as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis of the civil character and the form of the association thus do not merely serve to circumvent legal obstacles that might arise during registration at court - it is also a political strategy.
As the analysis shows, the activities of the Hungarian Guard also constitute a risk-enhancing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring states, according to some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries, in the development of the Hungarian Guard, the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region."
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk to the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the right-wing extreme Bulgarian National Union (GNU).
In the background of the creation of the Bulgarian Guard, the Roma mass escalations were held in a district of Sofia (Kranna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents in the same way as the reason for the establishment of the National Guard, with the argument that the objective of the organisation of "national protection" is.
In her opinion, in the last 17 years, a regular "gypsy terrorism" has been felt in Bulgaria, but the state remained indifferent and indifference - according to Political Capital.
And further, the initiative would have begun a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to establish their own guard for resistance purposes.
As the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not to be excluded that Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protection, says the Political Capital risk warning report.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: Risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
Each year risk analysis reports would be published and risk changing trends should be recognizable, public opinion is informed as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere Holidays
In Hungary, holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of re-disposing working days around the holidays has now been established, but the coming year provides us with less days.
Even in the EU and America, something else is understood as "Feiertag".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and non-working days.
Work-free days are mostly church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old, and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the latter alone can rest with the New Year's New Year's fans.
All year round we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are March 15th, which reminds of the Revolution of 1848, and October 23rd, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, the foundation of the state will be celebrated on May 1st, and on November 1st and 2nd, we will remember our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each for Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "workday shift" has proved itself in the cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on Saturdays, or go to school.
If this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally due to be completed, the Minister of Labour has for many years been defined in his own regulation.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, to public employees and public service officials.
Excluding are only companies and facilities in which the operation is carried on without interruption, i.e. also on holidays.
This year, the working order is brought together only through the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24th, life in this country remains formal, as most of them spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve time compensation, or take the holiday specially lifted for that purpose.
Next year, more holidays fall to the middle of the week, or to the end of the week, so that there will be less redundancies during working days than this year.
The calendar will first be "set on the head" around the day of work so that people can stay at home for the same four days.
Saturday, 26 April will be a working day, so Friday, 2 May can be a rest day.
The second re-disposition is related to the holiday on October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, you will have to finish the Friday, October 24th.
The end of the year will, however, be a restless sign of the holidays after everything is left and will remain, even if New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
Six dissuasive minors to make workmates angry
Emails that we forget to send off, language news that we never receive - harmless lies that don't even notice us anymore: they bring "color" into everyday life at work.
The only question is whether one is accustomed to these small inconveniences, or one is better faced with the challenge and tries to avoid these misunderstandings consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department" - says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best one regrets it and tries to make it up again, perhaps calling at the marketing department and standing up with reluctance, one would have forgotten to send out the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the matter has been dealt with with with with an excuse.
Before you get into embarrassing excuses, you should consider how you can really prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Borrowing something that doesn't belong to one of your own?
There is hardly anything more nervous than getting a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday, the booker was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost believed ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without any question, we should not borrow anything from colleagues, for they are rightly angry when they find that something has come away.
So, don't put any envelopes or post-it out of the office in your pocket, because it could happen to you: no more if you really need it.
The private life of the colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a tratsch that has already been put into the world.
Who did it to who?
Where and why?
Information (or conjectures) on the private life of colleagues should not, if possible, bind everyone to the nose!
And if anyone opens up and tells us his innermost secret, we should not abuse that trust!
The best thing to do is to hide like a grave, rather than target those who are not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Not reported for a reason?
If you call in the office to report yourself sickly to agonizing headaches because you just feel uncomfortable or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, incessant actions, projects with fixed dates, now the colleagues have to do instead of yourself.
So don't play with your colleagues badly!
If you know the day before, that you won't be able to go to the office the next day, or that something could get in between, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time, so that neither the co-workers nor the boss is unexpectedly confronted with absence.
Total, Geckles, Telephoneing
You've just been deepened in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud geeks of the ladies?
I don't want to hear a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
The colleagues should not be nervous with summaries, singing, talking loud (which one leads across their heads), glancing, constantly shrinking or nodling.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not deeply involved in a task (write, plan, organize).
Are the other ones always in debt?
If a project is not completed on time, one has forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, one should not seek the guilt of one's own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk to the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
Best of all, you agree with his mistakes, and excuse yourself, if others were affected too!
The question of how to correct the error again, or how to recover the failure is only too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling at home?
Training hypothesis and slugs: Comfortable for home but has lost nothing in the office!
Not even then should one dress so armyly if the workplace would actually allow it!
Not just too sloppy - one should respect both his colleagues and himself to the extent that you dress in the office accordingly - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
It all wants to do right - or how to make other uninteresting
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
From the radio sounds a strange melody: the sound of a violin paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume up.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's Zagar's song "Wings of Love" that sounds like mr2.
The local music scene has not spoiled us for a long time with qualitative electropop.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you hear Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the local digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock is "in" with its guitar quitsche again, the local electropop proves: There are new ones under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, even playing in the band Yonderboi before - perhaps because a host house does not have two pipes - he began to walk his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, the elements from jazz, electronic, and pop melted, but only when one had approached him with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török.
The formation, which was initially performed in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" ran its first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and named Zagar, together with Yonderboi, as the only trend seter that can be used in the West.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in wearing this brand.
The band responded as it should: With a new, even better album.
The new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new ways to them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Baláz's Zságer was still on the move with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be fine, but besides the essential character of the music, the louder guitar - the spirit of the time and the trends - is the influence of the rock'n'roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti who is living in England and working with the band "The Puzzle" presented himself at the premiere in Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it a radio hit – the band's song "Wings of Love" from early to late pop music, which has been recorded by six local singers ("underground divas"), has successfully set the earworm.
So everything's all right (?).
The hvg.hu asked at Baláz's Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent does your music remain reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "shut music" does not mean a lot to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative or underground music can be visible and unsavory, but they can only be produced for the sale that makes it a commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The audience's willingness to accept this principle also works independently of languages and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B.Zs.: In foreign countries, especially western of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentively because they also think they are part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where do many hear your music?
B.Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling to see that more and more of our concerts are coming.
But we have never composed for the market.
With us, the music does not arise in order to serve a purpose, but for a particular reason.
The role of the audience is most evident in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but in turn there is only in the immaturable changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, one thing happened to me: If you want to do it right for everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career in the West.
For example, Zs.: We don't really go his way, just apart from the fact that you try to interpret this again and again in our music.
We see ourselves as a team player who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At the beginning, of course, comparisons of our work with those of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: "Wings of Love" is the first place in the charts of mr2 Pet.fi.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening consciously staged with a slightly more popular style in the direction of a wider audience?
B.Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which should then be used as a draw horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought of as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to resolve the sound orgy and the slightly more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why just her, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of compiling the choir from gifted soloists of the local music scene.
Thus the six-member choir was created - thus Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik, Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized in the apologizing "underground divas".
hvg.hu: Would you like to have the song the same way, or did the girls co-design it?
For example, Zs.: The number had been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material was finished for the album, we thought that this number still "needs something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a singing voice.
I sang the melody that night, and later they learned the girls.
Everything came practically on its way and frighteningly spontaneous.
I can remember, I was quite electrified at the time, but it was already in need of the "Divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert one had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (except for the short solo of Judy Jay), they do not have their own role, sing completely together and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also on stage in the back.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they stood in the back was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to let them get solo roles.
In the number it is also about forgetting his ego a little, forgetting who came from where and where we are going, let us simply allow ourselves to lift up these particular wings, the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song came into existence.
hvg.hu: Which was the most elaborate song?
For example, Zs.: There has been more difficult tasks in musical work.
For example, at Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove would no longer work, but every now and then everything has joined together as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite song from the new album?
B.Zs.: This is changing with the concerts and also now, where I had the album "loose".
It is currently "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Deprived brokers risked billions due to feelings of inferiority
Groundless cheater
This is how his former employee Jerome Kermiel describes the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
It came about by almost five billion euros.
It seems, however, that Ker much was just a big player who wanted to do it the same way to his colleagues, and certainly wasn't in a position to do it.
In contrast to all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He is rather mentally weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors who showed him to the police.
However, according to the statements made by Kerfiel, which the French media, for example the daily Le Monde, published, he was a person who achieved profits of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year with his business.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros, especially in the American crisis.
He had already looked at the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February there were already initial messages that so-called sub-prime mortgages, as they would be given low-income customers or those who had previously had settlement problems, would be in trouble.
But influence on the whole economy should not have this crisis.
Some people didn't believe that and kept justice.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profits to 1.6 billion euros.
"As soon as I earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain that," he admits and continues to say that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he has falsified documents, so that they will not get him on the ugly side.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though he gradually became interested in his business.
Risk profit
Did he fear to fly?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
How did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at Lyon University.
==References====External links==
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others would.
"When I first spoke in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Ker much explained to the investigators.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the Allianz shares he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros in the London bombings on price losses of this title.
And that was the trigger -- now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, let's leave you
"That's like a snowball," he told the policeman.
But the chiefs supposedly knew about everything or knew it.
"As long as I earned money, they closed their eyes."
But then came the great blow at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost one billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to balance it out.
When he got to work on Monday, he wasn't an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros on its own.
And how did they get to him?
Suspected he made himself through a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to see him in the cards," Ker said much concluding.
Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will enable the Czech Republic to reach 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
It is about half the sum that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into traffic expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will hold over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme aims to help entrepreneurs and companies to gain funds to innovative enterprises.
The aim is to attract finance for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful among the new acceding countries in the money acquisition from EU funds so far.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20 years imprisonment for ex-Presidents
A court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, who was sentenced to 100 million dollars in 2003 for financial fraud (near 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
According to the news agency AP, the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is currently unclear.
According to Ileana Pérez, the chairman of the Appellate Court, it will now depend on the detainees whether they let Alemán down his sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
A court stated four years ago that Alemán had regularly shifted money from the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually landed in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this household?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and which has been adopted without support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The current year was approved with the support of ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented him, and the ČSSD could not allow it to reject him.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Deputies approved this traditional, but highly significant law at ease.
It's paradoxical.
It all begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is covered by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they devote more attention to him.
A argument among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
The state budgets were below three weaknesses in the past social democratic governments, which the 2008 budget cannot at once eliminate:
The first is the high share of expenditure committed by law, which is not just pensions, but also social expenditure, which has decided the "stilling" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists) last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit policy as a result of the first weak point.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is publicly and somewhat under control.
A true time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many mayors, apart from income from taxes, taxes and bank loans, often gave up uncontested debt securities that they over-indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts through massive sales of shares of the energy and other supply networks they have received on the government's privatisation train.
Now this source is already available.
As far as we are concerned only with official and verifiable facts, we note that:
our economy has been growing for some years, such as the rest of the world, and the ČSSD has become famous without neglect.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments blamed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more reasonably than our Republic.
This is a huge disgrace, mainly attributable to the former governments.
We are among the countries which, seen on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have been superfluously blown up to a huge extent in recent years.
Although it has been possible to delete part of the absurd populist expenditure adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is not a shift in retirement age and a pension reform in the near future, practically any policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, nothing will remain as pure management for him.
It is only easy to exaggerate when one says that then, out of ruling politicians, officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure through compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns planned for 2008 would be superfluous if earlier governments had not spent over the past ten years, which was only going on.
If we do not want it to really come about that from ruling politicians will become pure administrative officials, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware of the fact that the state can spend only as much as it is able to take on taxes and fees in order to want peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these will allow for gradual enforcement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to cope with crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
In this way, more than 100 billion dollars of auctions will reach the currency markets by means of auctions.
On these auctions, banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to borrow each other’s money.
For example, the American Fed sends $40 billion to auction, another 24 makes it loose for the European and Swiss central bank.
It is the first time that the central banks of the Member States have agreed on such a coordinated approach to the defence or the mitigating of the consequences of a financial crisis, following the attacks of 11 September.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing shortage of freely available capital that banks can provide," wrote a report for its customers Bernard Baumohl from the consulting company Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost around $60 billion because of unserviced loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more billion more losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what else can do when they decided to do so," said ABN Amro's chief economist, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks have the fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will be more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession, possibly with effects on economic growth around the world.
The central banks decided to do so after they had failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank rate used for renting money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid of borrowing each other's money, and that even though the central banks of the USA, Canada and the UK had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as another reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of the central banks contributes to the warming up of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are unacceptable
Global climate change is said to harm developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now refers to the UN's final international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, No Green Planet", he stated that the discussions of ecologists were unreliable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which represents a strange mix of government representatives and those of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric they accompany and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word fireworks, which is only replacement for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed in the presentation of his book that his subject was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book was published in German translation because "I often encounter caricatures of my views."
So now, interested people could read his attitude without disturbance.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climate scientist, but he felt that he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he is academic, able to understand and assess technical treatises, has experience with statistics and is also economic.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that climate change is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent opinion among the scientists to warming that the consequences of current changes are not too large and therefore serious and are not a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, he considers it as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems to impose unacceptable, other unproved views, he sees this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions raised by the present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who take no account of the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus spoke about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to exchange their driving license
600000 drivers failed to exchange their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where you can apply for the exchange to allow the authorities to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
The Ministry, however, does not fear that after New Year, hundreds of thousands of riders will be on the streets without a valid driving permit.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive any more have not exchanged their driving licence.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in the exchange of letters, the offices of the capital are overburdened with requests, and the interest in the exchange was still growing this week.
The city administration manufactures around 2000 customers a day.
You've got to get up for about half an hour.
In Prague about 140000 drivers have not changed their driving license yet.
The exhibition a new driver's license takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Car drivers who do not create the prescribed exchange by the end of the year and who do not have a valid driving licence will be threatened with a fine from January onwards.
The perpetrator pays a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police can also let it be used with a reminder in the event of wrongdoing.
In the event of a violation, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the one who does not drive at all can receive a punishment from the community.
He could, it was said, threaten a punishment of even 30000 crowns.
The ministry already called on the offices to act mildly and, at most, to impose a penalty of 1,000 crowns.
According to Karel Hanzelka, the official of the Ministry of Transport, no one threatens a thousand crown sentence.
The driving licence is a document in which everyone can decide whether or not to own it.
It is not about a identity card that everyone, a valid one, must have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driving license.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent community office or to send him there by registered letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993.
However, drivers must gradually also exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to change.
The validity of driving licences issued from 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million additional driving licences.
Court cuts penalties for detectives who were allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko'ařík, who are accused of sharing with the gangs of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years of imprisonment.
This was decided in a legal judgment by the Prague Supreme Court, which reduced its sentence by one or two years.
Originally the detectives of the "Amt for the fight against organized crime" threatened 14 or 12 years.
There is no appeal against today's judgment, only revision is possible at the Supreme Court.
Berdych himself is also accused in this matter, but first of all the judgment is before him.
In other trials, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
He cannot be condemned anymore.
A district court in January spoke to 19 people mainly because of participation in robbery; today the Oberlandesgericht negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most defendants argued from the outset that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police in consultation, among other things, provided information from sources of the police with Berdych criminals, covered various robberys and helped members of the gang to avoid prosecution.
The band left Opava and Ko'ařík 30 percent of the prey for it.
The charge concerns crimes of the gangs from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robbery, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also for the presumption of office and illicit possession of arms.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel cores, laser remote tube and machine gun.
According to the charges, their robbery has enriched itself by many millions of crowns.
In addition to 20 men in this trial, Berdych and a number of others were legally recognized for other robberys than guilty.
Other men from Berdych's circle have to take responsibility for another process; other cases have not yet been brought to court.
The main proceedings have so far been tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in prison in Ireland and who are waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Exchanged children - invoice: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity hospital, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, from the hospital in Třebíč wants to require 12 million crowns compensation plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million each, for the fathers two million each, and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is therefore totally in agreement with the proposal by Velebas.
"We reject such a proposal, it is often too high," said Dostál after today's negotiations.
"But in order to be able to give us an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that had the opposite side created.
We'll find out if it's even true.
However, we insist that this should be for all together in the hundred-thousand-thousands area," said Dostál.
According to him, the amount should move between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jablo'ov wanted a million crowns for each month, which she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, as a basis for compensation negotiations, a report was prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children suffered mental damage and stress symptoms in different strength and depth, according to experts from the field of psychology and psychiatry.
The men placed the stress situation better, even if they saw accusations against them, they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
In turn, the women cope with the aftereffects of the experienced trauma, as well as with what is happening right now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the Liaison Hospital in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablo.
At the end of October each family gave up 100000 crowns as replacements for expenses resulting from the fault of the hospital in Třebíč, which is under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law for liability.
In case of doubt, they must take the form of a reserve fund, only in exceptional cases can they apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far committed relatively low damages, the amounts determined by tables and moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, except millions.
Polívka came around his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the battle over the brand "Kingdom Walachei".
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he first used the term "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in many years of work.
Polívka did not take part in the negotiations today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over and his client will probably make appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabiš and his team wanting to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas parasitic," said after the trial of Polívka's lawyer.
Everyone introduced themselves to the words "Walachian Kingdom" just this actor and comedian.
The same opinion is also given by Harabiš.
"We have an almost ten-year job behind us.
He said that it was the acquisition of money and concepts of activities.
According to him, the reason is a fight for money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could also have something of it.
They want to win our work parasiticly," he continued.
Lukrative Business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television programs.
In 1993 Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
At the time, however, this did not coincide with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came to the mind of spending whale passports.
From an initial fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity were crystallized, to which Harabiš then joined the establishment of the "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered to its owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre presentations.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also claimed today that Harabiš only used the mere idea that Polívka made public in the "Manege" mission for his entrepreneurial purposes.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Welsh Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabiš project and his team had devoted themselves to him intensively.
The cooperation of today's disputed parties lasted until the year 2000, when Harabiš organized official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, Polívka and Harabiš had begun to accumulate the disputes that sprang up in the suspension of "König Boleslav's I. elected to the Sankt-Nimmerleins-Tag".
The leading role was then used as a queen mother by Harabiš Jarmila Šuláková.
In 2002, Polívka filed an appeal against Harabiš and his company, which dismissed the court today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the race prepared by Harabiš to the throne and half a princess.
This should lead to a new king.
He did not want to betray details and an appointment yet.
"We don't want to get over anything.
It should be something like the royal move in the Walachei.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also register quietly," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Dwindle foresight
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear circuit, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather under-average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that is much better.
The combination with the name SW is still a bit further, and I just keep revising my opinion.
When I tested the classic Hatchback of 207, for example, I had to complain about the too little head freedom on the back seats.
These complaints are no longer available, because the combination's bodywork is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Quick Keep On
I'm just going through the interior just a short while to not repeat myself too much.
It is a fairly successful design, where I have objections only because of the dire middle tunnel.
I would like to welcome a little more designer design where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times where we may be complaining about too short seats or headrests.
The side stand has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As for the room offer, you can also feel the increased dimensions of the bodywork.
In combination, the lack of head freedom mentioned above has also been eliminated.
Sacrifice in the Sacrifice
The main thing about this car is the loading room.
I have to call it (also because of the folding back window) very well and save space.
The hollow rooms are equipped with restraints that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, let themselves be pulled apart, and they also hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the peugeot remains by clearly noticeable 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a stay abroad or when loading a stroller.
But in order to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat loading room or the very low loading edge after folding the rear seats.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with engine capacity of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kWp.
And honestly, a 1600-cubic motor should look like a family-hitchback.
He's quiet, has a low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart to Škoda, who sometimes looks like his exhaust is stuffed with a patch, then I can only be enthusiastic about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not popular.
But we must remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine of 329900 crowns is still up.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is quite a lot.
The equipment Premium of the test car beats again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc wiper solution, electric windows rear and...
Thus the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but you'll figure out the additional equipment of a Fabia and you'll arrive at a very similar sum.
So only the choice of which brand one wants to choose remains.
Integration of Slovak students into British schools does not succeed
At British schools, the number of children from Eastern Europe is increasing, causing local fears about the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far faced a number of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where disputes between the immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment and robbery among students have transferred to relations between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended themselves by the boy's insulting her with racist abuses.
The police also had to intervene after an attack by two minor girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had supposedly made racist remarks to the man and rejected him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bushy and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw on us apples and pears, and then exposed his buttocks," a mother of Slovak students from The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the conflict with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
The mentioned cases testify that the mood between locals and immigrants at British schools is becoming more and more tense.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks came here looking for work.
Some 30000 Slovak students are therefore attending British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, that will be fulfilled if you only choose the right thing.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters who offer pizza, ice cream and charming cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, Golf and Roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
But only on an island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American epoch.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was one of the chiefs of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the USA (especially during the Prohibition), was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high-rises grew, and cars drove across the wide boulevards, which were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of Havana's Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar in the hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as you wish.
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana until today, because the once imported shiguli and fiats have already fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
May Havana, in particular his oldest part, have come down strongly, nowhere can you find as many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are just being drained out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the urgent need for money for tourism, there was green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have not only emerged in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another marotte that is unique in the world and attracts especially railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow tracks to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, so you can see clean and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have been in the museum for a long time.
Aims
The most important places do not exclude the majority of the visitors of Cuba.
So you don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
Stays to mention that in the already mentioned property Hemingways there is a museum whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, steeply rising from the valley floor, collected fertile soil in their cavities, through which even weathered rock areas are covered by dense growth.
This valley is where the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was shot there.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Fame and riches brought her trade with slaves and sugar.
The richness was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road there in the fifties of the last century that the area had connected with the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it remained unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing destroyed either, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon for Trinidad, then it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "tal of sugar factories".
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, which is alive after the darkness, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba is known by some as the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the path to it.
Both roads, which lead from Guantánamo, have to overcome high and clumsy mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human interventions.
These eastern suburbs of Cuba included UNESCO in their world heritage, thanks to its unspoiled nature.
There is the best chocolate produced, in the church one shows the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, there are several Table Mountains, of which El Yunque is the best known.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the pig bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, you could write many pages.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Ally in Afghanistan are passive, say Americans.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment are said to affect the United States the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should design a concrete plan for the coming years, according to the words of Minister of Defense Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan is not in line with its ideas, but in Scottish Edinburgh the representatives of the countries agreed that units were stationed in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance of Taliban sides, the eight participating states also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Minister of Defense Robert Gates, called NATO units to increase activity, Great Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of Afghan government and in strengthening development aid.
"In Afghanistan forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
A further part is to enable residents to start their own economic and security development," says British Defense Minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activities of Afghan insurgents have reached the highest level for five years, according to the U.S. Army.
The number of violence actions rose by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand by even sixty percent.
NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached an absolute limit on the organisation and equipment of the units.
In concrete terms, they call for further helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," said Gates.
The Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, spoke similarly today.
"I'm not happy about what we have in Afghanistan to land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of Reuters Agency to conclude three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries involved, there is also a dispute over whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best in recent months.
For example, Germany was criticised for passiveity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the struggle requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," said Gates.
The British boulevard newspaper "Sun" called the German soldiers a faulage this week.
"Afghanic non-sture degenerates: The Germans are playing games while our boys are fighting," wrote the "Sun" in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German image magazine went on to counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt will be reduced to a trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a public debt of 84000 crowns.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to owe itself to 159.2 billion cans this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of government fiscal policy.
The Czech Republic's government debt increased to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have sank by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its data on government debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has a debt of 84000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"Even now it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the limit of a trillion crown until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and a trillion crown," said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance, said: "We could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget we do not yet know.
If it is to show that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I'm not going out of such a change," he remarked.
Debt growth
The public debt is due to the debt of the state government and is mainly due to the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
Government debt is financed by financial statements, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, bonds from the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt now rose to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The state's external debt has now increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and has been falling by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
"The overall debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much in view of how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting to note that growth is mainly due to the debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The funding strategy and the handling of government debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to take up 159.2 billion crowns for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the better development of government fiscal policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government deficit, which this year will obviously reach 76 billion crowns instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum of planned funds for the consolidation agency amounting to 13.3 billion crowns, a ten-billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billions, and the lending to the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher who had been accused in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum and subsequently dismissed.
The British woman was accused of having six to seven-year-old students allowed to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She deserved to get pissed out.
After several complaints from students at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary schoolteacher working at the Unity High School of Khartoum was picked up at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter takes its beginning in September when the teacher asks her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Muhammad, reports head of school Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 of 23 children choose Muhammad as the favorite first names.
Certainly, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Muhammad .
The bear itself did not carry a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew them well, and she would never have done anything she could approach religious faith, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, his belief is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by numerous teachers who describe it as very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks of religion in class.
Remember that the first name Muhammad is also the second most common second name in Britain, for which 14 different writings exist in English.
This often chosen first name by Muslim families is considered to be a kind of tribute to the prophets (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But how do the rules on the use of this first name speak?
For example, could you give him a toy?
This, of course, is a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, there was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion session on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach agreement on the status, said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace is at stake in the region, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina urged them to meet their commitments to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The agents of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the USA and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of 90% of the Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council until December 10.
The discussions of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika had received the mandate of the UN last August for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mandate to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the approval of Kosovo's independence at the Security Council, insist on continuing the negotiations beyond that end date.
Russia was and remains a spokesperson of a negotiated solution, a consensual solution, said Botswana-Khartchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After being under UN administration for eight years, the Western countries consider independence to be the only solution with future control by the EU.
Pristina is ready to announce this unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide for its benefit.
Belgrade insists on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Cosovarian rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province shared his regrets.
However, he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade was part of the autonomy of a past that led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
On the other hand, Serbian President Boris Tradic felt that compromise should always be desired and warned the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia this does not mean that compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision would be taken only on its own in the Security Council, where their Russian allies had a veto right.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only one decision from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end up the way they started: in the Security Council.
The journalists answered Fatmir Sejdiu that the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status and added that any one-sided declaration of independence will be carried out by the Albanian-speaking people in coordination with the Western countries.
Bush opens an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had gathered in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He stated that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them reach a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must destroy terrorist infrastructures and Israel must cease colonization, Bush explained, reminding the two parties of their obligations in relation to the road map for peace that they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas at the end of the day are seeking a peace treaty that will clarify all open questions without exception, including the central issues.
This term covers the three serious problems that the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians are mainly turning: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the present state of Israel as a result of the 1948 conflict.
After the American president, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the negotiations to be concluded are conducted in a comprehensive and thorough manner and provide a regulation for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor in his turn, he committed himself to conducting the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations directly and without interruption and to making efforts to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of its vision of two states , a Palestinian and an Israeli that exists next to each other for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it received from Bush a guarantee in this sense of Bush before it decided to take part in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a great success for Washington, has led a plan adopted by all Arab countries offering peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the war in 1967, including Eastern Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a split path in the history of the Middle Orient, especially because it is attacking the roots of the conflict and its central aspects, the Saudi Arab Prince in his interview with the Arab daily newspaper financed by Saudi Money.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are opposite.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations carried out by the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IPPN), on Sunday, shortly after 17:00, a police car drove on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on strike, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, a spokesman of the police explained.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without approval, thus not released for public transport (see below), came, driven by two young people without helmet, driven at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car, after disregarding its advance from the right, a police officer continued.
Alcohol control carried out in the vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the car (polluted pedigree, split windshield, broken impact rod) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, already yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she entrusted the IGPN with a communication on the "facts of the involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance for persons in danger", in agreement with the main public security department of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she ruled out the responsibility of the police at this stage of the investigation of the IGPN.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident who were heard Sunday evening confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small-powered bike came to its left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday, a kind of roller, caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had been embroidered until the police managed to brake.
Vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical review.
The body names of the two victims were observed yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the round that the police would have left the accident site very quickly, and that without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very careful, it would also exclude any serious errors concerning it.
According to one police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigations for which further investigations are needed and in which one has to be very careful.
Libération has hit a witness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
He had a direct view of the scene from one of his windows.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revitalize her, this witness says.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed police officer who turned back.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people who telephoned four .
In view of the tension that arose quickly around the events and, as it seems, due to the certainty that the present people had about the unexpected situation of the young, the police were taken in by colleagues who had arrived at the accident site.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also used cardiac massages, but in vain.
I will not allow that is claimed that the police did not help the young people.
They have been given first aid to these young people.
The fire brigade came right away.
Everything was done to try to save her, emphasized the prosecutor.
Pakistan is on the increase in tension
On Monday the Pakistani police have taken down the first demonstrations, since two days earlier General Musharraf had been called out of emergency.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated the measures taken in the context of the emergency had been injured by the tear gas grenades that the regulatory forces put in there.
Those then threw stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been arrested temporarily.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court's attorneys asked for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of oppositionants, defendants of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court had been blocked to prevent the congregation.
Further demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (Mitte) and in Peshawar (Nordosten).
On Monday, the attorney movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president asked the population to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the emergency, and the waste that an oath had placed in front of Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly concerned by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
In the days that followed, he had to make a statement on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, was disbanded and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the Magistrate of the News newspaper stated.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to deliver the commander's order on the army and become a civilian president is no longer valid since the appeal of the emergency, stated on Monday the Deputy Minister for Information Tariq Azema.
It was expected that he would give up his military uniform until November 15, when his first term of office ends as President.
The Deputy Minister for Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government deduced the rumors that President Musharraf would have assigned to his deputy commander a place of residence.
More than one third of pregnancy is still not planned
This calculation takes account of unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the ill-planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes account of unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the ill-planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as pills or spirals still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of age who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of reception prevention has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
At any rate, eight out of ten births are carefully planned today.
In one of five pairs even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to get a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the occupation of the International Space Station (ISS) will have used more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector which is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
A bold exit, which has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools made by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that should soon take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a type of landing bridge for the module laboratory.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17.5-ton module for power generation via solar collectors already on the ISS to put it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew moved to the restructuring of the solar panels of the module, which span 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors that fold up like accordionone was damaged by a clasped cable on a length of about one meter
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who were originally to leave the space shuttle Discovery for a check-out and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30 meter long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was thus selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully assessing the damage, he cut through the faulty cable and attached some kind of rail on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who stayed near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey bat, wrapped with insulator, to prevent the solar collectors producing several hundred volts, an electric blow, the astronauts on board the station had invented and disassembled.
When the action was finished, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully completed before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery to come back to Earth on Wednesday.
The title of EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the aviation and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros in order to counter the residues of the A400M, the EADS share is currently showing a significant drop on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to EUR 21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 once again on the residues caused by the slow progress of the engine of the A400M, which delay the flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October in order to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military aircraft amount to between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion , of which more than one billion for Airbus , announced the parent group of the European manufacturer EADS .
On the basis of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it added without further details.
The Group also notes that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month backlog.
In order to remember that the EADS’ business performance has fallen from 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The Choice of the Status Quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting when the urns are told: the mass of Russians will decide for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very closed election fight, she confirms her quest for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the electorate, which has already been recorded, but whose contents are kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the leading candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml party for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President had nothing to see when he received foreign ambassadors, and was content to provide a new attack against the Western powers accused of interference - his favorite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have put themselves there.
She's in favor of an electoral struggle stained by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, ex-chasing world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days imprisonment for illicit demonstrations, according to his lawyer, continued to be banned from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections, there are two major questions:
Who will take Putin's successor as president?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections, March 2, 2008; the candidates have time to make themselves known until December 23.
Since he was elected in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third mandate in a row.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President-in-Office of the Parliament and the United Kingdom Government, the Government and President will be elected?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, the current power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not master of their destiny, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov from the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further: bourgeois society has only developed very slowly in this country, which was christianized for five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin again joined the model of a paternalist state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more because this new paternalism did not follow terror, but a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman says of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians do not accept the personal responsibility they have given up for a short time after the collapse of the USSR.
Why do you think about it for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all levels of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands it to keep the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional leaders) lead the local election lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equal to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Tamara Tcherednitchenko's conclusion, a 54-year-old professor: Why do you think about it for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad as to trigger them?
A Hard Remembrance
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, who document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed in Bad Arolsen at a total length of 27 km, could not be viewed until now, except with a humanitarian intention, that is, individually and named, on the question of a former victim or his family.
In May 2006, the eleven states - including Germany, France, Israel and the USA - agreed to make them available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
The historians' access to Bad Arolsen will enable them to carry out research, in particular on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the health status of forced labourers, explains Reto Masters, head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public, due to the delicate nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deportation victims.
The members of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been put together for a practical reason after the war: to find civilians who had been deported or forced labour, and to provide them with any evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent workers handle tens of thousands of personal requests in Bad Arolsen.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
Nothing fundamentally new can be expected in these documents, Mr. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, explained in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching the 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's most important trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission green light last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will push the two economic areas forward enormously , and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans , confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most widely exported products by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants exchange goods annually worth 47 billion euros and services worth 10 billion euros, had declared this week Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission's Regulation in New Delhi, and regrets that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. On Friday, the EU and India meet with their eighth diplomatic in New Delhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern about reducing the current recurring concern about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a base rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an unusual duration.
In order to weaken the fears that the conditions in the financial market will be particularly difficult at the end of the year and to give banks a greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions at that time , the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings deposits during the maintenance phase beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks , in a communication.
The Bank further states that this way 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation on 6 December, and only 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that BoE is in circulation in an open-market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it is prepared to take further measures to obtain from day to day different interest rates of interbank loans with their basic interest rate.
From day to day, the different interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has applied to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis of the summer, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with criminal charges which the banks had held back from using them.
According to certain rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank, to benefit from more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill of law on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text produced by a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of PS, most of them 50% on the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIP fleetante, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was disbanded after the main discussion, which gave rise to some violent changes of words between majority and opposition, some hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's TV contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of the finances that had been examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Republic Festival of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no longer and no less, served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones of C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapaloosa Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival will probably take place on August 8-10, on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Melvin Benn Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most renowned festivals.
In 1989 he took over the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added his portfolio to the Leeds Festival, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been working as co-owners for the production of the license concessions and for the organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever attended, says that his company and Melvin Benn are working alongside each other to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We selected Philadelphia as a market and worked diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained in political debates about current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Happy we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has brought the Lollapaloosa Festival to life again in the Grand Park Chicago in 2005, after it was profiled in the festival with Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
In 2007, the two events were able to reach $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax revenues.
These two festivals are held in urban surroundings.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while the unscrupulous are taking place on the urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, while at the same time conveying the impression of a rural festival on the European and an urban in the American way."
Vineland is about half way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes on the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to include a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It's not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no less than the Terminator opposes.
These lock tests are part of the delegation's duties.
A political "heicle mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, advocates Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the Governor?
"You have to be careful because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who think best," he says.
The run at the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the main priority is at the moment.
The Oscars' hunt has begun.
At all the festival on the west coast, although that of Sundance, which of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about to introduce the films from Quebec, evaluate them and make sure that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shakespeare hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Festival this month.
Is the stock market facing an end-year rally? Inconsistencies among the experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks to the annual financial statements on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands on the coming end-year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot create safe forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock market is usually accompanied by positive market developments
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to draw up forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially if tensions to be taken seriously determine the current market situation
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in recent weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the stock exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants. These investments mainly invest in pension funds due to the lack of safe equity funds, which is strongly affected by the upward trend towards profitable assets.
Consequently, according to these experts, the stock market will have a rather lateral price trend, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the US bond interest rate, an uncertainty which is mainly due to the increased crude oil price and the risk of the increase in inflation.
Javier Barrio, Chairman of the Sales Department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a ventured time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish share index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its maximum mark on November 8 of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional grant of the pension funds by that time each year.
Nevertheless, the expert emphasizes that things could develop slightly differently this year, especially because of the final year rally taking place in the second week of December, and therefore right after the bridge day on the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous market assessments are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values which depended on the effects of the US mortgage crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
The analysts agree when selecting the values to drive the Ibex to new maximum levels.
Solana of Intermoney claims that this year are the great values in the series.
Among the value-generating, the expert would count the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha from Bank Inversis assures us that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industry sectors.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACP has been on a pick-up course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same course, says the expert.
With regard to increased consumption during Christmas days, the market will determine the situation in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologies will also achieve positive revenue results, even if they are only represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December showed only two declines in the course.
In late 2003, when the technology sheet was set up, the stock market ran out of its crisis and simultaneously initiated the last real end-year rallies so far.
This year, when the Ibex 35 recovered by 28.17 percentage points, December recorded a price increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth winning year in a row (the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and also an end-year period will show itself.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Mondays to Fridays 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the institute operating under the popular Max brand name, these branches mean a large milestone.
But also for the remaining Spanish institutes, since Popular is the first banking group dares to extend the opening hours of its branches by 20:30h and start on Saturdays from 10h to 20:30h.
The BBVA banking group, which also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet taken a definitive decision.
The Bank's ongoing negotiations with the trade unions seem to aim for an agreement, with 75% of all branches closed on Saturdays and open for it on a weekday afternoon, although not for the client.
Whether other banks join the new initiative that adapts to business opening times will depend on the experience of the Popular Bank.
And that's exactly the intention to follow the popular with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, because of their location, can capture the shopping clientele of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank intends to open up the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new, but changed, opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will reorganise the premises of those branches already located in business areas and at the same time adapt them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The extension of the opening hours is thus linked to a new room design of the branches, which is characterized by a more current, colorful design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring did not require a larger investment, but accompanied by an increased staffing, since a branch no longer needed six but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The branches of Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently heads about 2500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the name of Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants and also show extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of the BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to compete for our customers, Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have agreed to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank personnel.
The Spanish private channel Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time and thus exceeds its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the close of the stock market. The channel he led had increased its value by two times his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: That's exactly what hurt me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they did not fall too deep.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit decreases its previous year's losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company value now reaches 4,488,88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52%), and Vocento is only 13% involved.
The Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, making its market value half by 2.193.46 million.
The market value of other listed communications companies, on the other hand, is increasing; in the case of Sogecable, it is 3.571 million, Prisa (producer of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2.518.53 million and Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that it is two similar companies, says Vasile.
Unquestionably, the question remains, to what extent we can actually operate on the market, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
One week ago, Telecinco announced his plan to increase this year's first TV station with more than 1,000 million gross profits from advertising revenue. Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, assured the group's advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising income by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million in the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock exchange (up to 734,4 million), while net income from the TV business was only able to increase 0.7% (630,4 million ).
The main factor for Telecinco's better stock market performance is seen by the analysts in the high payout ratio, which the company has been able to show until now: in 2006, Alejandro Echevarría's company, led by Alejandro Echevarría, made a 100% dividend distribution.
Vasile, however, assures that after purchasing 33% of the shares of Endemol, with media set as a parent company, the ratio may still vary, even if it is still too early for official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to disbursement at least 50% of the shares, even if we have so far given much more and more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by purchasing 33% of the endmol shares.
According to the analysts, the market currently has certain losses.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced his profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% in 2009 to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and by 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecuritys: relies on its high efficiency return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: measures Telecinco (purchasing) as a result of the multiple incentives and the prosperating market, a better position than Antena 3 (holding).
3.
JPMorgan: recommends that, in view of the similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate), expectations should be reduced in both cases
The Congress is in agreement with the Mifid Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to the parliamentary preparation, which ended its meeting today with the Congress Decision in the Senate on the applications for additional and amendment related to the project, the Government published the provisions resulting from the new law with a view to enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of congress and Senate members, who, in their negotiations and votes, had pursued the goal of setting up the best possible regulation to ensure investor safety and to regulate individual business activities, in order to ensure the overall efficiency of the market.
In addition to the modernisation of financial markets, the MIFID, which redefines the Securities Services Regulation, pursues an improvement in investor protection, the increase in the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables specialised firms as well as natural or legal persons to offer financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the consulting companies which are associated with the investment and mediating companies of securities.
Moreover, it extends the number of financial transaction implementation systems so that the regulated circulation markets are added to the multilateral securities business systems and to the systems for the internationalisation of trading orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to identify the priorities of their corporate profile, the confrontation and the forms of handling risks on the market and to register all operations carried out in order to facilitate their control task.
The Congress's Economic Commission proposed further changes, with the decision that the title-backed debt bond must now be considered as complex financial resources for the investor due to its high risk to the investor, confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the working areas of qualified economists was used; 30 years after the 1977 regulation was adopted which restricted the working areas reserved for economic scientists.
For its part, the Senate defined new positions in the financial sector, such as the economic mediator who works on foreign invoices, does not require authorisation by the CNMV and can offer its services to commercialise products and to generate customers at the same time several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (ICP) rose by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the rate of inflation within the European Union provides the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek to compare the location and quality of US products by publishing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared early by using the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using several other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not existing at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the early identified indicator should only be as a benchmark and therefore should not be in line with the final result announced next 14 December.
Consumer price index (ICP) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and the Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs Pedro Solbes, the increase in the MPI in November was temporary; at the same time, it assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless , in the halls of the congress building , Solbes noted that even if the current figure is not good , Spain's inflation gap to the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years .
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4% , announced the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates revenue of over 42 billion euros over the next three years with Northern Rock
The value of Northern Rock has fallen by more than half, after the Bank had called for emergency credit in mid-September of last year, due to crisis, and by now it now amounts to only 12,000 million pounds (which corresponds to 16.800 million euros).
At that time, the Bank's assets were recordd at 25,000 million pounds, a sum significantly lowered within two and a half months due to the customer's loss of confidence and even despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money would be safe until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which the group would continue after taking over under the brand name Virgin Money, must contribute about a quarter of the income of British banks, which will be composed from the facilities of the next three years, to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their target of 30 billion.
The group of multimillionaires Richard Branson, who is known for his striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to make 50,000 million pounds (approx. approx. 70 million euros) flow annually into advertising and marketing campaigns in order to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, in which three more companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participation in urban corruption
The Spanish police arrested the current mayor of Totano (Partido Popular) in the municipality of Murcia this morning, because of the urgent suspicion of urban corruption that was revealed this week.
In addition, one of the secretarys of the municipal council and the chief of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo last May represented Juan Morales, currently a member of the Partido Popular and at the time Chairman of the Council of Totana, and could be the original wiredriver of the plot according to information provided by the radio station Cadena SER.
Officials continue to search the community and the Ministry of Urban Planning business documents and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer was accused of the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular , and therefore privileged Member Juan Morales was arrested when leaving his client's residence due to important loady documents to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report from the alleged order payments of Morales to a Galic construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban construction contract in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight persons are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the candidate of the PSOE in Toledo and, in case of a election victory, to attend Congress.
Former Minister of Defense José Bono has adopted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. He will therefore list PSOE candidates in the upcoming General Elections in Toledo and, in the event of a election victory of Socialists, take over the office of the Congress President.
For example, José Blanco, Secretary of Organisation of the PSOE, and Bono announced at the press conference, after a meeting with Zapatero was held today in the head office of the party.
The head of government considers that the offer to the former ministers is justified, as it is important in policy to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists, the politician from Mancha would apparently run as chairman of the Congress for the party during the upcoming elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as president of the Congress last 15 November, who had announced that he would no longer join the next General Elections, end his career in public policy, and instead use himself in the university field of climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that the President of the Government had been pressing continuously for his return to political action since his resignation two years ago.
He also pointed out that, as with the appointment of Vice-President of the Economy , the party would not want to prevent citizens from accepting the post of the Congress President in the event of a election victory , and described this as an act of transparency .
If he should actually take office, he hopes to turn the board into a house of respect, not insulting or shredding, in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, one gets the impression from time to time as if the only place in which one cannot speak quietly and quietly in Madrid is the congress, so the president of the government in the Senate was interrupted once up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to appear to have already taken over the office, because otherwise his political opponents would call this an arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate involves both the skeptics of climate change and those who are in the forefront of a social and political debate, the movement as a whole must demonstrate strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement that, as in the case of the President of the Government Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal brings him in need of explanation as to the action or non-treatment of his government, which has contributed decisively to the fact that Spain is at the forefront of the countries that have least met the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are those responsible for the failure to comply with the requirements, which sectors are due to this, and why has not his government, who had proposed the treaty with the planet, stopped this development.
In addition, it is now forced to demonstrate to the Spanish citizens the measures it intends to take against climate change without delay.
What companies will be affected, what behaviour is to be changed, what individual and collective savings measures need to be implemented and what economic consequences result from it.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice and pay for saving the planet.
However, there is and will not be any such explanations in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and paying.
The measures that can be used in real terms against climate change are unpopular.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of businesses and citizens.
Even the petrol centre proposed by the PSOE, Zapatero appeared to be absolutely dangerous in his view that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, so with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, minutes and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise appropriate politicians must neither speak nor accuse nor demand, but instead comply with the demanding edition, decorate the meetings and inspire others with his meekness and goodness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and thus does not provide that the bike will become the only means of movement in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with a compartment.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana, due to a supposed development into urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of Totana, who belongs to Murcia, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. Furthermore, the local police chief, the mayor’s office secretary and a hotel contractor were kept in custody because of the alleged suspicion of urban infringements, today it was out of investigation.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in which he was located until now, surrounded by numerous agents who also had arrived at the municipal administration and at the municipal construction centre Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which revealed that more than 2 million hectares of unexplored construction land should be remodelled for urban construction projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which should build 4000 homes on the property after local administration has granted illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested directly, but were subject to a investigation procedure initiated and executed by the First Court of Totonas.
The first six prisoners have been presented to the judge today.
According to investigation circles, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP member Juan Morales is also identified.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend, who lives in Murcia, is suspected.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the lawyer from Vigo and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pondevedra), as was also the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is to have served as a subgroup of Nuaria and received the compensation.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban offences, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, made eleven more searches, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At this point, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farming industry, which should have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria building group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Murcia, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of land in Totana, which it was allowed to rebuild. The aim was to implement a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25.000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group comprises other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the car parks of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the phrase book of the month and instead try to invent a price label of other names with appropriate competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are cordially invited to make your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the top of the PISA study), which relates to the remark published in the same newspaper on November 18, which happened to be on that day, which contained the criticism of Blackburn's book.
The content of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a Abiturient who quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
In an interview by the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, asked the teachers to take a more critical position with Plato and suggested to delete the doctrine of Plato from the sub-stage curriculum for philosophy at Gymnasia.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a breach of law that would be caught with six months' imprisonment.
But if you take out a music store below a value of 400 euros again, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you take out the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than in the case of a download (Article 234 Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than when downloading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a brawl than in a music data exchange.
To participate in a rebellious dispute, a prison sentence of three to 12 months takes place (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the data exchange results in a six-month period of imprisonment for up to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at the workplace is considered to be less bad than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films whose authorization by the authors has not taken place is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague should have the right, then someone has raised his demands very nicely.

My doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles with the title: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when others get more of it.
So the feelings resulting from the monthly payment depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was prepared with the help of a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last edition of the Science magazine.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research center Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest if the participant gave correct answers and his co-player failed.
The researchers could see that the brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were correct with their answer and thus received the same salary; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it really requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The prosecutor from the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been inexorably close to the criminals of the Balkan Wars. Her office is located in the prosecutor's office of the former Yugoslavian Criminal Court, located in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year, and Carla will leave her office with a crying and a laughing eye, as the chief executives of the Srebrenica massacre - where eight thousand Bosnian Muslims died - the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic are still on their free foot.
Their names are on the list that the Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach, as a template for the title of his documentary film La List de Carla (2006), in Spain; a film that, at the pace of a polit thriller, follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York on her project to track the escaped criminals and put pressure on their respective governments to tighten their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
The car insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost, whose height depends on different factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driver's license, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Having a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even harder to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, you need to be clear what we're dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance company.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract stating that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged, in return, to submit the corresponding sum in the event of a damage.
The insurance premium is the price of insurance composed of several factors, including age, gender, date of creation of the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to statistics, so that higher contributions will also be due in the event of a higher risk of accident.
For this reason, both 25-year-olds and women have to pay fewer contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since according to statistics and thus according to companies, they tend to be less accidents than single persons.
The benefit attached to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus the probability of an accident.
The more frequent use, the more likely the damage.
In the preparation of the premium, insurance companies must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver also needs to study the situation thoroughly to select exactly the car insurance that meets his personal needs most.
We now list the most important points that should be considered when selecting insurance in order not only to be able to make a performance, but also to make a price-oriented choice.
The under 25s find many obstacles in choosing low-priced insurance, such as low driving practice and the young driving licence.
Even if it would be best for ideal insurance protection to complete a full cash insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full cashier with self-interest, so that the benefits of a full cash insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay part of the amount resulting from the damage himself.
The amount is fixed before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium. This is higher than the sum to be paid, says Luis Noguera, Spain's main representative at First Europe, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is the extended insurance, which guarantees the customer against external damage to the accident, but not the damage caused by the car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a council.
When you're under 25 years old, it's in your hand to reduce insurance costs, so your credit is increased by trying to be careful and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate of the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, fines include an increase in said tariffs.
The amount of credit and penalty payments depends on the company's income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can increase the bonus payments, explains Noguera.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that the accident rate decreases with increasing driving practice.
Thus, it is best to opt for a full cash insurance with self-participation.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their past experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish leader of the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been stopped.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who has no children to complete a full cash insurance; of course, only if it allows the financial situation of the respective person.
On the side of the insurers, married couples with children as customers with the lowest accident rate are considered, and accordingly their contribution payments also fall off.
In this case, the best option would be a full cash insurance with self-interest (with an amount of 300 euros). In case you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which will only be used for the third year of vehicle life.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to make a higher contribution payment, says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is possible to complete a full cash insurance with self-interest (in case of an amount of 150 euros) or an extended insurance, which only applies with sufficient credit.
In the end, one must bear in mind that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damage, but also because it entails high costs that require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow is hoping for the eight-final point in Milan
The FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight for the point they lack to achieve their respective goals before the end of the Championsleague round in San Siro next Tuesday. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while they decide on their participation in the Scottish team.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a difference in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow needs another nine points to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not pick up the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of the group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as the FC Milan must compete at the FIFA World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the semifinals for the entry into the finals that will take place on the 16th.
Thus, this group will be completed before everyone else and the dissension at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the expected overall result, even if both teams will try to win, because the Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtic Glasgow knows that they would be in the event of a victory group star and thus have a better starting position in the eight-story final.
The Gordon Strachan team could even defeat the FC Shakhtar to qualify. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points equal to the Ukrainians, although they had lost (2-1) last week in Glasgow, but could win in the second game (2-0).
Hence, the Milan countries will try to avoid the evening. The again hope to achieve for the second time in a row the eight-el finale of the redesigned Championsleague after being defeated in the previous season in exactly the same round by a gate of Kaka in the post-game time (1-0) and by a zero too dissension on the match.
While the FC Shakhtar is waiting for the Rossoneri victory, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both the achievement of the eight-el finale and its membership with the UEFA depend on its victory and defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win third place by winning and thus participate in the UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first concert of Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave the launch shot in Vancouver in front of 20,000 spectators in Canada for their first tour after the band's end in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before their concert in the stadium GM Place de Vancouver that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people were able to experience the concert at the sold-out stadium, where a video on the history of the band, which had taken care of Furore at the end of the 1990s, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, and which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls wore gold bracelets on stage, which the husband of Posh Spice, the English football player David Beckham, had previously given them.
The sportsman was among the fan masses in the audience who made the GM Palace glow, although the nerves of his spouse Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
While the preparations for the shoot let Victoria Beckham say that the British star didn't get our wardrobe on our face a single time, and that's why I'm really excited about what he's going to like about the show.
Sporty Spice , whose exit from the group in 1998 due to internal differences of opinion two years later, expressed her nervousness at a press meeting two hours before the concert.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I didn't really think so, so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm said about the separation of the band she had made nine years ago.
The singer also told us that the disputes were eliminated and that everyone now enjoys them all again.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, according to CTV TV station report, the group arrived in a special engine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
On their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nanny.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will appear next in California, San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on December 23rd.
New fears of natural gas conflict between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is taking place between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports will be affected by fuel exports to Western Europe.
The majority of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will pay higher transit fees from Russia.
An earlier conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent conflict between Kiev and Moscow happens at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be more calculated as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during discussions," said the Minister of Economic Affairs of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the news agency Reuters.
"The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] through Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom reduced deliveries to Ukraine.
This led to a case of exports to Western Europe, which dramatically boosted prices.
Russian gas constitutes a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas supply, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the monitoring of the pre-criminal register for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body outside.
The recommendation came from the main financial controller Robert Black after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in Zummenhang with the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern about the fact that the Scottish state health service does not have any precise ideas regarding the number of foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls on a sample of five health authorities were carried out correctly.
The main financial controller examined personnel recruited outside the European Economic Area countries as a result of the attack at Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transfer in October, and was burdened with the alleged car bomb attack in the UK.
The public health service is expected to carry out checks prior to the appointment of foreign employees in order to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to check for criminal records, the Agency does not have the competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main auditor's report now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Management Board should take guidelines from the criminal register extract, which helps employers to control in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these controls in some personnel documents, they have not been carried out routinely," the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their research guidelines to a large extent prior to employment, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health service workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations would identify potential NHS employees who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that current preliminary tests by NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the board of directors had problems identifying those employees who are on leave for an indefinite period of time.
The investigation continued to establish that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were largely complied with.
These include passports, work permits, and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its NHS policies and guidelines for controls prior to start-up for foreign personnel.
Nicola Sturgeon, Secretary of Health, said: "It was my concern to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on the monitoring examinations would be reflected in advance of the appointment of all employees, including those from abroad, whose publication is scheduled next month.

The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming Indiana Jones's continuation The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud to get the prize that was named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my guy, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells who had planned an upcoming attack on an oil plant as well as on spiritual and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells would have planned to smuggle rockets.
Sympathisers of Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been a ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion into Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned to attack an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35.000-man fast intervention rupture to protect the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006 following a mistaken Al Quaida attack.
The report, with reference to a statement on internal affairs, says that 18 of the arrested were among a cell led by a "Raket expert" who immigrated illegally into the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the prisoners had planned to kill spiritual and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis who are looking for Iraq to join Al Qaida militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the U.S.-assisted Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretic by the Hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaida Milizen considers many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in supporting the policies of the royal family that dominate the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia, targeting the pro-Western Saudi government - have it in addition to foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a very great effort of the security forces over the last... five months," one of the ministers of the Ministry of the Interior informed state television.
The arrests also included a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed at recruiting for "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims that are branded as infiris and abject.
Among the arrested were also 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
Venus may have been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on a orbit show that the planet is more like a turned off twin of the earth than it has previously been aware.
Venus is the most planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but the Venus of the Sun is somewhat closer.
Billions of years ago, on Venus, conditions very similar to those on earth and could even have been inhabitable, scientists believe today.
But due to the unbroken carbon dioxide engine effect, the erosion of the atmosphere due to solar radiation and a slower rotational rate, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is robbed of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the space probe Venus Express of the European Space Agency, which has examined the plants for a year, provide a sobering view of how Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of Venus Express Mission's head, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data enable us to construct a scenario in which Venus started billions of years ago as the Earth, possibly with an inhabitable environment."
"Successed Uranium" seized by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police speaker said that three people were arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (48,000 pounds).
All open.
Mid Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency finally agreed to present a debate on YouTube, record questions in the ordinary voters on video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman, who questioned democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected exactly the state of the Republican Party that broke up in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate that selected the upcoming YouTube clips to be shown.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, which was the longest devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of dissenting voters to use a dial when they heard things they liked: The TV organization noted tips of consent when the candidates spoke strictly about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed forward in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to shake off the reputation that he had been lenient about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of stopping illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two were particularly violently dissociating as a questioner asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegal would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congress member, and Tom Tancredo, a convention member from Colorado, succeeded in doing so.
None of the two men have a serious chance of nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have taken the immigration gap earlier and harder than others.
At least in the field of immigration, the candidates share the same views: sharper borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This topic, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly put to the fore when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to see if Jesus would favor her, he laughed at it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally open.
Huckabee's ascent in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent donations and his coincidence storms in Wednesday's debate.
These two were shot up from nowhere because the two wings of the party had not yet been able to agree on one of the better known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000 a candidate has the party from the beginning and is convincingly united with a victorious message about the size of America and a twinner on both wings of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No noble title seems to have been sold, no politician paid Paris hotel bills, no extramarital toes had been sucked.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has veiled donations for the British ruling Labour Party over over 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something without which the fought Gordon Brown would have come out well.
When, two months ago, the Prime Minister had withdrawn the request for a election, in a deplorable way, insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion polls had not affected this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed himself, the once feared Brown from Stalin to Mr. Bean has developed.
The unwise rescue of Northern Rock, a beaten bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Badly thought-out proposals to change tax laws have raised corporate associations against the government.
The tax loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative care.
A trio of generals in retirement started a rebellion in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: to be ministers of armed forces, they claimed to be part-time jobs.
Now there are the various donations of David Abraham's; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary General (and her former vicar) has already resigned.
Nothing of this means that Brown is irrevocably breaking off.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point, according to which they feel it impossible to rule.
Neither do people like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new troop takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be with it for a long time, this delay is over: the public service begins to fail; the cabinet ministers begin to chatter; the press is looking for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
If he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his commander.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax authorities, for example, are related to decisions taken by Brown as chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if this was not directly involved in Blair's miscarriage - as in the long "money for noble title" investigation of political party financing - the voters may assume that it was him.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not as bad as she looks
The sins are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died or was completely gone.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's, of course, has always promised Stalinist tendencies: a reliable, solid and easily brutal government.
The new tide for political donations is a good example.
The garbouske of Abraham, who compares his donations with his nonprofit gifts, says he does not wish for public recognition of his benevolence.
That may be the case, but the decision on it was not up to him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who says he knew of Abraham's agreement, but not that she is illegal, will naturally have to ask herself some questions; just as Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial operator, was told about the extraordinary donations in October.
However, Brown has not yet been involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his takeover in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered this determination by taking a known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject, in order to fill the measure, by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be drawn are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it's one thing for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things that Mr Brown needs to do, how to find a permanent chairman for the independent public life committee, which has been unrestrained for six months, and to move forward with a comprehensive reform of political party financing.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through incompetent justice and solid competence.
Card sharks
Does the credit crisis affect America's credit card market?
If blood is in the water, it is only natural that back fins whirl up.
Now that America's real estate market is falling, the predators have the country's credit card market in the visor.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion when the risk of infection of underfinanced loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases both in the accounts and in the room rates, which measure the proportion of loans which are not available or are too late for more than 30 days.
The HSBC announced last month that it has taken a 1.4 billion dollar fee collection from its American consumer finances, partly due to the weakness of credit card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and halls are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third quarter of the room rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the Council can partly be explained by technical factors.
A change in the US Private Insolvency Laws in 2005 resulted in an abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large part of the credit card losses; the number of applications (and thus Saleis Fees) would rise again, whether the general conditions for creditors deteriorate or not.
Industry also reports solid payment rates showing how much of its debt consumers pay off each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the output figures for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct sources of infection between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: it is more likely that consumers will accept credit card debts, now that home loans dry out.
However, the card issuers look at the cash flow instead of capital values, therefore falling home prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower's creditworthiness.
You can even be of advantage to the card exhibitors.
Incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates fall if the real estate is less than the value of the loan; as a result, the card debt under the repayment priorities becomes more important.
Card issuers can also react much faster and more flexible than creditors to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid revaluation of assets.
"We won't wake up one day and evaluate the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's main financial adviser.
Even if a sudden undercoverage crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are considerably more real.
If lower home prices and a credit reduction in America push into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more bitter future.
Keep looking forward to these shark fins.
British bankers confess guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be brought to court for their role in the fraudulent system with the former main financial manager of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their requests in debt on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocently for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications resources for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000, in order to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been started on January.
But during a hearing in court before the U.S. district judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone blamed for a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK in the course of extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
The allegations originally filed against them in 2002 drew attention to the fact that he was the objective of an investigation by the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The charges against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claimed that they had come to Houston in 2000 to avoid a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron paintings that contributed to tearing the company into the bankruptcy trust.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew that it was actually of considerable value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to participate in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow falsely argued to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for their shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the 20 million dollars went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others cut about 12.3 million dollars, according to the charges.
In January 2004, Fastow was guilty of conspiracy for his role in the Enrons Pleite in two charges.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow has a six-year prison sentence in the state prison of Louisiana.
Kopper has a sentence of three years and a month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free of charge on the basis of a $1 million deposit that required them to live in the United States in expectation of the trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the nation, broke down in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of bookkeepers could no longer cover up billions of debts or make weak businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The enron founder Kenneth Lay and former Chairman Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced to their roles in connection with the Enron collapse last year.
Skilling is a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were voided after he died of heart disease last year.
Not quite below in Moscow
The price of a plane of the Gulfstream G550 brand, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough reach to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But that's change for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers space for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you asks for so many seats because it is for a private family or a business president."
Fier was at the Gulf Stream stand last Friday at the Millionairesausstellung, a four-day orgy of showy consumption that was organized in a nested exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital city.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition booths, hoping to be interested in new Russians coming to money, from Mahagoni-tapped yachts up to diamond-wrapped autogrills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully took a shiny orange Porsche at the next trade fair stand.
"That's a nice car, but it's change of money compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
Heated by an oil tree, the Russian capital seems to be flooded with money like Dallas at its glamorous times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to huge wealth and went to Europe, where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab fleets of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear as the most visible liberating sponsors in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in the gold rush.
Anderswo in Moscow this week a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas about how to sell high-priced goods on markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, who have a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived under the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-kept and the men are all worthy of wealth."
While going through the halls on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients a millionaire.
"I looked at the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed primarily aimed at the new kingdoms, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand several hours in storage to visit a colossal warehouse, which squeezingly put Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knife, Mövenpick Ice Circle, customized billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy Bears next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 Euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who had sat patrioticly at a stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image from hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brand with limited quantities that would not market themselves in a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil, said that he had sold two 70,000 dollar mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with all kinds of gold threads.
Also on the first night Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company equipped high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company sold the grellen orange Porsche for 170.000 dollars to a Russian millionaire.
Until the afternoon of Sunday, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer requirements, said he would have sold three car cooler glasses for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, the associated chain bracelets equal, for 55,000 dollars each.
He showed a reporter a car tire that was developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, making it look like a roub lettersad.
The cost: $22,000 for a quadruple.
"The Russian millionaire, the ostrich leather wheel or a picture of his wife's face from cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30- or 40-way garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russiche Millionaires" would not at present express much exclusivity, given the rise of local property prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not already in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could do at least as if they were rich at a booth operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set four red telephone cells according to British model, which were stuffed with mountains of false million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said his employees would have printed out 500,000 false banknotes for the Millionairesmesse.
Passersby stopped to throw the money around, mobile phonephotos, as they lean back in the middle of the substitute wealth, to let friends cut, or simply to infect a few million.
"See, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Trapped operation suspects death in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest thank you when Ronald Livingston saw the big glass window of Just a Little Healthier Restaurants here and watched as an ambulance on the white Cape Cod held two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon after that, there was a police car there.
And then there was another.
"Then I saw the car of the medical body inspector coming," Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, said on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The audience learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a trial conducted by an unauthorised cosmetic surgeon who did not identify the police and who worked at the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help to clarify a mysterious death that sent a grief through the leadership of the Newark police.
Since September 2006, Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard working and persistent," said Mr. McCarthy about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Newark police officer working for the alcohol control commission, leaving behind two sons, 14 and 11 and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for the prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine if Arroyo died as a result of unauthorised surgical treatment.
"That's one of the ways," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3 a.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have not reported much about their investigation or about the owner of the house listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say whether Mrs. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators try to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a faded rose shrub stands in the short front garden and a Dalmatian bell is ringing behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung by hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark for the first time after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him find himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, "You have to pay attention to this or that," he said.
"She was always here when I arrived and she was always here when I went.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will reduce interest rates leading to a rise in world stock markets
The shares jump yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets by further reductions in interest rates, strengthened by appreciating comments from the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Central Bank, said that politics must react "flexibly and pragmatically" to the continued pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down dangerous markets, given signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulences "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October".
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further strengthening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is willing to enter and stabilise the credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest reductions.
The remarks also helped to calm Wall Street, given other bad news from the US economy, now that sales of US real estates reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their global employees, in a cost reduction measure to offset heavy losses from their lost US mortgage credit bets.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry index spread by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13.289.40, while the wider S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165,5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of UK standard values.
Germany's index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the resumption of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined, since strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantees from the European Central Bank, granted to European commercial banks, was given to a significant 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and to feed further funds into the London money markets increased as the credit tensions were seen to increase the three-month "libor" rates for lending between UK banks by 6.59 percent on their highest since late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England faced with decision on the statements of Owai Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of which is almost as difficult as the other.
Who is going to beat 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election president, is here on call at least under this special title to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive director, gradually fills itself with applications for national electoral offices, if not even for which in part-time.
Whoever does not get the sixth beat position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly it.
It is never easy to fasten exactly what a person allows to reach the top of his profession while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes because of lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket, where the selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to climb?
Is it fair to Shah when he does it?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young managers with good conclusions that the business knows well should be transported.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go under.
Of course, figures have a major influence on decisions, but opportunities do.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time, if he can take a wicket and a battling must get regular chances of order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the selector is more complicated.
There were many who have been better in the last season than, for example, when James Anderson was, who apparently will play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison himself declares himself healthy and how the wind gets stuck in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium, only one issue of view can be considered.
The choice could choose the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was still fighting to consolidate himself, who made the breakthrough a major test-cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, will follow their conservative instincts and belly feeling for Shah's greater experience about Bopara's youthful enthusiasm after another discussion during the current web session at Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88-debt-innings speak in Bombay, 43 top-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22 years old, and excellent balance against turned balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection from the pickers as Vaughan, was healthy to take his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his stroke, which was still obvious in Bombay.
In contrast, the All-Kannner from Essex has a penetrating joy of life.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket square and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he had recently hit a vehicle with four-wheel drive in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to pull out his vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call on his teammate Alastair Cook who had observed this from a distance, and to say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he cones his middle pace with some effect here on the playing fields which seem to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Perhaps this is the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean Shah might not stand up well, if, as the tea set of Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus shipments of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived yesterday in Baghdad, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas had expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had expelled from their homes.
At Mansour Bus Station, before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi Army has stopped killing people," he said, regarding the Shiite militias of the militant clergy Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to reset at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the vast Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia supported by the US helped to drive Al-Qaida out of her bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe, who had been expelled from his house in Sleikh in the north of Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had asked his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaida militias in Sleikh and that they needed my support and those of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many told that they had been lured by the increasing peace in the capital since the US drop increase and the growth of local "groups affected" citizens, which armed and in cooperation with the American military defend their districts.
But more spoke of having been forced home by visa problems and foresight of funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
"We were well visited by al-Maliki Syria and the government no longer urged the Iraqis to give visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were expelled from the Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have failed.
There are fears that a sudden flow of refugees will again be agitated by sectarian tensions and there will be conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest state is leading in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
In a field of education, the Saarland countries express the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I told a non-saar country yesterday for the 50th time that we were not French" - this slogan posterizes the smallest federal state on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in Saarland's education system, which lies in the education monitor of the Institute of the German Economy Cologne (IW) at 5th place.
The universities are already cooperating closely with neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree.
The proportion of foreign students is accordingly high at 15.6 percent.
But also the country children bring Saarland in an above-average number to the universities - many of them without a degree at the gymnasium.
"The vocational education system is used in Saarland," says Axel Plünnecke, IW's education expert.
More than every fifth youth acquires his right to study at a vocational school, so Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination of vocational and academic training is also relatively strong.
The equipment with dual courses is the second best in Germany, measured by the population.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third in recent years.
For this reason, the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we have initiated a number of reforms in general schools," says one speaker from the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced national comparative tests.
To start learning the children earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that now also copies other federal states.
Whether or not the performance of the students improves in a sustainable way will only show future comparative studies.
In Pisa 2003 the proportion of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
However, Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
Bavaria is expecting better.
And foreign language skills in Pisa are not measured to the dissipation of the Saarland countries - in this area you could score otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbours is mandatory to Gymnasia - even if the Saarland countries are not French.
Chávez adjusts the clocks
In Venezuela the clocks will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez lets the timepieces in the South American country turn back by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
According to Venezuela's Official Journal, the clocks are set to the world time for less than four and a half hours, according to a new law.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez justified his decision, inter alia, that the United States of America had imposed the classification in time zones too full hours.
Furthermore, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with the neighboring country of Colombia because of a hostage.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia remains, he will not have relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this on my own because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is driving a constitutional reform on which the people of the oil country have to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform he would significantly increase his power in the country.
As a result of the dispute, Uribes decided to withdraw Chávez from the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which concerned the release of hostages.
Uribe had criticised Venezuela with his decision to spit on his face on Sunday.
Also in Spain Chávez is in all mouths.
A new cell phone ring will provide for furore in the country: "Por que no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
Spain's King Juan Carlos, on the recent Iberoamerica Summit, spoke to him of the constant calls of the left populists, who had driven him over his mouth.
German Threatened 2007 Wage Minus
Despite the strong economy, German workers are facing a real wage loss this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees could expect 2007 to be less on the salary account than in the previous year.
"Sudden to this are the modest wage developments, the increase in VAT and the price of food and energy," said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research at the "Image" News.
New loads could also be added to unemployment insurance for workers.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrück newspaper", while the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, if the Federal Employment Agency should not be embarrassed to ask for loans or subsidies at the federal government, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and petroleum products had driven the inflation rate to the highest level for 13 years.
Prices increased by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the heavenly twin of the earth
In spite of their life-consuming atmosphere, Venus is more similar than previously thought: The European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind vortex on the Poles, as they also occur on earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that it is flashing on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided evidence - it felt electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The flashes on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory", lightnings have created life on earth: thunderstorms are supposed to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there ever was life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there should be little living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times closer than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus is perhaps the devil's twin of the earth, but it's a twin," Russel said.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the Earth in mass and size, has taken on such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus's research, since since the early 1990s there was no special probe to investigate this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighboring planet with the Earth are greater than initially adopted," the Esa informs.
In addition to the already known cyclone wind on the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud sweater on the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaciale e Fisica Cosmoca.
The second inner planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also called morning or evening stars, circles around the sun in nearly 225 days.
But he turns much slower around himself: a Venus Day takes 243 earthen days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a 92 bar pressure hardly reminds of the earth, scientists assume that both planets have been created under very similar conditions.
On both of them water was gathered, which remained on the earth in oceans, but on Venus was lost into space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in carbonates, it makes up the majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor's office.
Indirectly he criticized the SPD for their attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and has requested the great coalition to end the dispute to receive the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a split nation to the outside world on this question," Köhler said to the trade sheet.
At the same time, Köhler's understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama was signaled by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President emphasized, but he took Merkel in protection from the accusation that she would pursue a new China policy.
"The Chancellor did not distance himself from the traditional one-China policy.
China also knows that," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had shown indirect disgust over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from ranks of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier had complained about the Union's "window policy" in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lamas in the chancellor's office, there was severe irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership has not only invited German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the Foreign Ministers of both countries according to the information provided by the SPIEGEL.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao has now asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the Dalai Lamas' reception as a mistake.
China rejects it when European politicians officially receive the religious leaders of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he tried to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns of Krawallen as in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of Krawallen as in France.
Everything had to be done to prevent social discontent from being discharged into violence in Germany was demanded by the Federal Minister of State.
Barrikaden burned, Randalier shot the police with shotguns: After the heavy youth collars in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We need to be careful not to build up and discharge social explosives in our case.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" appearing in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
Bund, countries and municipalities were already working hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam conference, the first successes have already been demonstrated."
However, it was too early for warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In northern suburbs of Paris, youths had delivered heavy street battles with the police in the last nights.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
Greater integration efforts by the Federal Government, however, requested the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the Krawalle in France, Kolat warned of "respiration effects".
The situation in Germany is not as fragile as in France.
However, there was still a need for action.
Colat pointed out that the unemployment rate of young people with a migration background is "above average" under 25 years.
More training places must be provided in particular.
Kolat stressed: "We need to give young people a perspective."
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than in France, "social control takes place in the families".
Furthermore, many young people with a migration background did not want to destroy what their parents have built up here.
Kolat said, "But we still have to watch out."
One must give young people "a quick opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of the police were in use, a helicopter flew across the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning trashs and cars.
Since the day before, a bid of around 1,000 security forces has provided peace.
The police will go through as long as necessary, Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
During the night of Tuesday, around 80 police had been injured at Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following note, the disturbances took over from Toulouse.
The Krawalle was inflamed by a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the prosecutor's first findings, the police are not to blame for the death of the young people.
In the Empire of Angela Wolke
The chancellor's reality-free appearance documents that the coalition is in the end - and that there is nothing to be expected of her itself.
What country does this Chancellor actually live in?
After her dismal appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was wretched and impoverished, one must say: not here - not in the country that had finally to be ruled by her.
The allegation that they focus too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with a misrepresentative sentence.
That's provincial, she said, and first showed that she doesn't want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, she documented for all the recognizable reasons of their accusation.
There was no real interest or even feeling a sense of the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented himself: an uplifted politician who is fleeing to foreign policy and who remains in danger even there.
Example of climate protection: It praises itself for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how to achieve the climate goals in this country.
All of all, the self-loyalness - so much indifference the CDU chief had failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the floss that the upswing of the people arrives.
Thus, she corrupts her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of talking nicely to the world.
But within the realm of Angela Wolke, internal policy problems are an issue.
Pediatric poverty and the concerns of low earners?
She's got a few supplements left.
It is significant how often she promises to be when it comes to the child's supplement.
Three approaches Merkel needs there to bring out a half straight set.
It stumbles like a strange terrain when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attack
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney provide a tough exchange of views - and now have to fear an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already taking place on the first topic.
He has made New York a "portion for illegal immigrants" and Mitt Romney submits his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This, in turn, is countered by serious accusations: "I would say his own house was a port for illegals," replied Giuliani and suggested to the former governor of Massachusetts to have employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: because the Republican base still has no clear favourites, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
The self-wrought 30 seconds videos that Internet users have sent in via YouTube are hardly more than a keyword.
"With this kind of isolationism we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain suggests to his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets a strong reading of the Levites from the Vietnam Venetian when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", a method of questioning which simulates drowning as torture.
However, the fact that the main issues of the campaign are beyond Iraq's war and torture debates shows the reactions of the Hall Republic of St. Petersburg in Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, the Auditorium is inflamed by chance.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," says Romney, crushing and calling on the public in front of the base and television to say that he was still one of the abortion supporters in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to the conclusion that he is asked about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns in civil for the first time
One day after his resignation as an army chief, the Pakistani leader Musharraf was appointed president.
It ended eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was appointed for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television transferred the ceremony to the President's Palace of Islamabad live.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his office as an army chief to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani, and with this he was bowing to international pressure in particular from the US.
Eight years after his seizure of power in an unblooded military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civil head of state.
With his resignation as commander of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core requirement of opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Advocate General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will soon withdraw the state of emergency and thus meet a further demand of the West.
The Supreme Court of the Land, which Musharraf had occupied with him after the suspension of the state of emergency at the beginning of November, had rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan during an attack on a military convoy and four more injured.
According to an army speaker, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock Return
Germany's supergroup of the Seventies again plays music: The three band members of Harmonia took their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
A contribution from their great time "Live 1974" appears to be a revival.
Already back then they were much more famous abroad.
The enthroned sensation then takes place in the shape of three set gentlemen on the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of them, his cables and especially his buttons.
Dieter Moebius thrones in the flower-white shirt at 63 years in the middle.
Links flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, seen from the Auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is focused on the console.
Everyone contributes to sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band replays Harmonia has caused some excitement among her her lovers.
In which one may reveal here: targeted requests showed that the name, although the name was shrouded by collective pop memory, was by no means so sustainable in order to miss this band for 32 years.
But why should not the German also celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
Especially what is called misleading Krautrock was always more valid in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry gave the survivors of the Cologne Group Can 2003 the echo prize for the living work, the hall saw in questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Laudatio, the amazement knew no bounds.
At concerts, Michael Rother later stunned with the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the explanation in the foreign community is one.
The memory has already been overwhelmed with harmony because the trio existed for only two years and at this time also developed a much lower power of action than was subsequently assigned by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First you played in the basement under the Berlin stage.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a plate label maintained by the church.
Rother had just helped out at Kraftwerk and then played a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, the perhaps most radical German group at that time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians to exile for Forest in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as urban communities.
Less ideological than in the commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to be plagued as a nanny.
Rather in superlative artist's dasin.
It is thought that a whimple of the singing club Harmonia Ottenstein and of art was also a name in the block waste.
Some of them held Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
For so late and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The rice collection was not the sole purpose of self-invention.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was included in a concert in Griessem, in front of an almost 50-member record scene, as someone believes to de-contain himself.
From Rother came the desire to force Harmonia and practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric-Spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flamming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
The Griessemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Gröland has set itself the goal of maintaining the herbrock as an ancient German contribution to living music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, within the framework of the Woldtronics festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
With which the entire range of influences of the herbrock would be surrounded by the following pop music.
Harmonia fills out the empty space of the supergroup.
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most special sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures showing the producer with harmonia in the farmer's room.
The legends serve projections of further black and white photographs of wired equipment.
Before that, the three veterans are again dealing with improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drum to unlock the instruments via self-made effect devices unheard of tones.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three into the technical deepened tüftler.
Nor does the choir of the house change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, sound clouds are hated and certain and sung in a beautiful place with "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in blues than in music universities (Can), technologies (forcework) or on escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever calls here "'68!" is not quite wrong, and Harmonia can't get away from it now.
The most obvious is thoroughly considered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob you of nerves or bring great happiness to fleeting moments.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
Two films deal with the Balkan War with "The Hunting Party" and "Mordic Peace".
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and baller or they are too rough.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because all too many nice-important roles in well-being films for women and all too many press conferences on Buddhism are making you want to look forward to it.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - If the hunter becomes hunted" (Why do film titles have to be as long today and werder as Lokführer-Freitbehörde?).
He provides a wonderful eye-catching representation: basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become of pleasure if the fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has for a long time left behind his best times, but who himself as a ruinous monument of his downfall still preserved considerable remains of the former charm.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Mordic Peace", which also starts this week, continues only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
With "Mordic Peace" you can make a short process: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from kosovarian heeling guns, which one prompt still falls in love with them.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not represented as the sole root of all evils here, the far-seat film loses itself all too quickly in baller and action.
There remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with war for that.
On the other hand, the "The Hunting Party" can be explored in a very exemplary way, why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who are opening up to track the Serbian upper war criminals "the fox" might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and screenwriter (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are very similar: both times small teams go into the woods to accomplish something that the military cannot do and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not easy to let the come down cynics be with heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to lend him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnierin.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" will go down the brook when the reporters have managed within the last five minutes in the time-limit procedure what Nato, CIA and all the world's head-money hunters have failed to do in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians to fair revenge.
This is so bad that we would like to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinematographic logic.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to argue that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (this is an exception) not to be too intensive in the persecution due to secret political agreements.
But the good community and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes into mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the desk of the poet: "I feel that I see the swollen foreheads, pointing out: how strenuous it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have just such swallow heads, but they indicate how strenuous it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently this newspaper reported that all Iraq films were Hollywood's big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always applicable: If a star drives around on the world's crisis heroes or minefields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio will come out.
It may be that all the conflicts are just too close to time.
After all, it had to pass decades before Hollywood was able to film a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films are probably still going to ripen - the now classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have never been single-mindedly celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But we may know today, where every mass murder comes home in real time on the same two screens, even too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the scriptwriters of the uncertainty that it takes to tell good stories.
After all, "his or his non-being" or "The Great Dictator" became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know how the Nazi regime really existed.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe you need to have the sarcastic distanced artist's view of Romancian Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "That's just because some things never change.
Big cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be murdered in a cruel way and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
By Beust, critique for Olympia-Absage
The decline of the mayor from Hamburg's application for Olympic Summer Games has been strongly criticized by politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But by Beust, realism encourages the assessment of opportunities.
On Wednesday, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, Chief Executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described a refusal as "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed as great motivational forces in the city as the Olympic Idea.
"Unless this goal, the sport-political momentum could not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to inherit the project but to find a new long-term approach to "from a changed timeline".
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with previous statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on a Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation on a Munich application for the 2018 Winter Games, which was expected at the beginning of December.
"This preference means for us that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period we have been considering until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreamable for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to build a chance by already inheriting the plans," said HSB President Günter Ploss on Wednesday.
A refusal of the application is also contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception at the General German University Sports Association's General Assembly.
There, von Beust called the application of Hamburg for the Universiade 2015 "not as a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had not nominated Hamburg as a candidate city until last week.
The SPD Citizenship Group accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grassbrook has been delayed for years by the Senate because it has placed on the Olympia map and excluded the building of the apartment," said SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Kleinen Grasbrook had always called for an integrated planning for Olympia and a later use of residence, the CDU put on one side the "event factor".
The 2012 Olympic Summer Olympics application had triggered a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg had failed in Leipzig, however.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Those who combine the terms of Sweden and wooden box think of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Is that right?
Currently, wooden boxes in Sweden are throwing dark shadows on Warhol's working directory.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo boxes listed there from the "Type Stockholm" are fakes.
After several months ago the Swedish newspaper "Express" expressed doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes in 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now come to a sobering conclusion: The six "Brillo Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén made the Moderna Museet 1995 as a gift, are copies - and probably also the majority of the about one hundred more Brillo boxes of the "Type Stockholm", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The history of history is blocked, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard cardboard of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museet 1968 - with Warhol's consent - produced hundreds of brilliform boxes from cardboard: these were not from Warhol (for cost reasons) but were supplied directly from the Brillo cartonage factory.
It was not works of art, it was their models, it was mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission in 1968 to produce a few brilli-wood boxes in Sweden, but they were not issued in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which were entered into the history of art and auction as authorized original Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them scored more than $100,000 on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 it had been produced and exhibited around a hundred wooden boxes in Sweden, which Warhol had then left him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were only produced in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
Warhol had been dead for three years at that time.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at Moderna Museet, has also examined three private Swedish-owned Brillo Boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press panels were first founded and smeared, and then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The 1990 structure of the copies on the other hand reveals that the colour was applied directly to the press plate with a paint roll without a baseing - also it is not oil, but acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxes," says the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another conclusion, the Moderna Muset will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would be "severe accusations" that are raised in the soap powder boxes.
But since then they have been in unrelenting silence.
Rebellant soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had left behind in a hotel in Manila and had demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not answer bloodshed, said leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused President of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Governmentless soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under the use of tear gas.
The dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Thursday because of a failed coup in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly stop with some 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were supposed to guard him, had apparently passed over to him and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyale government troops shut down the district around the noble hotel.
The President called an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' actions.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously ordered the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said that other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by corruption accusations for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene of the attempted mutiny of some 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
After almost 24 hours, the uprising failed to join the army.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven coupt attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.

However, the two companies kept open all options, in particular to further increase the participation in Freenet AG.
Discussions between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.

So far, the holding of United Internet and Drillisch held directly 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares.
