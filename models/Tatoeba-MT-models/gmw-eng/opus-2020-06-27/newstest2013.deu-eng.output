A Republican strategy to oppose Obama's re-election
The leaders of Republicans justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth, reaffirming that the electoral fraud in the US is rarer than the number of people killed by the lightning strike.
By the way, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in 10 years in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting participation.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the USA.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have since 2009 announced new laws which make the procedure for registration or the original procedure more difficult.
After the November 2010 elections, this phenomenon gained importance, where 675 new Republican representatives could be registered in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 legislative drafts were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of electoral rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require the voters to present a photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods of early voting, the right to not register as voters on the election day, and the right to vote for which there is a court order.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state has required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to claim such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana Law.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other countries.
Over the last two years, they have promoted legislation in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million elected persons, have no photo ID issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new pickers do not have such an identification in 2012.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid to get the necessary ID card.
Of the new restrictions, young people, minorities and low-income people are disproportionately affected.
In fact, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of those with a income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID.
This is still enough.
Students who are regarded as voters who give their voice more and more for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs to choose more for the Republican side to use the cards for elections issued by these associations.
Before 2004, no state has demanded proof of citizenship to be elected.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws demanding voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic votes.
Because it is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators promoted laws in eight states in 2011 to abolish the registration of voters on the election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaign for electoral registration in the 2004 general elections has contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of registration of Neuchosen 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five further states aimed at shortening the period of early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters elected in advance were African-Americans, although they represent only 13% of the electorate of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens elected in advance.
In contrast, the whites, who represented 76% of the voters, made up only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their followers have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several legislative drafts were blocked by the veto of democratic governors.
The US Advocate General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of the electoral right more difficult.
The democratic critics advocate the party-political nature of the passed laws and see in them as a clear goal the influence of the results in the states that are leading for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that have passed these laws make up 171 of 270 votes required in the electoral body to win the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the USA.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a greater deterrence on men who have already been undecided for carrying out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We got the opinion of two specialists.
The studies carried out in the USA have had numerous disturbance factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that with follow-up observation after 12 years, the probability of formation of metastasis is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
That is why I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 years if you have a direct relative who was already ill with prostate cancer.
Men of afro-American origin are also at higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient needs to be made truly understandable about the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancers can remain untreated if he does not affect the quality of his life in the long term, and in these cases one chooses to actively monitor the disease.
Today, there is no treatment in many men who have known cancer, since their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are being offered active monitoring and treatment when the disease progresses.
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not be determined.
That's why I still recommend carrying out the test.
But most importantly, it is to talk to his doctor to determine if he should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the international Urology Society, Movember has developed an instrument that makes it possible to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle agent for preventing cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone was eating well and moving sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the cigarette is abandoned, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian cancer society, obesity and adipositas also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, humid, mast-intestinal, esophagus, pancreatic and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against influenza cancer," he adds.
The diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of developing an anaesthetic or mast-drum cancer.
Spices should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by incense, drying or salt may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not complete.
According to the Canadian cancer society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the risk of prostate cancer to be reduced, another showed an increase rather.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family pretension.
"The implementation of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson analyzes
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has caused some excitement last summer, and this for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or "at least false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists it is not completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still no data to be absolutely sure about it.
Nevertheless, let us assume that this is actually the Higgs, as there seems to be only a small risk of being deceived, and let us look at what it is all about.
There is in this world an inevitable intransigable law that causes two objects to not be present at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try it too strong as you will hurt.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law applies to them too: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantum state", with this "state" consisting in the bulk of some of their properties.
From that point on, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione, who obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons, an evil band of anarchists, who are not holy - certainly not this principle, which means that they can actually be located in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure, these bosons are divided into two groups by the Berkeley Labors (which, by the way, is absolutely amazing): the mesons that we will not treat here and the "power particles" by which the great forces of nature are spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
It must be stressed here, however, that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle" which is the "bote" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, if a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is precisely "distorted" in this place, like a gravel stone that was thrown into a pond.
This "disturbation" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
Stable Field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "distorted" so that this boson shows itself.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has to achieve very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be broken by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a size of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep on the refrigerator itself.
And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (as the photon) have no mass.
For what can all these research "be good," Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science, they serve to review the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to examine exactly all deviations between the observations and the forecasts of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who hope that such deviations will be found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes of the model.
One must say that the latter still has great defects, as there is no explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (renews ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN until now.
Impact
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no such thing.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell Labs did not suspect that their works would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first continuous strip laser (the first were pulsated) in 1962 - has already said that the laser was considered to be a "labor toys" at the beginning.
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also emerge from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, today this sensor serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras worldwide and in 2009 it introduced the Nobel Prize for Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you can never really know...
Palliative care - the best way to die...  in Le Devoir
With its Committee on "Death in Dignity", Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer, which devoured him, had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I did seven years," he said, half-heartedly, lying in his bed in his home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in a hurry where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease makes her work: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped with food.
Mutige even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medications, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhoea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"Over the course of our life, we learn that a man is stinging in the standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois's home.
Returning back to childhood is unacceptable humiliation for some.
"This depends on the person's ability", he says, taking a step backwards.
In the opinion of several people who work in the palliative care, major events take place in the midst of these retreats.
The patients who are assigned to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage they are no longer overcrowded by doctors and nurses who care for them with so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation".
But through the illness, I really met my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I no longer have wishes in life," she says, before she accepts that she is set up a mask that helps her breathe.
She still expects a last visit to her son who comes from Italy in the next few days.
At the Victor-Gadbois home you can offer with a group of volunteers body care and help with food intake.
Palliative care is then used if there are no other possibilities.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec there is a bed for palliative care on 11,700 inhabitants.
This is very little if you consider that one day we will all die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both on the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Depending on your wishes, you grant the dying person a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetes patients no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," reports Natalie Savard.
Victor-Gadbois's home is not a day like the other.
In addition to an old 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family meeting in the yard and is well supported by his pillows, while one moves to his honor, a 36-year-old man who is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
"For six months three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients at the age of less than 45 years," Dr. Christiane Martel tells us alarmedly.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois are from their home, 47% are from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of the Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care to relieve the suffering of patients when the latter reach the final stage of their lives, both at home, at the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the company for domestic palliative care in the Montreal area specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
This very great inadequacy in the health care of Quebec ensures that several doctors specialised in palliative care face with concern the adoption of a law on the regulation of death aid and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent figures of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in order to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not capable enough to ensure that all the right to high-quality palliative care is granted before accepting to go to death aid.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency for 14 days with great pain, without taking measures to relieve them.
I fear that the patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients in spite of the worst prognosis to the last day.
The survival chances of Hélène Richard were minimal already when she stopped a difficult chemotherapy therapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she answered me that she was sorry that I was up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nurse for not accepting this wish after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be stated clearly that palliative care is not omnipotent in the pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of the Palliative Care of the Company of the Home Palliative Care of the Grand Room Montreal, 8% of patients do not address pain treatment.
At the end of life, therefore, doctors often resort to the terminal sedation, which is due to either sporadic or permanent sedation of the patient until the time of his death.
We can no longer do as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to access this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pains are not eased say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to sleep me" but "I want my pain to be eased."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship of Canadian health research institutes.
Real Estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the Road Construction Office, the construction industry's businesses, the money-creating political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in the building industry, officials, politicians, trade unions and Mafioso are entangled.
An "industry" which was very expensive for the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has been breaking down since drastic measures were taken," says Jacques Duchesneau, Member of Quebec and former head of Montreal Police.
The scandal was discovered by him because of a detailed investigation of the misappropriations related to the road construction contracts in Quebec, which the Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed to at that time.
The "Duchsneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010", he emphasizes, "the Ministry of Transport alone has saved a billion dollars in contracts", because some have taken their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already fallen two mayors," he adds, hoping that you will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, set up in 2011, also makes great efforts with its troops to audit, determine and analyse the government.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau-Truppe", which has been causing the "channeling cartel" of Montreal to be held back in the artificial collapse of the contracts since 2009...
In the last few weeks, she has made a series of house searches and has filed accusations about fraud and corruption against municipal commanders such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburbs.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting lubrication funds in the exchange of public contracts.
Incidentally, engineers of the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia, were accused.
The latter has aroused attention by declaring to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
For several years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambia had his hand in the game everywhere by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were in power at that time.
He also agreed to have organized illegal funding for former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandy.
channelling contracts whose costs have been artificially extinguished by it
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of 736,000 dollars as a contribution to sewerage contracts, the cost of which he artificially bleached.
Other officials of the Road Construction Office admitted that they were ashamed by artificially extinguishing invoices with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, a organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately looking over a shadow budget that filled his cash registers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which led Montreal to a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal to beat the alarm.
As mayor of the district Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she refused to sell a municipal property from 2010 onwards, which was purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million to builders in the booming real estate market.
70% Black money in election campaigns
From the investigation, which is eventually carried out, she says that she "draws on a thread that enables you to understand the functioning of the ant-immigrated system in order to stop the evil and denounce the guilty."
She says that the process is "painful, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, however, needed an investigation unit only for Montreal, as well as a supervision to prevent a return to questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau in turn notes that "Authors have stolen several hundred million dollars", but is thinking about the role of "mandators who are in the picture about tactics" if they were not involved in fraud!
Based on a 70% share of black money in financing the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this is only a weak declination of reality."
The Quebec Government proposes to limit donations to $100, which he says would not change the situation: "Unless the campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by moving things on the ground with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages Quebec's international reputation and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau calls on those who laugh at it to take a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have adopted a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on her side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
These elements blaze me daily to improve my level of play.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I'm not going to get excited.
Since my beginnings in the center of the preparatory training of INF Clairefonttaine up to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They are thus making use of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new entrances of this summer are used to presenting games very high levels.
They also know that each training unit is crucial.
This leads to a player like me who wants to offer his forehead and give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position in the game.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played at the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti brings respect to all technicians.
In Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from an injury series.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation of my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the top rider's seat.
But we're listening in ambush.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the Eighth Final in this way.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as possible.
Everything is possible from now on.
However, we will have to say our word against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group in front of Porto, so that we can carry out the replay of the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for that...
To become a great European association, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
In financial terms, the PSG gives itself the means to take concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as this was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really our heart to cut off this title.
We've been close to it in the last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to bear the victory.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have completed with 79 points.
Usually you should be with 79 points masters...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux ring around the title, I think we have the stuff to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept this perfectly.
But if we win in a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something you can blame us for, this is certainly a bit frustrating.
It's a question of what people are still expecting.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
In the Champions League we have proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the eighth finale since two seasons, and who has also made huge spending!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to be a game break with 15 points advantage!
This said that our opponents and the French championship would be disregarded.
Lyons and Marseilles, who were not good in the last season, were "born" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that despite all the difficulties, we have finally won it.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much better that you speak of a "Zlatan dependency."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many gates.
That's why he came and he proves that he is the star of Ligue 1.
Wherever he played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people surrounding him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages the others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders worldwide, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from taking some time off.
I have seen things there that have strengthened me.
Today I manage to achieve good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our teaching, and today we have to show exemplary behavior.
What opinion do you have about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the Qualifications Group for the World Cup.
The National Trainer is strict, close to the player and encourages victory.
As it was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualified us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "bleus" to Brazil.
Is the discrepancies forced in Spain on 16 October (1:1) a start?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone's been working for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin, payment and sale is possible without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
Furthermore, as is so often the case in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system designed by bank monopoly leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but can be converted into dollars, euros, etc.) as well as a protocol for secure exchange like BitTorrent, which enables the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After having reached a peak of $30 (€23) in June 2011, Bitcoin dropped to $25 months later before he recovered at around ten dollars today (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, in an October report on virtual currencies, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this.
She describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "like the traditional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits", which are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy through games (and sometimes exchange them).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trading is controlled and processed each time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositors of the billing book, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the content of the file it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the billbook of public accounts distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to insert this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task launched on the computers, whereby the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker who has privilege, adds this additional line.
It is a splitting of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "caught".
The aim is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can effortlessly check if it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay with the same money for cheating twice very fast (less than 10 minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other will remain without connection, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but can be shared up to a hundred millionth, leaving a certain amount of room...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement of the computing power.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites providing services for bitcoin were attacked and the bitcoin deposits stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not concern the actual protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a real money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these shortcomings.
Important actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analysed the billing book and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November a "Mega lock-sale" was launched.
"There were thirty thousand dollars exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify one address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat says that he has thousands of users.
A general trend has to be seen in which hierarchical systems are considered in favour of more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to go through, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
By the way, the ECB's report provides for the re-evaluation of the various risks that are considered to be high today in the event of a success of this currency.
We were withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capisa and Surubi).
NATO and the USA are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we punished Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as those who were injured and injured.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Usbeken and Tajiken have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I have observed from a hill planted with almond trees, financed by French loans, was done properly.
The truck and tank convoys flooded by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014 there will be no more inflows of the Taliban into Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was crossed by war because of the struggles of the various insurgent groups.
Her takeover of power was then regarded as a sort of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved until today.
Former Mujaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important characters of the anti-Soviet war have returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into business makers by confiscating property of the government to sell them as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefited from the massive American award of sub-contracts.
They made their way, and most of them were not themselves involved in the battles.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that does not consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as did those who could make use of American subsidies: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have been in contact with the modern world and have enjoyed their advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including armed parties, are possessed by mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is viewed everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Are the authorities under whose command they will stand considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from a certain decentralisation in the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the 1964 Constitution, the US wanted to make a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, particularly on the occasion of the April 2014 elections.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is the priority.
In a country based on 30 years of war, state control of infrastructures would have been necessary.
The rumor has been spread that Afghanistan has immense land treasures.
This strengthens the impression that the Western countries were only on the spot to empower themselves.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for an export via the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, let the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) make their excavations at the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls and boys, Institute of French at the universities, French Institute, Cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military action" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, in dozens of mountain villages, has carried out numerous non-profit works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation to try to win the "hearts and spirits" and achieve the impossible task of compatibility of aid and offensive actions.
This work, for which a large number of local workers were required, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural areas.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving the local living conditions, which are very hard in these often over 2000 meters high valleys.
Dozens of written requests have been received from small agricultural projects by municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
In order to free farmers from the uprising led by foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, is their wish, the continuation of small, well-controlled and directly relevant civilian aid would be necessary for their benefit.
A Constitution with the Breaking Bar in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Muhammad Mursi.
While Egypt remains more than ever divided in terms of the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited authority, it has decided to place everything on a map.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly would adopt its final version on the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state of this assembly had given two additional months for the completion of his work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been based on a preliminary text that has been modified several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only provided for an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "step the right with his feet".
On behalf of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time which forces the brothers to refrain from their plans to explain to the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the president, it is also a way of reinventing its public and democratic legitimacy while protesting throughout the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Muhammad Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote well.
In particular, the Egyptian people with this back-up to an over-voting vote will have an ultimatum placed: "You either vote in favour of my draft or I maintain unlimited authority", the latter should supposedly end after adoption of the Constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have failed to comply with the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned away, as they believed they had not been able to apply their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve decision-making capacity, 11 persons, alternate members, were added in all hurrys yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that most of the articles have been adopted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, found it entertaining that the only difference in opinion of the day... was expressed in the time of prayer, because some members of the body felt that the pendial clock of the constituent assembly was not going exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention to itself, is ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Blessedness" is a response to the liberals who only regard this as a propaganda blow.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place on other articles.
In doing so, they are particularly aware of Article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, particularly as regards the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the persons who are invited to an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
One can see in this the first signs of a theocracy".
The fears of the liberals are also nourished by the fact that the next rector of this university is much less moderate than the current one.
"There is currently no real religious commitment to be recognized.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been partially trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he admits that "in relation to Article 220, there may be a plurality, as the terms used are derived from the religious vocabulary.
In particular, this refers to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, Rem. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil courts are competent to decide."
In addition to his religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised by the far-reaching powers he grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that compared to the former regime, these are significantly reduced.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In line with the military's wish, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights defence associations have requested.
The latter also communicate their fears about the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The deed of the blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Furthermore, no more article refers to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef by Human Rights Watch.
In her opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect sacred places, the navel of the world and a sea of Sole
The Blessed Land unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and an unspoiled nature.
AIF mentions the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Move before the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It means that all those who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding feast, walking on the water, the silence of the sea storm and the fishing.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most sanctuaries, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Here, believers go on the path of suffering or the crossroads of Jesus Christ (on Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where was the court, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion, the anointing stone and the grave of Jesus are located.
Here, according to Christian opinion, is the navel of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands in the place where a Christian legend says that the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the wall of appeal, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of various faiths leave Zettel with wishes that will then be fulfilled.
Take a trip to the altitude
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in the year 25 A.D.
They are located on a rocky wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins by themselves.
Everyone else brings an airstrip to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, where it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can reach with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometres.
According to an old legend, pagan gods lived on the mountaintop.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
On just one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
There, old Qumran manuscripts or scrolls are stored from the Dead Sea found in Felshöhlen in the Judean Desert and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There the collection of works by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Bad Al Basha, which houses several rooms of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and bathing servants.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum guides nor souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are rejected in principle.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most devastating chapters of history.
The most moving department is the monument for the children built in memory of the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
There is total darkness when entering the room.
Star functioning.
And the names of the Jewish children and the lands in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main recreational areas of Israel lie on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
At each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinaries and oceanariums.
Amazingly, in the Red Sea also in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and bathed throughout the year.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus even carries no swimmer easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt solsole) and medicinal sludge, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and for the calming of stressed nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Age
This is the secret of the old town of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city was the famous sea route that linked Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda, with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to wander through the narrow streets named after constellations.
Fortuna is to be the legend according to all the hold that touches the walls in the alley with its star sign.
In Jaffa you can find newly married couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can strip through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusades.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and operas are performed today.
Favourites for tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your bad English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is not taken into euros, but in dollars that can easily be changed into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekel).
In the city you usually get ahead by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway and in Haifa the only underground line of the country with six stations that connect the underground with the Upper Town.
In fact, it's an underground cable car.
A trip within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the transport, which includes switching for a trip of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only cosheral food is served, excluding pig meat, sea products, fish without scales and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with hammel and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, different sauces, dried balls of pure beans and peas (palas) as well as fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no soothing dogs.
For this there are many well-nourished cats that roam comfortably and unlightened through the streets.
In the evening, they are even seen sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to treats.
A car rental costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
In addition, insurance costs $15 a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Tickets for museums cost 30 shekels on average.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recovery seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the praised country, which represents an increase of 51% compared to the 2010 comparison period, prior to the withdrawal of visa obligations on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While Members and Citizens' Rights are discussing the benefits of the Law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already acting with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of families living in the home country.
On 1 December, a law entered into force requiring every worker to pass a test certifying knowledge of Russian language.
So far, this scheme applies only to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing sector and in retail.
However, the tests, according to the Federal Migration Authority, will become mandatory for all guest workers in the future.
Not only do you have to pass language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the preservation and extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is official language.
Apart from this law, persons who received their certificates of training and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are also excluded.
Purpose, problem and protection of rights
The audit offices will be under the aegide of the Puschkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendhood, the Moscow State University, the St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can pass the tests in all cities; more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, before the law entered into force in the press, civil rights activists repeatedly asked the following question: What is the result?
What changes does the requirement to show language skills for both the Russians and the guest workers?
Above all, the migration authority's spokesperson is concerned with reducing the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says Viktor Sebelew, Head of the Federal Migration Authority's Office in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must be protected before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Migrants face problems without a job, education, language skills and medical examination.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who put him under the pretext of help into a dark, narrow barracks, where he will endure with dozens of his similar months without food and documents and create 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you will be promised the One, and upon arrival you will be deceived, their passports will be taken away and not received the promised wage," confirms the head of the main administration for labour migration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripov.
Don't yell, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they cannot control the language of the target country, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, rather the evil: only few Turkmen, Usbeken and Tajiken can also afford reasonable primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothing, shoes and school goods.
As a teenager, these children immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It is difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists stress the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status must pass the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no test and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the host workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcome welcome" or "allowed access"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason are bureaucratic obstacles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and for only one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are largely falsified and we are not registered, and from this they are caused by extortion.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajike Umed Huschkadamov says to journalists.
"No cost to hide false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be falsified.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been seized by Federal Migration Authority employees.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get these for nothing: Every migrants who hoped to be able to save the tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant three thousand rubles.
On the fact that the most important direct task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased, both officials and citizens agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time to receive time for a language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills are offered places in areas where there is no need for active understanding with people.
Ministry of the Interior ignored illegal arms market
Proportion of legal weapons in crimes
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans to strengthen the arms law for private gunowners.
This is the response of the authorities to recent events: injured in wedding shootings and seven deaths during the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradov's march.
The police want to ban the carrying of non-death weapons in the public and raise the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will be presented shortly to the Duma.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attracting the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose author - representatives of various arms associations - called on the authorities to distance themselves from "senseless aggravation".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal judge, Wasilij Lesnikov, the Russian BBC service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed with the application of registered weapons during the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a strengthening of the private-owners' law will not prevent criminals from operating on the black market.
In Moscow, according to the author, any weapon can be found for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons enter the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first canal is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel there are illegal weapons stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both the police arms chambers and directly from the law enforcement authorities.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
In many military camps, explosions often occurred.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was arson to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that do not resist international competition and therefore toss the weapons under control on the black market, for example in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggler.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a production of its own, sometimes craftsmanship, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggler," explains the former military member.
Where do these weapons come from?
Experts calculated what proportions each of the five channels has about the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Government Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on weapons.
Most of the illegal weapons are found to be derived from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all the weapons in the black market were there due to the "students of those responsible who had to do with weapons in their work," says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% go back to thefts in arms production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant of a arms store that doesn't want to be named, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations haven't been buying anyone for a long time since they're obsolete.
According to him, it is more common for traders to get the reins in a weapons camp.
A gun, for example, a Pistole of type TT, is purchased via a flag line.
The weapon is displayed and handed over by the fence.
"The dealer brings the weapon to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says
"The police, of course, are aware of everything and therefore, if they cannot comply with the plan to detect crimes, periodic check-out purchases from dealers offering illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"As in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers are the most likely to find out about acquaintances.
I had looked at web pages and blogs when someone drew attention to me and suggested that I come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me, who would take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price of the gun I first learned there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a weapon, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers on the markets, but there you have to go and agree with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets the daughter decide that a tooth has been lost".
At present, I even come to some headlines about a friend I trust.
He's only giving me the impact rings because he knows I'm not running him.
Novices are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was depicted.
"I felt like in the luxury shop," remembers the military member.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer I don't just buy, but ride with the seller in the forest, and there we set up a target disc.
"I can shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we'll negotiate with each other," the expert describes the action.
Shopping from sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No papers are needed or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the right sum of money", says the advertisement on the website "Buy pump gun or gun".
There users place your orders and make requests.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," asks user "Iwan" (literally quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkok".
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless web sites, and buyers who want to buy weapons go up to the network.
People come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in Siberia and let them go of coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The controllers accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a bank machine.
"In reply he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press speaker of the non-profit organization "Pravo na orzhie" Dmitry Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can also go out empty at the end and come behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless web sites, and buyers who want to buy weapons go up to the network.
"People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camp and let coal grow," he says.
A Makarow for 100 US Dollars
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices from 100 to 900 US dollars can be expected.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organization "Pravo na orzhie" you can buy a gun of type Makarow for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is spent in military arms camps of medium rank overseers.
According to the Ministry of the Interior's official statistics, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons throughout Russia fell by 7% to 22.9 thousand in the period January to October 2011, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the USA, fast-food and supermarket workers strike
Every fourth American youth is at some point behind Mc Donald's checkout.
In the past few days, massive protests against low wages in Walmart's stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken have come about.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to wave or whether they will soon go out of the air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple whale and fast-food workers, protest organizers are pursuing the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organized for trade union purposes.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, on which sales took place in the USA, which attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to quantities of hands.
On this day, a number of Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, settled their work together with trade unions and left activists Branches of the chain, whose target group is low and medium-income.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
On average, the goods in the Walmart branches are between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
For this reason, many of the little paid Walmart employees buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are badly paid.
The latter also complain about severe working conditions, such as missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants in the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the health insurance company had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earns $9.5 an hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company increased the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
This is about 1.1% more than they donate for wages now.
If Walmart fully relocated the wage increases to customers, each purchase cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be for them per year compared to today's extra spending of just $12.39.
Supporters of Walmart are pleased to note that there were only nine states protests and they did not cause any losses to the company.
The Black Friday took place from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and in this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart cases on "Black Friday" carried out almost 100 million transactions.
In an interview on the website of the left-winged Huffington Post, the company’s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees were laying down the work and the protest was merely "a further PR-Trick" of the union that organized the protests.
"Free Checkout!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart branches (who are not wanted in this progressive city and therefore inexistent so far), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sell billions, and yet they won't give you any sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, according to federal and New York legislation, the minimum wage is $7.25.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is raised gradually, but not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York get $8.90.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible to spend so little money in New York, I am inconceivable.
There was once a time when nearly a quarter of all U.S. youths were standing behind the Theke after school at McDonald's, but the young were still living with their parents.
Hardly one in it saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, during interviews with McDonald's employees, I am constantly meeting people who complain that they have to deal with this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal Forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which started on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 per hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits the management of business to stand in the way of this goal and to discourage or dismiss trade union members.
On the other hand, management doesn't make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high number of personnel.
Satisfied
That day there were strong protests even before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at noon before McDonald's at Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, including city councilman Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sell billions, and yet they won't grant you sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food staff so that they can obtain a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves!".
According to New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, of which weitem is not all employed in the fast-food industry in which tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet to be seen whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole masses.
"The brain can only be mediocre so far"
The theme of enlarged reality, popular with followers of modern technologies, has been perceived by the lens of a special glasses lately.
At first, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in summer, and in November it became known that Microsoft had also filed a corresponding patent.
However, while talking to the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft Laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the company's scientists.
It encourages the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and create virtual spaces.
- Please briefly describe what research your group is doing.
- We are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has remained largely stuck in the phase, in which pixels are worked on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to look ahead to 5-10 years and predict the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a progress, and today no more Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What's expecting us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much still plays on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
This requires, however, that not only the user, but also his environment be recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of this stupid virtual reality helmet!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overvalued?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution because it raises questions about privacy because you do not always want to inform all the circumstances about its actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but any one in their particular niche.
For example, in the area of the control of objects in public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and scarce, instead of with inviting gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a watch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as gestics and language.
- How so?
- We'd ask you, for example, to give you this box?
They say it and at the same time point out it.
- I'm usually just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual approach.
I think that we will have to work in the near future mainly on the development of new sensor types, which will enable people to capture reactions more closely.
This can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What demands do you make from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth, or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
This way, all current technologies are not good enough for us as developers of algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X- and Y-, but also along the Z-axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The human movements are extremely dynamic and openly said, the present 30 fps are, especially for gestures, too little.
Stephen Bethises developed a touch sensor in our Redmond laboratory with a adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I needed exactly that kind of device, only without touch control and with more pictures per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras may solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to determine how this helps us to identify a position in a three-dimensional way.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft did not present his glasses to the public in contrast to Google.
Do you not think that with regard to the application of the technology of enlarged reality in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in the raised hand on the go, but I think this is the most amazing version of it that would be an "changing" expanded reality, where we could switch from glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and there is their strength (private can only see you), but at the same time their weakness, because an expanded reality by glasses prevents you from working on virtual objects together with others.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics often point to: There is no tangible response!
The hands don't feel anything at all!
What answers will your group give to this objection?
In my lectures, I often talk about the fact that the expanded reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently using the second hand as a slightly unusual projection document.
She's seeing pressure very well!
However, there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "images in the air" something hand-resistant, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the fingers are located creates a feeling that is still so weak at present as a pudding over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to cross the brain?
It makes us think it feels what it should feel if it sees something right now?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried.
There is another task that we will have to fight for a long time here, namely to make a person physically located in a closed space believe that he is located instead in an open, virtually infinite space; here we work on concepts with treadmills (other than fitness studios), moving platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be mediocre, and we still have many busy years ahead of us.
This is what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive to a researcher: on many topics we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", dedicated to the city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the list of high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the beards dressed in red, once at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at the scene meeting or at the feasts.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are also exhibited, they attract great masses of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 1980s or early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and, by his presence on the street, enchants his fellow citizens with a smile in the face and makes them feel good.
A short time ago, he took a swivel organ and became a Petersburger swivel player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role with regard to his artist's existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or Turkish in town for example?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer dealing with the look and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image advisors and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the horror norm, creates aggressions and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Kulturpalast Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I understood that I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters then ended, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I was friends with the painters of the new generation, so with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina", from which came "Puschkinskaja 10", and then was just finished.
It draws me to the theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything, except literature.
And all of this united in your kind of clinic... it was important for me to be at the heart of Petersburg culture, where the best-creating artists were supposed to gather.
In 1995, I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, where up to the renovation work there was a musical-art club for the Bohemian, the house of the Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazz, and I also remember how Schnur came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to the playback, wore close jerseys and one of them was also the current composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became from her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs prior to the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his big career began, but the basics he learned from us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also originates in the art clinic.
Our employees and regular guests went there.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press about the award "Personalities of our City".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and that made me the highlight.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In modern times it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of my thoughts.
I will have an exhibition on "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and is afraid to be like that.
In a clown, all this fades and loses its tragedy.
I love the Great Lakes, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let us save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothing and is oriented on the outside and not on the inside of man.
But maybe you shouldn't give a man your hand, but you should spit him in the face.
The deception disappears through the disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban rotating organ player. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who if not me?
- Can commercial art be nice too?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of the cultures.
The people used to form large groups: Bohemian people loved the one and the simple people the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollars note everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult star has about 100 trailers.
- The appearances of Stas Mikhailow are several thousand!
- To him come abandoned women, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people come and not 10 thousand, therefore there are fewer management, money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not destroy the achievent.
In my youth, I painted such pictures that hung with a collector even in a series of works by Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that normally only come at the end of my career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumer consumption has no culture at all, this is something quite different.
I am a man of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's missing Petersburg?
Good cultural experts.
They say, "Serving culture."
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real Tsars, because the Tsars may not have understood much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good consultants.
In Petersburg, we have those who could be experts, but they are blocked by the way, as it requires higher-ranking experts who judge the first ones properly and clear the way for them.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same applies to the Errta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters need to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural breeding ground, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's much less with us.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the city of St Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Warming or collapsing with Killerasteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earth’s inhabitants on board make themselves looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, is the important question of how we can reproduce ourselves in the weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
In my opinion, many choices do not exist.
De facto, there are only two real planets that we could at least inhabit hypothetically.
"Namally Mars and Venus," says the scientific assistant of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, the Venus surface has a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be possible only at a great height or in the orbit of Venus, that is, in space.
The question of reproduction in space initially addressed the researchers with regard to the flora.
Experiments have already been carried out with plants for half a century.
The fourth generation of peas grown in orbit do not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, watchmen were sent to the world to explore how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It develops a normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a hold; it must be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without solid underground, the chicks die wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely dulled.
The chicks did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Two times we let chicks slip and then set up the whole thing because it's simply impossible to work with them," Vladimir Sychew holds for the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only the same sex species will be found on the Biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special has been identified.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research must be continued," says Vladimir Sychew.
After landing, the space rats got young people.
So far, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals torn out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Contrary to animals, man could be the principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
From ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
There was the biggest risk in Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our gulls flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to life after this flight?
"At last nobody answered this question," says Space veteran Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after their space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolaev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even performed works outside the spacecraft, bore a son.
Nevertheless, there remains a risk.
We only have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more dangerous it is even for flights to the orbit," concludes Cosmonaut Waleri Poljakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet humanity must seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolabor in the preparation center of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a state of silence, the Cosmonauts win routines for work in open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Even though adults feel water is pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It's like the little Ichtyanders are bearing witness that life in the land is gone from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the womb's belly for about 9 months, and that it can be more easily used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth until the first swim just two weeks will pass.
"That's too little time to forget something," says baby-swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child the weightlessness is thus a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles return enormously quickly and thus decreases the ability to express the child.
Well, let's take care of this by ailing introductory tools.
For example, birth could also take place in a special chamber to express the child.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling grounded, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a stress suit in the orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is fundamental to his life.
"This experiment we undertake together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled person into the world of a completely inappropriate person," says the director of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
At some point, however, it becomes reality when the earth’s inhabitants in their spaceships break up into a distant planet that will be home to their offspring born in space.
NKÚ head: Black system control failed due to political indebtedness
In the context of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good supervisory authorities and appropriate laws, but they are not applicable.
In conversation for Aktuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Neukvyší controllní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala says.
"A law is never perfect, but it has to be applied properly - and I think this is not the case with us," Kala comments.
A similar result seems to also come from joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example, he points to the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "Black System".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now banned or permitted?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the President of the Government, and the Supervisory Office, whose duty is to hinder the control of compliance with the law, in its activity," Kala states.
At the meeting of the Parliamentary Control Committee, you discussed a joint Czech-German project which compared the laws of both countries with regard to public contracts.
What was that about?
This is a parallel examination which we started about two years ago.
In simple terms, it is about the European legislative determination of how public procurement is to be handled and the national legislation is based on it, and finally there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this with each other, and although the examination is not yet complete, we have been able to identify extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even a little more "harder and perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules over and over again. One also has to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results from this project?
Such joint control could help to stop us constantly striving to perfect the laws and reduce and trigger threshold values if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economy means buying one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But reducing thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
It may even be so that we only charge the system with excessive "paperwork" in this way, and those looking for gaps in the system have much easier to use the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They are talking about the problems of the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here to our NKU, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart is the NKÚ of the Bundeskontellungshof, which is similar to ours and also has a college which is formed only slightly differently. However, in principle both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also to a certain extent comparable, but Germany is a state, i.e. that there are also those accounting agencies in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The BRH is only allowed to control federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the national accounting agencies.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would hardly compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often described as an example in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is that perhaps because the examiners are better there?
That is certainly not the case, but as I have said, I do not particularly like such comparisons.
To this end, it should be noted that those countries that are an example for us also face problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have a cooperation with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what was the significance for your authority of the amendment of the contract law, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this novelle is only a short time in force, it has not yet been affected by our tests.
As our checks take place subsequently, we have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we are more affected by the preparation of future controls - we have introduced the new control instrument "recognition of risks of uneconomicity" and examined and analysed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here, of course, the changes will have an impact, since the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tender have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positively, or will the system be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and hope that this adoption will be confirmed.
The problem may arise, however, that the rules are "harder" and cannot be complied with.
Under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination are accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) that any non-compliance with the award law is equivalent to a violation of budgetary discipline.
But then it makes sense to make the law even more strict?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out of here?
Let's start by saying which path is not targeted.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not clarify the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what does that mean?
Is the black system now banned or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the President of the Government, and the Supervisory Office, whose duty is to prevent the control of compliance with the law, from doing so.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the matter", but he can't say that we do as if nothing were.
The contract law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions - and this is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder is excluded with the best offer only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly applied - and that is what I think is lacking.
On the streets there are isolated ice smoothness, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there is partly snow and ice smoothness.
However, the roads are predominantly well-performing, sometimes increased caution is recommended.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the streets were well accessible this morning, and snow and ice smoothness prevail.
Temperatures decreased to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should become somewhat warmer.
In the region it does not snow anymore, and in the deeper altitudes remains only a thin snow cover.
However, there are about 30 cm of snow on the trunks of the Erzgebirge.
According to the District Street Guard, there was a limited view of fog.
The highway R6 and the roads of the first class of roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention should be paid, for example, to bridges on which the lanes are sometimes required and smooth.
It is also possible to drive all routes of the second and third road classes, including mountain roads.
On these roads, however, snow remains in some cases required or out of the way.
In particular, increased attention is therefore needed in higher levels.
Districts of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads Ostböhmens there is danger because of ice smoothness, in higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes still an outcast snow layer on the streets, the road and highway management informs on their websites.
The road champions warn riders of ice smoothness, which can occur particularly in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
Eisglätte can be found especially on roads of the second and third class roads in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is located in particular on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické mountain range.
An elusive snow layer is situated on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia it is mostly sunny or cheerful today, and it remains largely non-slip.
Temperatures are moving between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen District
Roads in the Pilsen district are now well accessible, but local attention is needed, and driving is adapted to the weather.
This is freezing in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it had snowed before and the temperatures then fell, it can come to ice smooth on the streets.
Locally, it is also necessary to expect fog, but the view will improve over the day.
These data are from the district road masteries.
The D5 motorway is virtually fully accessible, but increased attention recommends the road masters between the 80th and 131th kilometers.
The first class of roads are mainly dry but frozen.
In the south of the Pilsen and Tachov circles, however, ice smoothness may occur in part.
The journeys of the second and third categories of roads are wet, and therefore the reference to possible required sections is also valid here.
Drivers should be particularly careful about the less frequent roads in the Böhmerwald area.
Olomouc District
Today, snowmatch is a must for drivers who travel towards the altitudes in the district of Olomouc.
After the use of scattered vehicles, snow mats remain on the pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
After night snow driving forced the road masters to use, in the Šumperk district, according to information from the road administration about 3 cm of fresh snow fell.
In the other areas of the district, the railways are usually fully accessible.
"In the Šumperk district, snow remains in the altitudes.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to count on snowmatsch towards Jeseník," said a member of the Šumperk road administration today opposite the ČTK agency.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to go out at night, according to their information, the roads are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are fully accessible, but in the district of Šternberk the drivers have to drive cautiously in forest sections, as the lanes are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem District Liberec
In North Bohemia, the road champions report several bad road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice smoothness, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is blocked in the district of Ústí N.K. according to information from the traffic police.
The temperatures remain below zero even in deeper locations, so that snow and ice will keep on the streets. However, no problems are reported from the low plains, especially southeast of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported until now.
Eisglätte is reported in particular from the district of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, in the night sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes and from road I/13 at the border of the districts of Ústí n.L. and Liberec.
The blockage of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to branches that were pushed from the snowy load to the roadway.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think should take place in less than a month of world fall?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people are so happy to jump on.
With our band The Tap Tap, we make more fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world who can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the downfall.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world’s fall.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It is a national benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this purpose, we want to use the Mayan calendar marketing potential, which is forecast for the end of December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
On the day before that, i.e. on December 20th, three concerts will take place at the same time in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts should be in about the time when the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone of 12 hours ahead of us.
From whom does this idea come from?
Originally from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the downfall of the world, but we would also like to think together with the public about the state in which we hand over this world to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key tags against the world downfall, with which the people can also support us via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, also recorded the so-called anthem against the downfall of the world with the title "World Fallout Out".
Already today, the Hymne on YouTube is very popular. Will it also sound on the benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, provided that everything works and that the world is not going to happen...
The anthem is to be sung by all interpreters at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the anthems are transmitted live together in a direct circuit from the Czech television.
The text of the Hymne comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you get to work with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many benefits events and concerts...
We are working hard to integrate these people into our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in cooperation with us and have fun with it.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the downfall of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free training center Studeo, where we have been working for six years together with the Association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the readers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a building of our own is to be built, in which we move with this project.
At each concert several groups and performers appear.
What criteria did you choose?
We wanted to put together a program that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Lesbiens support, Illustrosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý occur.
Find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time in the spring of Prague, and also for this concert we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to appear at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we were in the USA - would also like to combine this with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not just small, so you have already taken place in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it appears at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room. Furthermore, of course, we must carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, so far it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that sometimes I have wondered myself already.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were witnesses in Russia just of the fact that everything is in its beginnings in the East.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not disabled. There it is still unusual when someone in the wheelchair is travelling alone in the city centre.
It is not even natural there that you leave a wheelchair driver in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways do we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many other things we're hanging after...
However, it should be noted that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public space, go to the museum, use toilets etc.
But it is not common for a larger group of disabled people to participate actively in social events, in which we are a little ahead of the band The Tap Tap to the West!
Respect for the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years ago, what motivated you to create a band in 1998?
At that time, I started working as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in engaging in something more intensive.
And since I am a musician myself and I play Saxofon among others, I founded a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and in time, as our presenter, Lá, Angelovič, has been saying, this is a little out of control (laughs).
But it's only in the last few years that the band has become known or I'm wrong?
It is true that the collaboration with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also started to advertise actively for ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and you don't see it outwardly, your performance in a certain sense does not exist.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also provide good readers, high-quality devices and others.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the very beginning, I felt the potential that things could be dealt with differently.
In the show business, one often copies the other.
This makes sense in its own way, as everything new is viewed with caution and only accepted after a long time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is, of course, pity; this is only natural...
But that pity is absolutely superfluous because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, provided that they have the means necessary to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed something, this is not just a progress for them, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and you must also demand a certain discipline.
However, I believe that this is totally normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have twice a week's trial, that they have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, the enthusiasm will fail with many quickly.
This is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them were there since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Lá, a Angelovič.
We're an open group. People come and go. You can't stop that.
Whoever has the will and the desire to join in is always welcome to us.
Takes place on the day before the predicted world fall, Thursday December 20th, 2012 at 9pm
Locations include: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected to each other via live circuits and a common interpretation of the anthem "World downfalls" of the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise the funds for the provision of a multifunctional disabled educational centre that is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost point: 25 million CZK
The entrance costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available on presales at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this space authority at a ministerial meeting of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA). As a result, Poland is the second member country of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The path of Poland into space, of course, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were dealing with space, not always understanding it.
I remember here, for example, the presentation by A. Šternfeld of December 6, 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entry to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905) made the audience cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, which was founded by Robert Esnault-Peltery and André Louis Hirsch in 1934 for "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important champion of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldwide recognized contribution to space development was appreciated by one of the craters named after him on the moon's elongated side.
Already in 1925, a railway Draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for starting or braking the draisine.
The information for this purpose is exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered arteries.
The research carried out by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
The documents submitted show that research had been carried out to the stage of practical tests.
The research was, of course, interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, a photoelectric hunting rocket appeared in the specialist press of the draft of a photoelectric hunting rocket by Ing. Rohoziński, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powitrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Previous Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukovy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work it was completed from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space after the war were published in the Polish press, thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this company was made in 1954 in the November issue of Problemy magazine, which dedicated four extensive articles of space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space society.
At the time there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was to be seen that the exploration of space would have the future.
As early as 1956, the Polish space company PTA tried to join the International Space Federation, founded in 1951, and in fact, PTA became a regular member already in autumn 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), was appointed Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He had this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 the PTA has been significantly involved in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first one took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and 1959 started flight tests with the two-step missile RM-2 in the Bł the Dów desert.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe altitude winds.
In 1962, however, further development was discontinued.
The first rockets of the RM type were the Meteor-1 rockets developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the start weight was 32,5 kg.
Three types were developed from these rockets (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space with 0.4 litres of capacity, a meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and a meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight altitude was 37 km for all three types.
From 1965 to 1968, the Meteor 2 rocket was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
After that, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
The accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) was also worth mentioning in 1960, on which two years later a national COSPAR committee was set up.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second Interkosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the non-profit law is not a solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court lifted the law on non-profit work.
This decision called for a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a wider perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final effect, this means that individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with reckless financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (lones) price tensions occur.
Under this term, a state in which the manufacturer tries to survive in economic competition through the import of favourable goods by " undercutting" the competition in order to take on a larger market share and increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means, for most companies, that they move their production abroad or buy cheaply, or give up their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, there is a need to increase public expenditure.
This situation is reinforced by the fact that the gentlemen are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby replace the overall social and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population to private capital without regard to the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own population to accept the dictates of private capital in particular in the pay sector.
This is done on the one hand by economic compulsion in the case of long-term unemployment, on the other hand by cutting workers' rights on the other.
The result is growing poverty, as well as growing differences between poor and rich.
In Germany for several years there have been public food tax offices for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of persons involved is already going into the millions.
As a result of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such low wages that the state must increase their income up to the minimum of their existence.
Such a scandal was also revealed in the case of auxiliary forces employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures in practice of all EU South States will undoubtedly go beyond the same condition, in which people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) under the pressure of a disastrous fall in their social level, or to represent a hunger wage on the edge of society, hoping that someday private investment capital will flow into the country.
Here, of course, the question arises, where does this capital come from?
If it comes from another EU country, only poverty moves from one country to another; or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa, employees work at all for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns Latin America as a whole.
Liberal theories and media claim that the state cannot participate with capital in its own economy and that planning leads to economic disaster.
Private capital is very close to its view that the state must not intervene in the economy.
But then you have to ask yourself whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence of this is the existence of a practically all-powerful lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual advance, legislation, in which practically everything is corrupt, but nothing punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a Ministry of State is entrusted with the preparation of legislative drafts for lack of finance in private, closely interconnected with industry.
These draft laws will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence is no longer due to peoples as the Western Constitutions proclaim it, but to strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, liberal democracy is quickly coming into a situation as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time Caesars and Pompeius: "The state has long been in disintegration, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against lubrication money, by illegal profiling advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew unrestrained, and the people went with already bought votes for election" ... "People with character did not apply to offices, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "You really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a sole domination, and that a strong man had to be elected"... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was then Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy by the sole rule.
As it turns out, today's society, as in ancient times, is based on the reckless preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to overall social interests.
By its very nature, private capital is not able to recognize and enforce the advantage for the entire society.
The result, today as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of elites, who do not strive in the least for deeper reforms.
The cause for the emergence of fascism and Communism must therefore be sought in the reckless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Faced with today's state, the decline of these regimes in favour of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain break in which the next round is already taking place.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today's elites face the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are witnesses today, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the older and newer history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the non-profit law is not a solution here, at least not a lasting one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore essential to the system.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the capital participation of the state in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Labor of Chaos.
"...that nothing comes of violence or ever could arise" sings Sting in Fragile, whose most important verse in the Refrain: "...that we may not forget how fragile we are" .
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be anyone," says the dying Good Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
One is behind Israel and argues with its right to self-defense, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed by the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State of Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is guilty and victimized in these ever-returning waves of killing; ultimately, the inhabitants of Israel, including self-government, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence itself.
It is my concern to open the audience's eyes behind the scenes, looking at whom the 95 years of tension (as calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) are especially useful in the small spot country in the Middle East.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts; others are derived from them and come from my own understanding of who or which group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make up a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question whether it really was always those personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or were behind their throne someone who guided their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must acknowledge that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world focuses less on individuals in hand, and that this concentration of money and the power resulting from it did not arise within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is a special one that can be described as the head of the collar (I do not know if anyone else stands above them, but I do not exclude it) - the Rothschilds.
Much is not written about them.
It's understandable.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds in the 1990s to prevent the connection of its name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which always stood the consolidation of their power, the increase of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they lead or equip themselves on wars (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the invasion on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Ghaddafis remained only four, with Russia in the meantime substituting its central bank of the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay for it with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as the central bank, began to release his own banknotes during the civil war and was murdered in 1865 in a theatre.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; Mr. Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936, after he wanted to sue the FED for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the global castle of power of the Rothschild led to the formulation of a plan for the fettering of three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating Europe's great monarchies, and the second war was to break the colonial rule of Britain, and the third war was to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (a number of them would provide for their comforts and luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (the ecumenicalism here is nothing more than the premise) and ultimately lead to the takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chaos - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the FED, so that crises such as those caused by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they succeeded in triggering the First World War by killing the Habsburg throne successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian tsar kingdom through the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian tsar empire), then the resolution of the great power of Austria-Hungary Central Europe.
In order to facilitate World War II, the bankers created a latent conflict situation through politics by occupying Germany with huge war repairs; thereby creating the condition of impoverished masses, so that they had to subject only a sufficiently strong leader to the Germans who had named the debtors and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-people state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority who should take the function of a fifth column and also took it in order to incite the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was the first conflict with the native Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was losing himself from the chain at which the international bankers held him at first, or whether everything went according to plan, it was hard to estimate, in any case the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as was the ground for the Second World War due to the war reparations against Germany, the proclamation of the state of Israel represents the focus of the Third World War.
If international bankers are able to defuse this war, the Jewish people will become a victim in the front line of battle, as in the Second World War, together with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the land itself, but also internationally (you only think of how keenly people divide themselves into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty person and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only results in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power at the beginning?
One must distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel as well as with us, the people, are exclusively their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fascism-like politician who is loyal to the international bankers, who is doing everything possible to bring about a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly widen into a global conflict, and in which, because of Iran's control over the only 2-mile-wide road from Hormus, which runs over 20% of world oil supplies, could result in a destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller from 1994: "The only thing we need is an all-rounding crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their imagination, the new world order is a world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn at birth is implanted a chip to submit this being of total control.
"And it makes the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give a sign to their right hand or to their foreheads, that no one can buy or sell, because he has the sign of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom; he that hath understanding shall consider the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamic students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they called for the delivery of the crashed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the USA after the revolution, who for decades had kept the Patronate over his regime.
For the American government, there was no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have caused massive damage to the confidence of her allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable to enforce the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the introduction of a theocratic regime.
It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the united states, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to free the hostages made everything even worse.
The diplomats captured were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been held by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages at home brought out a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which gave the United States a small partial victory.
Six ambassadors fled immediately prior to the occupation of the message.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring refugees from Iran, helping them to cover their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports dressed as members of a movie staff who supposedly visited film locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez also required the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the camouflage credible, articles appeared about this film project in technical journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time, based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affeck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic politician, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Husar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
In this way, mood levels change in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and even in the film version of the same situations there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly overshadowed.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA central and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the official corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in making a remarkable restart of his career with this film.
From a smiled actor has become a respectful director, and even as an actor he is no longer the goal of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the Krimi No children's play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thrill city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it's Affeck's first film that doesn't play in the home Boston of the director.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that removed the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really occurred - the entrance sequence of the message's arrogance is very impressive in its overview, yet still conveys the feeling of confusion and the uncertainty that occurs when history moves somewhere.
Afleck and his team also achieve a similar effect in fictitious scenes (the false film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
But with the few, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality - which doesn't always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is turned off by a telephone in America, or the pursuit of persecution on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its too broad distribution, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures deserve more space, and they are by far not alone in the film.
Affeck’s film loses a bit of pull. It’s a film that you can use with some interest to get rid of the design and the retro style reminiscent of a 70th-year-old thriller.
But he only wakes up a lot of enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a certainly living piece of history and as proof of how the notions of the omnipotent and all-knowing intelligence services are surpassed, he is sufficient.
Guidelines for the inflating of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually calls for a survey of the most absurd bank charges, decided this year to organise the competition "The most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This idea led us to the recent EU plan to introduce a 40% women's rate in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who is concerned with the organisation of this survey, to the newspaper Právo.
Among the above mentioned absurdities is the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the uniformization of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women benefited from life insurance because they are objectively less risky to insurance companies.
"More incredible incidents from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013", said Nacher.
The controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the binding fencing of bioethanol to fuels which, as a result, are harmful to nature, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which became much more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism also reaped the actual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or also the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU Apparat often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose claims are generally represented in Brussels by one or more member countries (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with veto threats).
Lobby interests also found that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have "circumcision anomaly".
In doing so, the European Commission defended the argument that they only harmonise the uneven national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been avoided by the EU against the resistance of some countries with the indication that the directives to date would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which according to balloons must be accompanied by the indication that children under eight years of age should not blow up the balloon without adult supervision.
The EU called for an American study which, according to balloons, is the leading cause of child suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using annual market wastes.
Curiosis There are also at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns European officials themselves - anyone who has an official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and instead must say FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated the EU regulation on the scope of food supplies in the field of a member country in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economics Laissez Faire.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food supplies that could be found on the day of our EU accession to the Czech Republic.
For example, the Czech Republic exceeded the fixed volume for mushroom canned, which threatened us with a high fine.
The survey organizers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or about the idea of giving funding for applications for funding funds.
These ideas, of course, were not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply for reimbursement from the EU," said Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) Minister of Agriculture in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the cereal harvest had been very high and that the state warehouses were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has another way to sea ports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us, according to Palas.
Finally, the European Commission has been so far in favour of the Czech Republic that it has organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries which do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which should specifically be a means for the suspension of grant applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizari Regulations are the exception
Although regulations in the Member States are easily becoming the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate, and thus also for the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole, some experts are more worthy of recognition.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects which have nothing at all to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced into the budgetary negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions in this country also emphasize the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
After a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the term "Olomoucké tvarůžky", the National Center (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename "Tuzemák".
The name Rum may only be used for sugar cane distillate products, not for sugar beet products.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the world-famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, Lübeck Marzipan or Parmashink now also show the Karlsbader Zweiback, carp from Pohořelice and Třebo, or Saazer Hopfen.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer Lebkochen or the Hořic rollers can brag.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr Senator, how do you get the idea to run for President's office?
I'm not talking about being a Senator or president.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I wouldn't run anywhere.
But I can no longer look at how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves run around freely, while people are increasing taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions of becoming a politician.
But if I see something that I don't like, I try to suggest a solution to change this.
And since I am already over 40, and independent and impartial, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a Senator or the President.
In the Senate you did it and then immediately made your way to the castle.
Don't you thereby turn your voters' back?
I've been telling myself all the time that I'm going to take up the fight for the castle after the Senate elections.
Later on, I specified this and said that I would run for President's office if I was elected Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not just that we, as a people, are blaming in the pub and in front of the television, but bring down everyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media, who want to rob them of honor, and who confuse the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have taken up the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive statements of assets over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no competences in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring in legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I set out to keep the guide a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-spirited policy - if anyone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent party, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that without a drawer thinking and party dogma, I can take from each party what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a human being in politics rather to the right or to the left?
From a Czech point of view, people seem to see me on the left.
For me, this right-right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
For me, it's important that we keep moving.
I don't care if anyone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect the people.
I always publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You're wrong if someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to get closer to this.
In my opinion, this can be described as populism, but all the proposals I have spoken about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you will only remain a key issue.
And with this, you do not get far in the long term in politics.
Or do you think that if you talk to the people for a long time, will you succeed, for example, in asserting material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other way.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to lay down the legal framework for substantive and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And if necessary, the English would have to say why they reject it.
A strong personality that points to abuses can exert pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the President who was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started politics and tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I alone do not achieve anything, so I talked to several well-known personalities about whether they don't want to run for the Senate as well.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who, however, refused because of work overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorenzová, who exposed the fraud in the trade of light fuel oil.
My candidacy began with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not sure.
Sixty percent of the voters did not go to the elections at all, and those who went have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district officials.
Do you think about the formation of a party?
I have not yet thought about this because I have no time to review the past of any potential party member, nor have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account only 20,000 CZK are.
You don't have any money?
You speak of statements of wealth, how do you look?
I estimate my private assets to about CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb that is worth about one million. And then I have a few more million on the account.
By the way, Aston Martin was a children's dream - James Bond always liked me, as he was driving in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and don't have any money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but your own money you don't want to invest in it.
That's not just convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do you want me to make debts?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't arouse too much interest.
And I'm not obliged to challenge the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on the senator's salary alone; for example, I could not finance the English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If only I wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur in order to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going back to these activities?
But that doesn't depend on the amount of the salary.
As promised, I have partly driven back my activities.
For example, my alternate will be the managing director of the travel agency in spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still the case.
However, as President, I would completely cease my business.
The full discussion can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of nails and the recently built bookshop - 2 photos
"I like the building, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passantin on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large-scale business, says, "But, it's beautiful, the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library for today.
All have internet, iPad and e-books.
No human beings still voluntarily go into one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenis, a barely needy sleeping town in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000 inhabitants community has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision was made to contribute to general education and to rebuild the seven fictitious bridges on the euro notes as prettyly paved steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master statistics: a library had to be here!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam's architecture office MVRDV, master of the great bold bar charts and producer of funny and often cynical buildings, took the matter with familiar serenity and appeared to the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grinsen in the face.
And while the jury was still looking around and tapping with the axles, the freaky Maas stacked up his refined mixture of size to a pyramid and ended his actionistly supported speech with the words: "Dear town community!"
So that's him, my proposal for the bookshop of Spieljenis, for the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million Euro expensive mountain is shaken up.
It is part of a revitalisation project, which includes underground car park, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the bookshop was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the sightless small city resorts, which until now had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stateless ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all, spijkenis now has the first public culture in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to Book
The first impression: bookeldorado under cheese bell.
Although there is a lift that leads through the mountain massif, the true joys of space and reading open up in walking up the topography.
The completely glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street lanterns speak the language of a public square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You already look forward to park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the book shelves stand along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark space, which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic room configuration on our head and built the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the bookshop is cleverly used: in the center are offices, internet libraries, chess club, environmental center and home technology center.
A special joy are the black bookshelfs, which are sometimes wall paneling, sometimes brushing, sometimes Stiegengeländer.
Optics, haptic and smell are strange.
Even inflamed architects and civil engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenissen, on request of the standard.
And so, one day, in a foreign agricultural holding, we have hit a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands, in greenhouses and in fields a millimeter thin plastic sheet has been used as a root cover.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds, two seasons, after that it is ripe for the bulk.
For the library, the nonwovens were pressed into four centimetres thick plates for the first time in these quantities.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) paints itself into a dark, homogeneous, durable material that smells a bit of new cars and a bissl after a sports shoe.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500-metre hike, the Literaturcafé is not only rewarded with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch crooks and potted ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all they ensure the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donating for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house, despite the many glass surfaces, is a demonstration project in punctto ecology," says Trouborst.
Immersed and cooled with earth heat.
Although the bookshop is under a fall of glass, even on sunny days the sun appears only briefly inside.
The wide wooden cylinders, which stand across to the glass facade, serve as a scalding and catch a large part of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
All the rest are fully automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who describes the Buchenberg as "long-overdue soul".
The reason: For opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
This is the first time that the optical gaps in the library, which is not yet fully stocked - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept has gone up.
The shelves are filled up.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just a garter.
As a result, MVRDV has succeeded in the royal discipline that is called in the professionaljargon identity foundation.
Spices have written literary history.
So young and uneducated she may be.
This is finally an approach to identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert in US-European relations, Berlin thus balances on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians to the United Nations.
But then Berlin contained itself.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, because of his special relationship with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I think it doesn't support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about setting up a flight ban zone.
It was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to have a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is precisely changing its foreign policy, away from a policy managed by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
It is difficult to say that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans thus find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still touching their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or the UK.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to refer to positions which are independent of those of the USA or European partners in the case of national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany needs to protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the attitude of the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to push the public, but also the elites, into the Arab countries.
It certainly plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to give it too much weight either, that's not a totally one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany damage its relations with the USA by abstaining from important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I believe that there is great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the USA.
That's why I don't think this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps it will even show some respect for Germany.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be considered.
There are various opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The U.S., on the other hand, clearly voted for a veto.
Are there differences between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I think that the Obama government is secretly very much aware of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always appear.
If you look at the relationships between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so excited about Netanjahus politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not at present the case.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and instead have to push things forward from their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
It's always been a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany itself see itself as an important international player - does Germany even want to play a leading role?
Or does Germany still find the leading role difficult?
Germany is not yet used to it, that is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes on a greater role, various anti-German feelings are released.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
This is how Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be responsive to different neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now the US's influence in European policy is constantly decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else remains there?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and it's much more unlovable - c'est la vie!

"Markenschutz" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, and Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind it is an officially registered name in China, which, however, has nothing to do with the origin companies.
Nevertheless, it enjoys as long as protection as the real names do not complain.
And even then, it's not clear if they get justice.
"It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specialises in defence infringements in Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
The imitators already have a few additional letters to allow them to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can enter Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, for example, the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the brand office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zena DF Puma protected, an art name that also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zena.
The fact that the Chinese world champions are in copying and in the injured intellectual property is known.
In the big cities there are multistorey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: On behalf of his clients, it is against the fact that Chinese companies are officially granted the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who attract rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is harmful to business, you have to fight it," Pattloch asks.
"The brand is watered down, the single position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the costs of the sectors concerned are included in the millions, especially in the case of expensive show products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year is the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing.
However, deletions of dubios entries in the brand register are difficult to reach and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can go with uncertain results.
Pattloch reports on cases where the court dismissed actions because after the long duration of the disputed name had become a "market reality".
If the defendant has bad luck, he even had to pay the plagiar because he violated his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal argument with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against Nachahmer from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there have been bottlenecks in 2010 due to too little staff and space equipment.
Last year, however, we returned to normality from "the need for work".
Thus, the existence of unprocessed opposition proceedings had fallen by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases had been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 appeals are still waiting for execution in the office.
On the other hand, it costs a lot.
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received over 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record, and it means that for the tenth time in a row China has the list of new applications worldwide, the Authority shall notify.
This also applied to the existence of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan had been charged.
This means that each application costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, it costs a lot, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the Group has been fighting a Chinese plagiar.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that their illegal manufacturing of imitated parts of the vehicle was removed.
However, the imitator continued to secure Chinese rights in the Freudenberg brand.
You yourself have failed to do so, since surnames could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO rejected the opposition of the Munichers.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg got right, but the trial opponent continues to fight.
You have to be careful about it.
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be explained that the company archive had to look through even a hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite party in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
"Then you can see how much it is worth us," says Wentzler.
The dangers of Fernost even threaten to swam back to Europe.
Then, when imitators secure unprotected brands there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The company has long ceased this business, but it was still able to cancel registration.
"You have to watch closely," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international brand rights, but rather, foreigners should register "everything that is somehow worth protecting also in China", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg is in the last act of his brand drama, then you probably would have to pay the opposite side license fees for your own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Day: Stamps, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland, Aidswisen is looking forward to it.
The story of a connection that is far more than 8733 kilometres above.
At first, there is the stamp: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's puppies and men's slippers looking for the clock on the parquet floor, find him quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then did the voices of the singers slowly wave - old, bass, tenor and soprano - distress, deceive and persecute themselves.
And fites Hopph, the 29-year-old conductor, takes it almost out of his shoes, when he brings them together with his mildly wild gestures.
It's Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, Chor Imbongi tries a new song.
The fifty singers came from 23 to 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choral voice has another text and it is also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
There are around 34 million HIV infected worldwide, which is estimated to be Unaids, the United Nations Programme for the Fighting of AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
245,000 Indians live in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa Paten has found in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take on a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school allowance, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means on Zulu storytellers or praisers.
The Bantu language fluently cannot speak in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally brings them back where they originally came from: in the South of Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometres of airline from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, because they're on the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, the small one, the whole of Swaziland is sick: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland carry the immune weakness virus in themselves, dying with the middle of thirty is no rarity.
On a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school degree, there is no chance in a poor country.
In the beginning, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and give him a warm meal a day.
But already a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has been almost professionally caring for the Aids-Waisen in Esitjeni.
Facts of sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (Gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papilomavir, herpes genitalis, or hepatitis.
STI is one of the parasitic STI.
Who are the main stakeholders?
Symilis and Trippers occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In the heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidosis (pilz), trippers and human papilomavirs are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively low - yet, around 20 percent of the HIV new infections are due to this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common in adolescents than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections concern young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
Human pappilomaviruses are also common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 diseases, the number of syphilis infections more than doubled in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urination symptoms, outflows, subtly pain, and bladders or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide a hundred percent protection.
In part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubrication infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed, most STI can be cured and late episodes avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the gallows of the choir all over Germany come together.
"To sum, we have already sent around EUR 200 000 to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and persuasive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also cares for the orphans to be well accommodated, for example, by one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women on Zulu are called, are the supportes of the village.
Some of them have taken up up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads, and ensure that the children appear to teach school on time each day in their uniforms.
Anyone who has no one else comes to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as well as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chicken houses and jointly organized PSI with the American health organization that many in the village have made an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because so obviously the disease throughout the country is also, one prefers to keep it dead.
A King With 14 Wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this stately sanctioned life form that the HI virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms would be at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - bottleh to bottleh."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels all two, three years together through the South of Africa and sings songs full of weed, combat spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, many of which still know on the southern tip of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already cast off some gruesome border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if you find the small village on maps hardly, it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Going to Esitjeni, there's the light," people there say.
And if you return the 8733 km airline to Heidelberg, to the pounding singers in the test room on Bergheimer Straße, then you can see it there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the Mercury
The probe messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice blanket may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space authority NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is next to the sun, there are frozen water there, as results from three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science".
The probe messenger has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that were hit on the Mercury.
No one, however, links the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the messenger son Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have come to other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the earth's citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send pictures to earth: Small holes in infinite surroundings.
The picture comes from a camera that German researchers have developed from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, also the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who circles around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" after the new definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This picture section of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of uncounted star generations: The oldest stars are to be seen as blue points, more difficult to identify are the pink-colored "neighbors" in the Star Circle Hall.
This star-forming region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light-years.
This dazzling gluten of a dying star has taken the tipper telescope of the Nasa.
The Donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star slid out in the dying process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5400 light years away from the earth, gas and dust create new stars.
The Spitzer telescope of the Nasa shot this photo of the galactic birth tube.
The Pleiaden cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colours are better applicable.
Like a red algae, the Helix Nebula looks at the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius constellation.
His similarity with an earthly continent brought this fog the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be absorbed in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How these were created is one of the great puzzles of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn month that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest shots of the Hubble telescope: The Hot tub galaxy
Depending on the color scheme, recordings of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The recording published by the European Southern Observatory shows the trifid nebula in the constellation Schütte, which has been removed for several thousand light years.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three divided, three divided), as dark strips divide the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation snake carriers have photographed the precursors of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light years away from the earth, the cores of two melting galaxies rush to each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
To whom technical abbreviations do not lie, it may call them by its nickname Southern Fire Wheel.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows a cut out of the Irisnebel in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light years removed fog consists of dust grains, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary home dust.
This image was composed of optical and x-ray recordings of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded the space telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy is called scientists UGC 1810.
The brightest group of young stars on our Milky Way is located in this star nebula.
The starbird always produces new youngster.
This star cloud, combined with the rosette nebula, is constantly producing new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers assume that it was not until shortly after the Big Bang when the universe was primarily hydrogen found.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei made it a year later for star observation.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have been getting bigger and deeper - and the insights they provide are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope stands.
It allows looking into all immediately over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Islands of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes at 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of the favourable design: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
Its speciality: the high light collectivity.
This, in spite of relatively low mirror diameter, is enough for the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to space according to alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
For the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope - which makes his name all honour.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can also highlight the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is to include a lot of 42 meters - and be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, pictures can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes were considered the largest in the world on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which looks into the sky next to them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
It is here to marvel at an illustration.
The most important impressions from space, however, are provided by the space telescope Hubble.
Since 24 April 1990 it has already delivered pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, space telescope Kepler has been looking for extrasolar planets - mainly for those inhabitable.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates had been identified since mission began.
In the picture, the final start preparations on the Kepler Space Telescope are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot in space at the earliest in 2018 on board an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that there is also the South Pole of Mercury Ice.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the messenger is far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have for decades indicated that there is ice on the Mercury.
Through the messenger probe, which was launched in 2004, the first to circle the Mercury, the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter daily - and become 168 years of age
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach Bible age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach Bible age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is to be called wild-dromantic.
The small bus rumbles over the winding road, past densely forested hills, tearing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysian, which is not very well known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Assyrian and is very durable.
End station is Lerik.
The small town is protruding with too thickly guessed architecture from Soviet times, which doesn't even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the journey from Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours, because the road is only one trace.
The legendary wealth the land owes its oil in the Caspian Sea has not arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that lerik has the stuff for tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision song festival - and next year we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Museum of Long Life, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen talys from the area, older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather. He was 120 years old.
One child was born at the age of 136
However, controversial star of the museum is the sheep's herd .irali Müslümov, who is to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, Müslümov's age appears to be extremely dubious.
"1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died," Fatulayeva explains.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he should have been bearing witness to a daughter.
So at his age, did , uh, ,irali Müslümov pay off for a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard about the high-schools in Central Asia.
"A lot of high-end people are also present in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "and so many very old men are also living in Sardinia."
However, due to lack of documentation, no scientific evidence of age was required, especially since the register of persons was missing.
Every day beechically melted butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around the leik region often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
So why do so many high-school people live here in the south?
The Assyrian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysian.
Museum director Fatulayeva believes that it is the diet.
But that the calorie-rich food of the talys should be so healthy, the meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of molten butter daily, does not seem plausible from the scientific point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that people keep young? In Cëmiran, a tiny settlement not far from the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At 97 years, it is relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel that untiringly rolls her back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two small children also jump around.
In the kitchen you can prepare the guests tea served in the typical Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly located in reef and limb, under her head cloth she conceals long dark blond zuppets that proudly reveal her son before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out of me and kept their color.
"I never used Shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I haven't bought food for a single time in the supermarket for my whole life.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the period after the Second World War.
But everything became better than the "Beloved Father" Heydar Aliyew took over the row.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows hardly any boundaries in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the row.
After all, there is no need under Azerbaijan's old.
230 Manat (about the same sum in euros), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for these circumstances an amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayevas has long since been a cheerful son: "The old people enjoy respect for our culture."
They live in the midst of the large family, are loved, cared for, and are happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rivalizing rallies in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as a basis is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare with Pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but especially to the Christian Copts, Liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
For they all, so far hopelessly trampled into a confound opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a State of God on the Nile of graces of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
According to Muhammad Mursi, he almost apologised, temporarily cut the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer who carries a doctoral degree from the American University of Southern California really wants to save about it is the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear.
Do you want the judicial to be taken away?
In fact, the 234 articles of the 100-member Constitutional Assembly, dominated by Islamistly, are partly alarming in a nightly 15-hour parforce ride.
As in previous constitutions, it is stated in the draft that the case law is based on "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is an interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the malignant formulation and the resulting legal scope for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
This suggests at least a newly added article: In all the matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ahazhar University had to be advised, the country's most important Islamic institution with great radiance in all Sunni Islam.
This does not have to, but it can mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which de facto would result in the decommissioning of the judicial.
Much in the draft draft interpretation is
Also problematic: Civil Military Justice should continue to be maintained.
These courts served as Mubarak's rule to suppress opposition.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, it says in the draft, protect the true being of the Egyptian family "and promote their morals and values".
This is legally so unsightly formulated that, with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In the plain text, this means nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly defines equality between men and women.
For this another forbids to insult or slander the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult, and how it is to be worshiped, remains unclear.
Also dubios suggests the wording that "injury of people" is prohibited.
Is there already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
The question of interpretation, as so much as in the draft, which Mursi is for signature and according to his words "very soon" the Egyptians will be presented to the referendum.
"The Revolution has returned"
The opposition has been against the Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual agreement on Friday evening at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and praised to bring the Charter down before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed in the presidential elections.
Peace Nobel laureates and ex-Manager of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the draft constitution was "in the Müllberg der Geschichte".
Through short news service Twitter, he visited the followers of Mursis to want to lead a "putsch against democracy".
"When he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said the oppositional Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been reviled," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, was a demonstration of the area, but not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafis took part in this and cried: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Mursi: "Purkey the land!" and said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything began, would have been advocating civil war-like states.
That obviously didn't mean to risk Mursis followers.
The Muslim brothers declared that both the opponents of the draft Constitution and the advocates had expressed themselves loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide on the electoral stage in which direction the country should go.
A majority of the Islamists' draft is considered to be safe.
The word human rights does not even occur
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this forced constitutional process, which was supposed to go until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organisation (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their world view but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For that he was beaten, sentenced, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "world on Sunday".
Mursi's expansion of power to all three powers in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of play and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto outlawed them," Saeda laments.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, who looks at the ideological trend struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be a matter of revenge.
A protester on the Tahrr warns: "You're producing a monster that you can't control any more."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the worst fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - not only in Europe but all over the world.
Could the country's success secret have something to do with the local appetite on rather bad fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
They are placed in the midst of a bunch of dirty, humid sportswear.
And call her there for a week.
So about you have to imagine the nasal debilitating smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Ceres, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes here - and this persistent smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is salt - sprinkled trout that is fermented into water - depending on how stinking one would like to have his fish.
When in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Ceres, which is dedicated to this, now, really very charming speciality.
"You eat it raw and then wash it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fireguard, but as a so-called "rakfisk general" the festival also organizes.
Around us people consume small fish cubes and take to themselves large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
Spirit can dissipate the smell.
I'll cost you some chickens.
If you avoid getting the Rakfisk close to the nose, it's not bad - like Sushi, who has a very long bus ride behind him.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian epoch, when there were no cooling facilities and fish was tainted in airtight salt water barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter he was then taken out after long fermentation and consumed - no doubt with alcohol-dumped senses.
Even before a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and mainly moved to the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was not yet far more rich than Norway, streamed immigrants.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important - an essential, though strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy yourself here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway does not often make it into the world press, and most people do not seem to disturb it.
Here it is still hated to mention Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, we refer only to the "event of 22 July".
Norwegers have a hard time accepting that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway has been the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round tablets with mature rakfisk and embodys the Nordic ideal with her long blond hair and the stinging blue eyes.
We are - as we say - careful people.
Your English is just like most people here.
We're not very provocative, we don't like bragging.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry's income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the world economic crisis, when all the money they didn't even own, Norway kept its wallet locked.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat Rakfisk," she adds with carefree laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - from Rakfisk I have enough.
Such an elk burger is definitely something else.
But in the evening, the skunk fish is back on the menu.
The hotel I'm staying in is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - sense of smell.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-dressed showmaster surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You're laughing.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the heavy darkness of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nito is facing a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nito is preparing for his official arrival, Will Grant of the BBC analyses the upcoming challenges and the mixed feelings of his people.
At present, traffic in Mexico City is very bad.
Even on better days, this is an always clumsy city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which shuts down several important transport routes to the capital and provides chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disturb Pendler on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nito will receive the presidential union and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a complex task.
Under the divorcing government Felipe Calderons Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has cost 60,000 lives in the past six years.
"My government strongly committed itself to reducing violence," said Pena Nito in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week, US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. president, Pena Nicho was the governor of his home country of Mexico.
In this densely populated, extensive part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions are shared over the new head of state.
A direct man.
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
Residents of the resort have attributed him to the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can ride on one of the highways that Pena Nito built and which represents a great improvement over the rough, hollow roads that once existed here.
Platettes with their name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and ongoing changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congress member for the Pena Nitos party, the PRI.
In particular, as regards security and economics, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congress member Olvera admits that after 12 years outside of the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party has great expectations of Enrique Pena Nito.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president fail in substance, he refuses.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other hand, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway transfers and represents in many ways a suburbs of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of decisive urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was deployed to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot of Brachland near a large garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind in the last two years alone.
During the term of Governor Pena Nicho, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that surpasses even that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and murders of innocent women.
Critic Pena Nichos believes that he has at least not addressed the problem of women's murder during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the coming down quarter, Irinea Buendia fights with tears when she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her companion.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body arrest had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is attached next to a cross that carries a single word: justice.
But this is exactly what the family says they have been denied her until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a chatter, a troublemaker, noordinary.
They want you to just accept their verdict and keep your mouth shut.
"But this is not possible if there are so many formal errors and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the President's binding on Saturday, he will take on a great deal of responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected over the last six years by violent crimes, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope that as President he is the way he was governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
The prosecutor's office claims that Bradley Manning didn't complain about abuse
The prosecution objected to Bradley Manning's allegations that he had been abused in prison.
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks a rejection of the charge due to harsh detention conditions
Freed the U.S. Army is accused of missing thousands of confidential documents
The prosecutor's office tried on Friday to find that the army-free Bradley Manning - charged for the greatest disclosure of confidential information of American history - failed to complain of the abuse he was alleged to have suffered in military custody.
During a cross-examination in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden explained that documents on weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month detention period in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain any complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a defense request to reject the charge - Manning had already been punished sufficiently by the harsh detention period - Manning had declared that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service time in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
At the Friday hearing, Fein met Manning, the forms were carried out by officials who had completed their meetings with Manning during his detention at the Quantico military prison, where he had spent from July 2010 to April 2011 under reinforced detention conditions.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When finely asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, so fine, did not contain any complaints about abuse, even though the officials asked Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they were concerned with them, but they had not been logged.
"They wrote (after discussing the concerns) "No problems," and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," says Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he had mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting had been to lower his observation status for "prevention of injuries".
The military said it gave him this restrictive status - which is one step below the risk of suicide - to his own and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning said that he was arrested and transferred to Kuwait on Thursday, where he was held close to two months before being transferred to Quantico Marine Base Prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had once become unconscious due to the heat.
Not to be allowed to know what happened to him or to the outside world has been a burden.
"My world shrunk on Camp Arafion, on this cage together," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was allowed only one mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because on the day, whether it was forbidden to sleep or just lie down.
He always had to sleep with light, which was brought from outside into his cell.
When he turned around at night and guards couldn't see his face, he was awakened to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally raised opposition to the treatment Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas military prison.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he slept naked in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners in the morning counting.
Manning had said that he had never had the opportunity to wrap himself with his ceiling during this count.
When asked on Friday, Manning stated that he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the ceiling he could have covered himself with. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had said that he was forced to sleep naked on the previous night. He had tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the covenant of his underpants or flip-flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his prison experiences and dramatically reduce his arrest rate, he should be sentenced to the military court during his trial, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning is going to confess a minor offence for guilt, while other charges, which are considered to be too extreme, are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecutor's office is expected to justify the terms of detention.
The Pentagon shall remain in its position to establish Manning in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners kept under the highest security arrangements in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the benefit of the enemy, the unlawful publication of classified information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened with a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the expatriates - they call them hard times into memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport check when inconsistencies widened within me.
Signs referred to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Ausländer").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure to which I should confess.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexican" all my life.
Ethnic fixture - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italy".
Later I decided for "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for shortcuts or strokes.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I'm not talking about a native speaker's vocabulary, nor am I going to let go of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the snake for extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nito visited the White House to meet President Obama.
The agenda included all the issues expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nicho was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. She is one reason why Mexicans today remain in Mexico with the same probability instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to establish an association with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading block in the model of the European Union.
And Pena Nicho vowed to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartel, even if he did not mention any details about it.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States fell into Mexico in 1848 and forced the leadership of the country under the proposed rifle to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official makes only the mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complaints about how the Americans are impoverishing the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma are on the war path.
And yet the biggest challenge of Mexico lies in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Would you like to talk about ressentiments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparents - was not offered a chance in Mexico and moved north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark-headed, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness is theirs.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now be living the American dream, visiting good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity may have disappeared at times, but what concerns our loyalty is not the case.
This is clearly true of the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership class do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bonds to Mexico never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves caught behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, born in Guadalajara, who was legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this bad for them.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans, whom I know, have the feeling of not belonging to either one country or another.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but none of them is rooted.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: Some Mexican leaders and parts of educational citizenship want to resume their connections to diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional ambassadors for Mexico who represent their interests in the United States.
We are going to tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and exert pressure on political leadership to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Well.
It won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, the unbridled corruption and the violence of drugs, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go there alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to grant the United States to deal with Mexico before a century and a half, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge about how their family members have not been treated for so long.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more mexican than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual debt allocations, countless buildings were laid in bulk and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza were taken near the Israeli metropolises Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be caught in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these hosts.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly patting situation could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance optimism seems to be anything but appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, the fights of this week have strengthened the hard-bodies on both sides.
The Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement, who has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, are claiming to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group itself had to bear great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are being plowed in one of the planet's most desolatest and densely populated corners, Israel has not yet succeeded in destroying Hamas.
In fact, Hamas wins in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on its side.
Turkey, a reinvigorating regional power once regarded as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken hold for the Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Joyful Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist semimond is formed around Israel - from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power, over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist figure could stand before the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most inhabitable and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has permanently changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the Laizist Despot, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on people’s views.
In future diplomatic negotiations Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot be pushed out even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, leave an opposite conclusion.
Militaryly Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, Iron Dome, has proved its worth and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel will be able to sleep calmly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is unshakable in its position. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest violence calations.
Israel has experienced well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process to a large extent.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide offenders - not least thanks to the blockages that have entered the West Bank and thus into the main part of any Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal for international law, but are constantly being expanded.
Netanyahu is well there. His Likud party has joined Avigdor Lieberman with an even more militant group in the run-up to the elections on 22 January.
Why also embroil these insidious Palestinians and leave them their own state?
If they actually had control over the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets just like their rivals in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them, if they dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to get through, but the Arab Spring could make a difference to them.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours.
A war with local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economy.
That the pragmatic President Mursi joined Barack Obama in order to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - symbolizing perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more in the long term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking wilful steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder barrel that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to reduce Hamas in Gaza will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides require an outside impulse
The correct answer is the one represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel withdraws for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire on the outside will give more influence to the implementation of this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, stop arms supplies in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
The foreign Arab nations should also make Hamas and Fatah an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama also has to contribute to moving Israel into negotiations.
During his first term of office, he failed to imagine his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house, it seems as if it had been averted.
But that is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East.
And there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for uniform cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and affected body parts on neutral green packs equal to all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colors with neutral, olive-green lids that are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and infantry and children ill with cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures once, the only difference between the packs in the brand names that are printed in identical, small letters is coming from Saturday.
Australia is thus introducing the world’s most stringent rules for tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government wants to remove young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government of studies that have shown that people who haven't started smoking at 26 are not going to start smoking with 99% probability.
"You can already see in children's young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies try to apply with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have a slight impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
So it was said that the laws would favour black market trade, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobago Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have fueled their business.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarette kits and silicone blankets has risen enormously to cover the unbearable packaging since the British American Tobago, Britain's Imperial Tobago, Philip Morris and Japan Tobago failed at the Supreme Australian Court two months ago with their challenge to laws.
Zico sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and waited for new stocks.
It's a good business for us.
According to experts, in the popularity of social media, the hook is close to the population group to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banished tobacco companies from TV advertising, forbidding them from playing as sports sponsors and forcing most traders to stop interpreting cigarettes in shops. Now tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"He who markets tobacco and only has a small area left to apply for its products does not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, health researcher at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in experience reports on brands written by "all normal people".
You have to ask yourself the question: Is this just a private person who finds so much favor with Marlboro cigarettes that she even takes up a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobago Australia says that the industry focuses instead of marketing on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries are engaged in greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has conducted discussions with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings in 2001.
They have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show up in disrepute.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"You just take a baby and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when you buy a cigarette box that prints a photo with a mouth tumor.
Frankly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill its shelves.
"I used to take an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should simply have banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said that was okay, that's it, we're going to close," he obviously added exasperated.
In a constantly electrified world it is nice to be even bored
This Thanksgiving I was unexpectedly spending five hours at the airport when our plane was out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to get some thoughts bored.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for a flight for half a day at the airport is quite annoyed - even if books, magazines and iPhones are available (and, of course, tax-free shopping).
But more and more academics and child development experts lead boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is for us - and our children - to be occasionally bored.
This will force the brain to lose itself in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us today are staring almost constantly on one screen or another, the benefits of boredom do not benefit us anymore.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I'll come back to that.
Like many people, I always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The walls of Pompeii adorn a Latin graffiti about boredom that dates back to the first century.
And then there is still the question of how we define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "willing to perform a satisfactory activity, but not be able to do this".
Boredom differs from apathy, so that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In the case of apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consisted in a "disturbation of the attention process, paired with bad mood and feeling that time is only passing slowly".
Boredom can listen to it almost as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two conditions may be related, weary people see the problem in their surroundings or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're boring, even if we just have trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German, for example: "The inactive mind: The definition of boredom under the aspect of attention", which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a band on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighbouring room that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was hardly perceptible while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the hardly heard TV said that they felt more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems focusing on them, could not find a reason for this and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
When trying to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you are performing a monotonous activity - "just as looking for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can turn away and help you not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that chamois apples and crickets, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight these, by physically keeping people more attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to skip around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a rowdy speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people are more bored than others.
To measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scale for boredom".
On the scale, there are statements like "Many things I have to do, repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more often bored than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external charms.
But, in general, teenagers are a rather tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and her parents seven to eight times a day with a Pager.
He found that 32% of the adults in school and doing homework were bored, while 23% claimed to be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know whether the percentages have risen or fallen in terms of boredom.
However, he is sure that "youth is considered to be particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their everyday life.
So back to my question of origin: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, people take extreme physical risks and fall away from gambling or drugs to relieve them - these have shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors are investigating the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been investigating the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do best.
If you're boring and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you'll be happy.
However, television can provide happiness in the short term, but it will again flee in the long term.
So anyone who reaches an iPad to his bored child can get it off of boredom. However, it has not learned to entertain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control is transferred from one situation to another".
The child not only learns to entertain himself but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we see them too critically.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable even away from constant activity and technology reviews.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we should be bored more often, but boredom is the painful, inconceivable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people in truth are just looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with when the noise is stopped."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the southeast of Colorado for a crime in court that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few fewer marijuana breaks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends on a September day were traveling by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police had found marijuana in the car, Orozco was invited for the possession of drugs and drug utensils - cavalry crimes, each with a penalty of 100 US dollars - and received a court term.
"We are treated like criminals," says Orozco.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small quantities of marijuana for self-use, the answer depends less on the law than on the location of hundreds of minor drug offences.
Hundreds of illegal offences that are taking place around marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer pursue adults for possession for more than 21 years to a small extent. This is permitted by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that they will continue to pursue existing marijuana crimes and still quote people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to hinder new, state licensed marijuana shops at the opening in their communities.
"This situation is developing so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulatory authorities in the state of Washington also scratch themselves in the head, unscrupulously.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a period until 1 December 2013.
Washington believes that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states in terms of regulation of marijuana, where the drug was legalized only for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Authority for Spirits in Washington State.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent to follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and thus also forms the endpoint of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time - for example, how to agree on the state requirement of "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with the ban on cannabis shops in the vicinity of 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and baby care facilities.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the conurbation area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his employees in Aurora, stating that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marijuana crimes in persons over 21 years of age, and that the police would not seek criminal charges for these crimes "from now on".
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban requirements for the regulation of farmers of medical marijuana and would continue to pursue drug dealers.
In Weld County in the North Colorados, District Attorney Ken Buck has a more stringent view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly in order to move consumers to withdrawal.
At present, 119 persons have to answer for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been accused of other crimes.
"Our authority has the duty to pursue infringements that were at the time of the crime," said Buck in a statement.
Reactions are even in places such as rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer shows adults for the possession of small quantities.
State attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding acquisitions.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time implementing the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexity of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state promoted a profound twilight among local officials in view of the great green experiment.
In the case of district lawyers, it was a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents defendants in court for marijuana crimes and acts as a spokesman for the national organization for reforming marijuana laws on the ground.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives persecuting people for criminal purposes that they still cannot accept legalisation," he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national examples for the legalisation of drugs.
While intercessors and government officials are preparing legal sales for an age, they are also waiting nervously for instructions from the Federal Government that will continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at federal level as a criminal offence.
Speakers of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will yield.
Despite several spectacular arrests by consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Obama's government's drug policy consultant, believes that while criminal officials will probably not enter the doors to attack smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to stifle themselves to tolerate the state-controlled marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait for the federal authorities to act.
Before the election, some local authorities approved moratoria for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, decided a six-month ban that is expected to be adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then stand in front of a big problem at federal level," said Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We aim for what the congregation has decided and not for what the State has decided.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It had always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, which I once thought for the world's greatest knowledge stamp, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcase again and brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father broke up in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I had gone because I had a problem with having commilons having sex in the neighbouring room.
Author A N Wilson slyly stated that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I did, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I was just harassed for a reason - a reason that seemed so narrower and more cruel in this alleged wave of enlightenment: My father Woodrow Wyatt, who had now died, was an important advisor Margaret Thatchers and I advocated the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, according to recent reports, a new generation of students of moderate rights suffers from similar persecution.
The organized and increasing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them called for equal rights protection last week, which benefits adults, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College state that, due to their political views, they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable".
They demand a place in the equality committee of their college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was worsened by a recently broadcast documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which represented tories as eccentric and neonazis.
This was shown by graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and produced silver-coloured suit and silver-resisted loft.
At other universities conservative students say that they are considered to be "sins for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, announced in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing link between universities.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without even getting to know us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and historical student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the appeal for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "uncomfortable". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president of Oxford Conservative Student Association, said she had observed a growing rejection of moderate right students in JCR members.
"This poses a danger to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university had voted not to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title because of cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would even have made Stalinists startle.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students meet themselves and the tutors, I received a foretaste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors did not only tolerate the ridicule of Tory students, but even gladly participated in it.
Political issues such as the mine workers strike, the privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wooded rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I should translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been taken to what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said Tutor Harry Pitt (in the meantime dead), "Please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face like cake dough, and quite hated.
"Does thatcher trailer refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students giggling.
Tears opened in my eyes.
"I suggest that in your free time they take a few French hours - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt came up with me.
I returned to my room with my hanging head.
That night, I was sitting at college alone at dinner when someone would easily kick me on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year called James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory is being coerced.
It's bad enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I tried to adjust myself later.
I insisted that I was not in agreement with Mrs. Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A student in philosophy, politics and economics who, ironically speaking, had visited Eton College as a conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared their views.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They beat each other, right?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel in front of the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever succeed in living a normal life at Oxford?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after the dark break?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay in front of me extended before my spiritual eye to a purgatory of veneration and isolation.
The only tutor to be openly recognized as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history who had his seat in my college.
He was not only hated to be a conservative, but also because he had advised Thatcher on foreign policy and had written speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him provincial and minor, and rejected him for his Marxist-Deterministic History Perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
My father told me I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed infidel.
During his time in the fortyties, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said in a small way.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my communist friends have always displayed impeccable manners.
His damp eyes were soaked.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure you're just neckling.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, including Tory-Hungarians, had yielded to the pressure and denied his convictions.
During a tutorial the following week, where another historian seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly broke up from shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a brainwashing, and called her "old troop."
The relief took only a short while.
It was my father who hit the last nail in my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press every week.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes, my choppers gave up.
When they went, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You're welcome to call me a wretched cock.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and ugliness in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Minister, but still hiding behind an undeserved call of equal rights and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian fashion maker customers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worthy of housing an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
At the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", the designer has recognized this, a magnificent retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of Haute Couture have been created by his "Maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, who could not have been written without his distinguated clientele.
Valentino always felt fascination for the sticky and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will still be seen until March 3rd, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, beginning from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, across the Princess Marie Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophy of his social ascent from the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in Northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the noodle does not have to be disadvantageal.
"At least they don't kick their chickens on your gorgeous carpet, as there are some beautiful celebrities from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all pleased when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago we went to him for dinner after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Each detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," recalls the "top model", which began their career at the week of Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obscurity, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long walkway, which suggests a role exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the runway to admire a dreamy "audience" wearing masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti carried in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to the empress Farah Diba.
In this audience from fashion dolls, names such as the names of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg shine.
Nataly Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Many of these girls say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest type "gillette" and a jacket from the fall/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I present him to everyone else because of his great love for the women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the ex-Horzog of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have plenty of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and pollinators at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time when they wore a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came along.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a feast in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped top with a decolleté that honors its name.
"It was a dream that came true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, its possession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening clothes from the fashion maker "with absolute care", because a dress is not only a dress, but also the related memories".
The "King" of Fashion
The big finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Channelal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashionmaker called his proximity) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroiderys and a four and a half meter long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialist press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the Supreme Society".
For years the elite's "savoir-être" is now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Arts et des Lettres, awarded the honorary legion, Garavani cumulates as many honors as each of the husbands of his customers.
"I have always noticed his refinery, his peace, his well-kept and perfect exterior," D'Arenberg admits.
I saw him the last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; time doesn't leave any traces of him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and their health at risk when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their lives by taking sulphur from the Kawah Ij volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to climb down to the ground of his crater every day, where the sulphur-based gas flowing from the earth is solidified in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilos, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the waste paths of stone.
Although it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano that rises up to a height of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the climb in the turtle speed, keeping the balance and taking careful steps so that they do not slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened by a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen.
The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocents for each kilo of sulphur that they degrade.
Upstairs they arrive the path between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale that a mine company has placed a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who since 1960 has exploited the deposits in the volcano and (not better said) his workers, to whom she pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for each kilo of sulphur.
This is then sold to the petrochemical industry for every 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used to produce matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for every way," explains Anto, who usually makes three routes a day.
For each route it takes three hours, after which it is completely accomplished, but at the end of the day it has 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such a very inhuman effort, but is the triple of what he would earn in field work.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid per day for the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros) is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a Maurer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not as hard, but Anto with his family returned to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and that for a reason which is as important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathed with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been playing his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left the first tracks in his life, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathed with difficulty, coughed frequently and his eyes have been irritated by toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This friendly and intelligent but life-punished young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he did the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden cottage with other carriers and gets up at two o'clock each morning, because the sulphur flows out at night, where his characteristic yellow color in the darkness shines bluishly.
Challenged by the shadow, he rises in the crater in the light of a small front lamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders at the bottom of the crater.
Despite their large profits, the mine company has not mechanised sulphur mining to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also receive no share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) supplement per camera that the guards of this natural park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) require from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
"This work is for animals and not for humans" protests Madrusin, a staggering 42-year-old carrier who has worked at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues "as long as it goes" because he needs the money for the education of his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and the eyes shake when the wind suddenly turns and the miners claps into the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course except the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on its back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg with its 53 years.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported from three trucks via a goat path between the bush to the camp in Tamansari at 18 kilometres away.
"I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life" explains Unainik, opening his mouth far away, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder, with his 30 years, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty keeps generation on generation in one of the toughest occupations in the world: those who work as a human burden on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeese blame for having no children, for the career, for the stress and costs of real estate and for child education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we fulfill our civil duty and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertising for minzbons, but - or precisely because of that - they became in Singapore at the beginning of this year a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local sayings such as "disks will be a "bao" (lab) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who has shot the video, has the hope that the commercial will reach the problem in a funny way.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their "national duty".
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in reproduction, so we noticed that this was a subject that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot of things, such as marketing perfumes with pheromons or organizing speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
It was possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Anyone who does not take this issue easily is the Singapore government.
Every year it spends $1,300 for policy measures to encourage citizens to get more children.
A government package for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, highly technological city state in southeastern Asia, which is also known for the conservativeism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2, which is also known as the replacement rate, was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeians get more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better training" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to avoid getting married and forming a family much more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single persons and to the delay of marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counter the reduction of the population led to a ressentiments among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely cashed Xenophobia blossoms against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for keeping the wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also considered one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on the economic growth of a nation that has tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It already has effects on the housing market.
The urban development authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they deter the construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This causes them to be much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new norms give the developers clearer orientations that had previously been put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Stress Too Much
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, talks with the Singaporeians working in the financial district should be taken into account that they will not have a major impact.
"People are very stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The kids can get others.
"For me it's important to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women lead their careers, the stress and the costs of ownership and education as reasons for not being able to have children.
That is why the Singaporeians have the last word when it comes to getting children - that is where the government can do so much.
The offline Private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or private life where you have the right to protection against any kind of interference.
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Is he aware of the dangers he poses when he announces in the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 who are often on the network.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very own" at a personal level and "to the password and user" when they applied it to social networks.
"I wouldn't announce my deepest secrets in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload nice pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who makes the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of nudity, of crimes, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assured to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them also the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up with Twitter to express myself and write interesting Tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I just load her up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can speak quickly to relatives in the distance or with friends" he says.
He answered that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone felt a stranger to him, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not to know 20 of the people he has added to his list of friends.
"This doesn't scare me because we have something mean, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one made any suggestions to him or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If anyone pushes me or asks me to do so, I just remove him from my user account" he admits.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy's experience is not unknown today as cyberbullying.
A friend's friend was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He just made it private."
Then he explains a number of steps to safely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, that's what I'd do if he was unsympathetic or I wanted to wipe him out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that to orient the children and young people must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; but with the appearance of these pages the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, owner of a master's degree in pedagogy at the University of Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms for explaining the phenomenon.
The Digital Natives are them, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants to teach them where we are still learning," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we require them to have a defined criterion on what may be spread, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be picky, if it is most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is to ask them questions that they are thinking about.
"To tell you they shouldn't do it, doesn't work," he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like it if you published a photo of yourself like that you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others are publishing about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission before when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Do everyone have to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to let them understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet is dealing with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and educator, commented that it is essential for parents to read through the guidelines of social networks carefully.
When they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You shouldn't speak to strangers".
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South America (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Declaration of Lima, which was previously announced and should theoretically be signed by the seven rulers present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI. Ordinary meeting of the heads of state and government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and President's Office initially announced that they would hand it over after the clause, however, explained that it would be published at some time on the Peruvian government website.
In the case of questions on the text, they indicated that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala.
Journalists' access to information about the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the announcement "Private Session, Limited Audio".
The few information circulated among journalists were received by the press speakers from some of the governments of Unasur present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press speaker.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of the participating presidents, which caused the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media who demanded more information.
After that, the Bureau of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the "Decision" of the summit, but it was the Declaration of Humala and not the official document for the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru was host to the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite strong invitation from the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was equally not published.
On the official ASPA website you can convince yourself that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that information systems for journalists would be available, but limited access to information to a large extent.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which is in line with a border conflict between both countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which begins on Monday in The Hague, in the process that led Lima against Santiago to listen to the pleaters on both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we are currently presenting to this international court," said Humala along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country which adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits itself to international courts," Piñera adds, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the IGH was made after Colombia had made a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered it a serious mistake to file a complaint against the Bogotá agreement, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 after its President Fernando Lugo has been disfellowshipping, did not take part in the meeting.
The guest president Ollanta Humala opened the talks on the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The Head of State left the final document, in which it stated that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action were set for 31 projects between the South American countries over an investment amount of 17 billion dollars.
Regarding the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He announced that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the case of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant challenges, but rather serve to expand our production performance and show our people a better future," said Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and establish new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a literate statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvians lying on the querachsens of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourhood relations was another aspect that was highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional meeting that on Saturday in Mexico he expected a meeting with his counterpart to Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict with respect for a judgment of the IGH in question by Bogotá.
"I may meet President Daniel Ortega on the morning (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua makes discussions with Nicaragua necessary," he underlined.
"I hope to be able to tell the President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the takeover of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nito.
As part of the summit, the Defense Ministers of the Block for the adoption of the 2013 Action Plan met in advance, in which the dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region will be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even though the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the Presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America needs to learn from the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South America (Unasur) held in Lima, told the public television in Peru that the Europeans were "in the second world war and in other conflicts" and "now practically a home country."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that is driving the members of the Unasur forward.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reorganisation of the United States Organisation (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and of taking into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to something, and in return, we always sign everything to the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its seat in Washington and is financed by the United States," he said as a reference to the political asylum that Ecuador granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles but had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that, at the time, there had been "founded assumptions that Assange would deliver to a third country and not comply with his procedure."
He also criticised Swedish justice, which he had requested to question him in his territory for a alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish case law allowed this by means of a videoconferencing which could have been executed via Ecuador's Embassy in London."
Correa explained that the risk would be that the health and mental condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since he is in our message, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," said Ecuador's head of state.
However, there was a risk that he would do physical and mental damage because he was caught in a narrow space and could not perform physical exercises outdoors.
"This would affect every person's health," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to asylum, which Assange was granted since June in Ecuador's Embassy in London, was the granting of a free letter with which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution to WikiLeaks' imprisoned founder.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not apply this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the Assange lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of proceedings at various European institutions," he said.
And "if Great Britain grants this letter tomorrow, I think this is done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange at Ecuador's Embassy in London or about Skype, how it was allowed and done in other cases, the problem would be solved.
Correa took advantage of the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he did not tolerate is "the mediocreness, the evil intention and the lie that dispel the freedom of expression."
"The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverted politicians, but the bad journalists who seek and extortion profit," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated Ecuador no longer being ruled by such journalists "and also not by the bankers or hegemonic and spewt-bourgeois countries," and presumptuously suggested that he "will deepen the revolution in order to continue the way in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and must not take on opportunism and not take on any of its legally dressed coups" because "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed."
The President of Ecuador also considers the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and in accordance with the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which favoured Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between both countries, "exclusively justified."
At present, this judgment is not implemented.
This is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in pursuit of a common path.
They must be treated in full, so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that "it is right for Latin America to call on international bodies if both countries undertake to accept the judgment, even if it is very hard."
Regarding the possibility of being a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to reach its third mandate in a row, he indicated that he saw this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa assured that if he left the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never personally been interested in power, but under such unfair circumstances as Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the faith that it was me who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to live up to this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last period as President, then I leave public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the vice-president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had traveled there for a planned routine treatment and that he would expect to travel to Cuba again after the election campaign.
"In no case does it mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
In Lima today, the European Head of State participated in the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for higher regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of dying due to AIDS is today too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the study result: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the doctor had "tryed to weaken" without a recognizable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and started to learn about it; and this with such a commitment that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) in which he came after several fighting in 1994.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, as there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
At that time AIDS was synonym for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic, who do not know about their illness and who have already done harm to the virus and have exhausted their immune system, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after AIDS appeared in the world, i.e. after the first cases reported, "the great success today indicates that the survival of a patient taking up treatment in due time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," stated Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of HCG's HIV unit, saying that this information had been supported by a respected scientific publication in April this year.
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system of the persons at the beginning of treatment, and that those greater opportunities that are not drug-dependent: up to 30 years when counting 200 CD4 and 50 years at a 500 CD4 count.
Simply put, the above statements mean that who receives the HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25 in this sense "can be without problems 75 years old as long as he is under control," this specialist explained.
In order to be able to correct this progress, it must be recalled that today the life expectancy of the Mexicans is an average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA Annual Report), it is nevertheless right that 60 percent of patients recorded in the national database have died since the publication of the AIDS database.
Alone in Jalisco died 255 people in 2011, and by May of this year there are already 187 deaths, but it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
So why are people still dying of it?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and that's what's in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have had no problems with the drug supply. The problem is that people come in far advanced condition because they do not know their state of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an associated infection. In order to be able to influence global mortality, earlier diagnostics are required, which is why every person in need of this must be offered massive detection tests."
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estate de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients such as Fabrizio who had his test carried out in a private laboratory, for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi sarco (a cancer-like tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they will die, and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather sit down three times," you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, drive sports and take the drugs.
Today his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work a lot, have an active, but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to stimulate with his testimony those who are afraid of today in the context of the worldwide AIDS day.
They should test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the shop table
There are great holes between the health programs and the simple citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the issue of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
At the places to that effect, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; they were previously handed out individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
Among the risk subjects for new infections are young people.
"What do you need this?" is a common ridicule question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system that young people do not want to stop, assured the correspondent.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the store table, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities that are frequently visited by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
They should not be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González answered to the question whether it would be prepared under his administration to distribute conservatives.
"Sexuality doesn't look like that; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who already practice a sexual activity," he put it at the point.
Key Data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally located at 4th place new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the infectious events occur over sex, 6% above blood, and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people for each registered case who do not know.
After the United States Appellate Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the Vitro Group's liabilities which has been reached through a trade transaction in Mexico, an unhealed precedent is created for each national undertaking with branches in neighbouring countries with payment problems.
So it could be said that in the country of stars and stripes, the procedures for the survival of companies that allow Mexican laws do not apply in the course of international agreements.
In practice, the recognition given on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Court of Justice in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas leads to the Mexican companies being helplessly exposed to confiscation of their property beyond the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens door and door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to call the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Appellate Court of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first states that the main proceedings are the trade bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures in the case of non-payment of companies with cross-border profiles is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law was created for the unification of international trade law, with the American Law Institute being used as a plainer.
Secondly, the judgment provides that, without the votes of the companies, after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass held by Vitro's branches with their parent company, the required majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundesinstitut für Handelskonkluse).
It is also right that after the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the Geier funds, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is indebted to its difficult situation from 2008 onwards in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave blows to the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family objected to the same appeal court, so that the vote would take place in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If not accepted, the Cerciorare opposition, which calls for the review of the proceedings by a higher court, shall be filed in that case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The gravity of this case is that the court has left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figurea amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), in which the Vitro procedure is described in the context of the Trade Conflicts Act, and in which it is pointed out that it was strictly in line with the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States bankruptcy law.
It should also be noted that the country has submitted itself to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the established rules on cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican air transport unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, did not move forward for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (union of pilots) finally made progress.
The request made by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of the disability of justice.
The supervisory authority has then systematically refused to inform the main administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to remove 198 million pesos from the trust account F/589 of Bank IXE on the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administra Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a Forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the national chamber of manufacturing industry) has achieved the unification of governors in the southeast to resist the monumental institution that partially destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a Senate request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived in accordance with the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place, although the Senate had disregarded the possibility of viewing them as a violation of freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex long term
In pursuit of paying long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the building company Homex puts stock exchange certificates on the market for over 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four equivalent emissions that an interest payment promises every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
Founded from NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a group of companies named Competival has been established, the aim of which is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to more than 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world bumper of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to the basket sport for more than 60 years and traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the country's basketball history as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, agent and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Association.
"For my life, I put up many hats in the basketball, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, head of the national team and president of the association in the 90s," Reyes recalled when visiting Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as a co-business leader or manager of the club.
"These were my best years that I enjoyed most because I had been part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967, whether it was as manager, co-business leader or trainer.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I left with a championship in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m-large player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the release specialist Raymond Gausse, who was a citizen and one of our best shipyards.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would care for another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already in the top place of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember winning for the first time at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the USA.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we occupied the fourth place, which should have been bronze, if not this Canadian arbitrator, who let us repeat the last turn of the game for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
My favorite, however, is the team of the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the US team a fight, as when they won against us at the World Cup Bronze.
In that team, not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were there again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there because of a knee injury in 1990.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great joy was the one of the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina in 1995.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rallando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the locked players due to the events on the Pan-American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every prognosis.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
That was certainly Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculín.
And this, without taking his career into account in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left of you?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessary travel and games.
At least I see the outcome of the required training and courses for trainers, table officials and arbitrators.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like listening to music, watching videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and occasionally going to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always at my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played an unscrupulous, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas", became a symbol of the greed of the 80s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved birth city Dallas, where he played the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the festival of harvest thanks.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and succession series, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas Hospital, said her publisher Jeffrey Lane.
He made all the joys that knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I'm going to miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full swings," Gray said in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he drank a lot over the years.
In 1995 a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and he became a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas", Hagman became known as a nice guy from 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Beautiful Jeannie" of the television station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "Jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He was also an actor of two comedies, which were broadcast for only a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Lord We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinema works included well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchanting abominable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the television chain CBS over the Ewing clan and other characters around it was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising statement "Who shot at J.R.?" was supposed to create the expectation for an episode full of emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were waged in bethouses.
This made the series reach a spectator record at that time.
When the answer was announced in a November 1990 chapter, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin who had shot J.R.'s brother-in-law (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had hesitated her and threatened to represent her as prostitutes if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons for wanting to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a careless businessman and unfaithful husband seeking to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) appointed.
"I know what to stand on the tombstone of J.R.," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-author of the original series, remembered Hagman as a "normal personality on and outside the screen" on Friday.
He is unforgettable and unforgettable to millions of devotees in the world and remains to us who have had the happiness of knowing and loving him in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just shot, the transmitter informed.
There was no immediate explanation of how Hagmann's loss in the series would be handled by Warner or TNT.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a youth when she got Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the New York theater shows at the beginning of the 1950s, after which he served in the Air Forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything I believed would harm someone or harm him in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After he was transplanted, he took up liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are ahead and beyond," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "no fear, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He also opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course studying the "End of the World"
Every week the students investigate apocalyptic topics such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long back counting" of the Maya calendar on December 21st, of which many people believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place of which the Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't notice that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever there," said Charmé this week to students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyses what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that this is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which should be the last in history.
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week the students investigate apocalyptic topics such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month, the students analysed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they compared themselves to the real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," said Baker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course with the simple term "The End of the World".
"We do not record 2012 so that we can always keep the option of resuming the course, in case the world does not go down," restall said.
Despite the "predicted downfall", students have to study, build projects and participate in final examinations.
In Penn State, the final exam is carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance than "to continue working until the night, where the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," Restall said about his course for students with high average who filled with 35 students.
Weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked if there were still places free.
The students, on the other hand, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutger's camp for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectality or religious mentality is actually just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa explains that he has seen all apocalyptic films.
"Never have I heard anything from a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed - and less a professor - declared to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayas' prophecy, and in a certain way we discredit them," said Julie Zelen, student in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester last year.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, restall said.
However, he notes that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that leads back several centuries when people responded to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"Otherwise, people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course on the "end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world", he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a mercy from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken of by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21st, "people immediately think about a new date" or that December 21st was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world came.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they wanted to go to celebration about "the end of the world".
"Maybe I'm calling some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
