Barack Obama will receive the Nobel Peace Prize as President of the United States
American President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a cheque of over $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House will arrive tomorrow together with his wife Michelle in the Nordic metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First of all he visits the Nobel Institute, where he met for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The president then planned a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony, where Obama takes the prestigious prize.
He receives this as the fourth US president, but only as the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will speak about the Afghanistan War when the price is taken over.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking the prize as a president who is currently warring in two countries.
A few days ago, he strengthened the efforts of the war by sending other troops to Afghanistan, which did not forget any of his critics.
At the ceremony Obama also received the gold medal, the diploma and cheque over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to donate for benevolent purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete caritative work.
The event programme then provides for a banquet with the President and his wife, in which besides Norway's King and Queen also the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very reluctant from the start of the price.
He suggested, for example, that he had the feeling that he did not deserve the price entirely.
On several occasions, he also repeated that the price is not just for him, but for those who want the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this was "compulsory to action" for him.
Naturekeeper is accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz-Policei accused the chairman of the civil society association "Natuurschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" for extortion.
In several cases last year he filed appeals against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his vocations he demanded money from investors in his favor, said the Leimeritz-Policesprecher, Alena Romova.
The Chairman of the Leitmeritz-Natureschutzgemeinschaftist Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in custody and he's threatened with a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorter waste containers in Brno don't smell good
In Prague, people can sort the drinks packaging, and in the South Moravian villages you will find the sorter waste containers again on foot.
What about Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate waste concretes.
I don't want to claim that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Council members are not sufficiently concerned about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is located in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we, as citizens, are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorter container, but above all through the amount of waste for such waste.
Have they tried sometime in the center to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket?
This is art, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found by chance to date is the breeding ground opposite the geese hit.
Mr Underka's colleagues should not be angry with us, but this is far too little for me.
Apart from the fact that the separation of waste in other parts is not a honey snail.
That's why entire rows of my friends don't sort the waste at all.
Out of laziness.
It's too far too far to the garbage tones.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself after the celebration to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova street, I didn't see any paint muzzles in sight.
Fortunately, I got to the right place when driving the tram.
But the garbage was almost over.
That's still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably make the Brno socialists cold.
You'd rather buy the city an ice hockey league that's causing us shame in the whole Republic, instead of buying a few garbage nuts more and offering the sort of other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
In spite of the government's view, after the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials, there is no money in the budget for pensions, health and construction savings.
But neither for the interest in public debt nor for the international court disputes.
This causes even more problems that will be with the government in the second half of next year, says Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the S & Ds and Communists asserted the increase in salary for some groups, they calculated that the government would extradite the money for sensitive spending, old-age pensions or for the health allowance. "This is just a delay of problems in the future, laying mines," says Janota.
The loans are normally always paid higher interest rates, and you have to refund the money back at some point.
Too much to choose from where to go, the state funds is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the public operation are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for her children.
In order to get the pensions or the health allowance, whose account has disappeared 1.8 billion, people don't have to be afraid, they get this money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing, but far more.
Despite the efforts of the Minister Janota, debt will increase faster and, together with this, also costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money to compensate, then it will not be enough to increase VAT little more or to reduce maternity money, as the government made in its area deficit package.
As a result of the cash reduction in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the extension of motorways and railways.
It is mainly the sections gained in the competition that can no longer be reprojected and possibly accepted.
Getting maximum, which is not also free.
This means a delay or attitude of thirty large buildings, a threat to Europe's money creation, warns the Minister of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the outflow of money in a salomonic manner - it attacks the CEZ-Aktendivids in which the state is the owner of the majority, and from which the money is then distributed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the level of the dividend is never safe and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion went to the budget.
Every year, the dividends pay the environmental damages, the pension account is filled up, and this money is also used as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
Moreover, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to the level of 5.7% GDP in accordance with EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of revolutions.
Almost three billion went down the budget for various compensations for victims of Communism and of crimes or expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state will do without this money is not certain.
That's pure gambling.
If we lose an international court case, we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister must then save the money in the middle of the country or attack the government budget reserve in the worst case.
One hundred million are also missing for the two-billion project "State Bank", which should allow on-line monitoring for what individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
The Americans expect a cell phone for the future on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It's enough to just press one key, and from Windows Mobile will switch to Android within a few seconds.
This is exactly the opportunity that American society wants to introduce VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtual software for the computer.
We allow you to run two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can switch between these, they can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both of them will work in parallel, Syniva's Krishnamurti from the company VMware indicated in the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
On the market it will come 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware successfully introduced the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which parallel Windows Mobile and Android were running at the same time.
The development of the new mobile phone technology is in full swing.
The company VMware is now working with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and the customer is expected to get the devices within 2012.
Snow shortage on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Scneeless slopes not only worry the Giant Mountains inhabitants.
The missing snow also deters people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but in the meantime they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask us if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on match", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
Anyone who wants to stay in the spindle mill exactly according to his ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Anyone who prefers to save and in which the quality of stay comes only in second place, who can try to wait a few days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they're going to try to sell them for a while, but then they'll have to give up, and go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, Jandura estimated.
Free beds at all winter dates always offers the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, led by the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer the New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains, but there are fewer free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are on average sold.
This year's interest in winter stays is also affected by the fact that in Giant Mountains there is always no snow.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, the Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Reverse and a little better than last year, the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou manage to occupy.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Day and on Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
At the central parking lot in Janske Lazne, Hotel Omnia is occupied by 80 percent for New Year's Eve stays.
On the other hand, the latest hotel in Janske Lazne remains half of the beds at Christmas.
We were surprised this year in January for which we are currently occupied by about 60 percent.
A bit weaker is now February, but at the moment when the snow comes, probably also the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains is growing, led by the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The Giant Mountains hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snowshed.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it comes to rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, another warming was to come, Jiri informed Jakubsky from the site of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeating is Mother of Wisdom
It is almost funny with which student determination Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question he himself thought to be the stupidest.
When he finally turned out to be his longingly expected Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it down on the copy paper from the Busch-Irak scenario three years ago.
Not only that in the text itself he uses several times the style of speech "as in Iraq", he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New forward path", without blaming.
Three years ago, he even criticized the Bush idea - fresh military quotas in Iraq who was plagued by the civil war - as "an irresponsible and carastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush Strategy, based on recommendations from the military, was the only possible and very successful one that today is not speaking at all in the news about Iraq at all.
Bush's reputation was not improved by this, for objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting position than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle is repeated.
In order to increase the military quota, the military asked him again, especially the commander of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, even despite subordinating habits, strongly criticized the dwindling shooters in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea and so he deceived the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he has pressed the promise for another 5,000, even though he himself originally calculated at least 10.000.
Most problematic in the whole Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan already in 18 months and complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half-up will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the brotherly war of recent years, the Iraq Society is relatively well structured, their leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by the contraindication - nobody can be relied upon and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to change their mind every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only bulwark, behind which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interest between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the uncertainty of the circumstances which further complicate Pakistan and Iran's influences.
It is also very unrealistic to build a "permanent state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation.
Time horizon of Obama's strategy disintegrated by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and now it is on the verge of explosion.
This believes that the small soldiers who broke out in the cry of war over the "early home return" can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of the troops is purely irresponsible, because the Taliban will accept it as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the battles in Afghanistan tends.
Europe's politicians can and do not want to explain to their voters how Germany's or Italy's security is linked to the war in the Hindukush mountain region.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, there is a very serious question for the United States whether the problem should not be solved by troops.
This question must be answered during the period during which America goes to Obama to win the victory from Afghanistan.
However, each solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolator for Barack Obama is the fact that three more years remain until the presidential election, and thus there is still enough time for him to take a different strategy to prove it to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs' managers no longer receive bonuses in cash
The executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which is responding to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive instead of the money shares, which you can only sell in five years.
In addition, shares can be removed from managers if they act overly riskyly.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street's premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, led the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made herself the target of criticism after she put aside almost $17 billion for bonus bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total premium bonuses over the course of this year are likely to exceed 20 billion dollars according to the Reuters Agency.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries with the beginning of the financial crisis.
UK reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the bonuses of bankers who exceed 25,000 pounds once with a tax of 50 percent.
France is also preparing for similar steps.
This year, women won Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Today in Stockholm, five record women from Sweden's King Carl XVI. Gustaf took over this year's Nobel Prizes in the categories of subjects and literature.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer, Herta Müller, was among them.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak have received the Nobel Prize for Medicine.
The award for chemistry was awarded by the Israeli Ada Jonath together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for the clarification of the ribosome structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao have contributed this award to research in the glass fibre sector and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip discovery, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these prizewinners has received the diploma, Nobel-Medaile and certificate of acquisition of the money price.
This is 10 million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prizewinners in each category, the money price is distributed among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has received the most expected Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he recognized the controversy of his appointment because he was only at the beginning of his path and was also at the forefront of the country that is holding two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, while respecting his policy, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the fight against world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes the finance minister, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his remaining in the government on Friday, because he does not agree with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form as released by the Assembly of Members on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remaining Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The President spokesperson Radim Ochvat informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday about his further stay in his role.
According to the budget law, which now receives Klaus's signature, the Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the Left Party proposals on the restitution of funds and increased the money for public servants, the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has held back the proposals of social democracy that it conceals the budget deficit.
On the other hand, between the Left Party on the one hand and the Government, Klaus and the Legal Party, on the other hand, there has been a sharp internal-political dispute, which is why the question mark arises about the further work of the Fischer Office, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was accepted by Parliament, is practically liquidating the package of austerity measures enforced by the fishermen's government in autumn, which, according to their understanding, is to end the public debt.
Klaus, who is able to sign the law on the state budget, but does not have to, today declared to the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that the politicians have neglected the "early problem", which is "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a longer period of time.
In his opinion, today there is no good solution.
An improvement could only lead to a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, stated that the budget is cruel, and the government should weigh its further existence.
The ODS chairperson, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the civil servant cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, obviously no longer works.
Premier Fischer referred to similar words as "strong expressions" in the editorial work.
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was cruel that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget as a success for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new movie by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeated" in the world shows much of the country whose struggle and victory despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his life story of American Oscar Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could represent him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon takes on another significant role.
I told him, "When I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the box area "Million Dollar Baby" was already the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which at the end has become a slave holder, a fictitious U.S. president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely anyone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for his active activity at the termination of apartheid in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became President of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeated", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, who was published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pieaker, to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that even after apartheid, his people still remain racially and economically shared.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to agree on the rugby players who are among the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises until the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to approach it as closely as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, eat with him at night and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I have determined when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it is transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
For me, it is important to have become another person.
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I sounded at the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual models, under the direction of the director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeated" he received positive reviews and one also speaks of views of an Oscar.
The film critic of the Blatts Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "That was very good story, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages of rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light Secret About Norway Dissolved: The Russians Tested a rocket
A special lighting effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense only last night admitted that near the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
However, the start was not successful again and the rocket called the type "Bulava", which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of Russian generality as well as the premiere, Vladimir Putin.
Also his repeated presence at the rocket test on site had no positive effect on the success of the pilot flights.
Bulava has usually not been started or damaged in the air at all.
In the Russian newspapers, one already writes about "Bulava" as a "Rakete who doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly, but lights
This already 13th attempt was normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight did technical damage occur to the rocket.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of rockets.
This time, "Bulava" started from the atom U-boat Dmitrij Donskij, which drove under the water of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the U-boat shot.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an undetermined flying object over northern routes was actually the damaged "bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian rocket since the first moment.
Generality has been guarded against this time and claimed that one cannot clearly speak of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and the accident was only affected by the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test launch took place without a mistake, the management of the Ministry of Defense considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fulfils the generality with optimism and so it continues to claim that the "bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic atomic heads with a total weight of a maximum of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Vjaceslav Fetisov again presents himself in a professional ice hockey game at 51 years of age.
The former World Champion, Olympia winner and Stanley Cup holder helps his team CSKA Moscow in distress, and is probably already in the Fridays Duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who finished his career with forty years, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed to support the team.
We only need to clarify some other formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of Sergej Nemcinov's Moscow Club.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only affect a game.
I mean, that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other players, led co-player Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice surface, he becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford with fifty-one years and was awarded 15 hits and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
He won two Olympic gold medals, seven world champions in the dress of the Soviet Union, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he also collected successes in the NHL, where he twice raised the Stanley Cup over his head in the Detroit Dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the ice hockey star room.
Hyundai gave up the trade unions. All overtime are lifted
The management of the Nosovice Automobilfabrik Hyundai agreed with the union to abolish all overtime.
Because of frequent overtime overtime, the union announced that it was ready to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the speaker of the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
The management, however, wants to agree with the trade unionists about a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday December 19th, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two working layers would be worked, said Vanek.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered the employees who would work the Saturday shift a bonus of 400 CZK.
The staff will also receive this in retrospect for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they pay the overtime supplement or they can take replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas celebrations, Vanek recorded.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the ticket and lunch.
Taking into account that overtime was the most urgent and burning point regarding trade union demands and complaints that had ceased production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the withdrawal of all overtimes for the month of December, Vaněk stated.
The car factory employees had been forced to work 2 overtime hours every day after the eight-hour shift until last week.
Once the agreement has been signed, trade unions will withdraw their willingness to strike.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists will be held on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on meeting the demands and sign a joint document, they will be willing to stop strike-out.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the automotive factory has increased, when about 400 employees spontaneously worked out because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management held that employees had to take overtime to meet the automotive supply needs.
The trade unionists also called for no sanctions on the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, trade unions demand that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, this year they demand the payment of 5,000 crowns.
The Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Serial production was started at the company last November.
By September, about 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in “hiv-viruses”
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses into the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in the viruses that are already resistant to medication.
This fact predominates against the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the existing medicinal products.
The AIDS disease cannot be cured yet.
The patient may, however, extend the composition of drugs and prevent the reproduction of HIV viruses in the body.
However, their intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Inadequate suppression of virus reproduction also results in the development of resistant viruses that are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, VSCHT (Chemic-Technological University) Prague and Heidelberg University opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances described as Metalocarborane have an effect on the protein that is responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
Metalocarborene are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus reproduction in a way other than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new ́improved ́ links prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the virus protein.
The Metalokarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two many cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms, coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Homeless and Persistent Virus
HIV protease is protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus division caused by HIV protease, mature infection virus particles would not arise.
If we disable the HIV protease, we also eliminate the increase of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of connections in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further changed.
Something weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this range of substances against the HIV protease is tested in the test tube, including against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborene on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the resistance variants against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its further properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and potential for other chemical designs, makes the Metalocarboras interesting connections for further research aimed at the development of effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
ODS started on fisherman who fights for budgets.
The president of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as "greyful" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its further existence.
The statement by the ODS called the Prime Minister "strong statements".
It's supposed to be time for analysis.
The deputy ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit or whether it is his remaining in office with the help of Parliament's left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, but with left-wing amendments over 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for public servants, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
In doing so, the government has held back the proposals made by the Social-Democratic Party that it conceals the increase in the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic was to operate 163 billion crowns with a residue.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has complied with the government's wish, because the changed budget is only a less poor variant of the budget provisional. Frase not clear
Disillusionment and senselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke about his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer argued that the government still assesses the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota were seriously threatened with his resignation for the case, the proposed amendments would be accepted that the situation would look different.
According to Czech television Janota has signed up for the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
In doing so, he indicated that he considered his remaining in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment about the handling of the budget.
To what extent is fishermen in favour of the further fight with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the Socialists (CSSD) who have made the changes in the budget have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also state clearly that he will withdraw if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those concerning sickness and pensions or the service law.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS did not err
This is the case of the Premier Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the USA.
It has been mentioned that in some ministries, people sit in deputy positions who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide to refrain from the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that they are based on the majority of the left that is currently in Parliament".
Then, supposedly, he cannot count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that is to happen, then I will deal with it, the Minister of Defense Martin Bartak, nominated by the citizens' Democrats, told the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer went to Brussels in the afternoon at the European Council.
The ODS returned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday, if the Prime Minister would expressly ask the members of the citizens' Democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We are not orphans, we are not young children, he then replied to the question whether the ODS was not repressed by the absence of the party president in Parliament and in the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my voice would be missing.
Even when I refused the mandate, I knew that in the coming months, above all, it would be all positive to Bolshevisation of Parliament and Destruction, Topolanek himself responded.
After the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will travel for about the same driving price.
The Czech Railways will end or restrict some less charged fast and local trains as of 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The whole range of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new Roadmap compared to today.
Most tariffs including basic and customer fare are not changed.
Several connections to the capital, for example, receive the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway uses trains of the Pendolino type for this route.
The express train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less express trains will also be on the line Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections are reduced from Prague to Letohrad.
The biggest reduction is planned by the railways in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tabor - Budweis and on a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the line Prague - Pisek - Budweis is reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, which currently requires the change of the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko district transport system, which can be opened by rail electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distances to the capital will end in the destination station Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will travel at two hours' distance.
With the Pendolino, passengers have been unable to drive to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's regional railway bill: increase by 200 million
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, overall, the railways will receive four billion crowns in the next year, exactly as this year. Local trains will provide the districts with a total of eight billion crowns in the next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the express trains, the railway has renewed a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always only been concluded for one year.
The railways praise the system, perhaps because of this, it has not been used to increase prices for the large majority of tickets.
Changes occur only with one-day web ticket CD Net and with cheap Internet ticket eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven port, until now it was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine millitants capture more than 50 people, the children were released.
Today, billions of refugees kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some schoolchildren and their teachers.
This was led by the AFP Agency, which initially informed only over 65 kidnappers.
All 17 recorded children were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
It was abducted in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millitants were said to use hostages as a living shield when fleeing the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the remaining hostages.
According to the agency AFP, the billions belong to the New People's Army (NPA), this is the arms fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnapper for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right to stand was imposed because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November, which was associated with the election to the Governor's Office, 30 journalists were.
Because of suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippines province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday the peace talks with the Philippine government resumed.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood movie Clint Eastwoods comes to the American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeaten", which includes part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has received Morgan Freeman, who had been supposedly selected by Mandela himself some years ago.
Matt Damon has received the side role of the legendary South African Champions in Rugby, Francois Pieaner.
With the film's launch, reactions from critics and the public are also made loud.
Nelson Mandela
His name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, then in 1993 together with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are put in the film because it comes to cinemas at a time when preparations for the World Championships in South Africa, on the one hand, are culminating in the preparations for the World Championship, but at the same time the media are shaking the world's public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are first and foremost positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the major roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared for it well.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally so that, as you say, I can receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can get Mandela's personality and his message with this film.
This is a story of South Africa, but it concerns every human being, he added.
In the dress of the rugby national team
The film is based on the book of the British writer John Carlin, freely translated “In the role of the enemy”: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people have united, portraits the South African champion of human rights within his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racial and day-to-day groups of people, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays in his role in the South African National Rougbydress on the World Cup field that won South Africa at that time.
For entering the lawn in the dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela reaped fourteen years ago great ovations, mostly from the white audience and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may accomplish joining people into a single people, led rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves, that will only show itself.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, as for example in recent interview for LN of the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The championship will begin on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for more than 10 million crowns
The fire broke out at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear at the municipality of Vykov in the Louny area.
In the fire, six units attacked Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, according to the spokesperson of the district fire brigade.
Originally the fire brigade to burn the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is erased with a mixture of water - foam and special solvents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer-in short circuit.
No one was injured, the Havarie did not endanger the security operation of the management system, according to the company spokesman, Pavla Manmentova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, and the damage will only be done after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to mandateova.
For over 10 years, there has been nothing similar in Ceps society, mistakes of this kind are rare, supplemented them.
The power supply was not interrupted according to the CEZ spokesman for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, because of the fire of the trafostation the functionality of households, authorities and companies was not affected.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech field as sole operator of the cable system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovated and develops 39 switchgear systems with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred into distribution system and pipeline with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura charges for slander against three CSSD leaders.
The owner of the student agency, Radim Jancura, is now suing for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from South Moravia, Radko Martinek from Pardubice District and head of Olomouc District, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the Radiojournal.
The action is related to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in some districts.
All regions, however, have finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take the raisins out, but we only offered the offer on the extent to which it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways that were completed last week.
That's not the way we're left to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the student agency society, Jancura told the radiojournal.
At the same time, he argued that he had evidence from all the districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of criminal charges for the further continuation of Jancura's medial show, which serves as free advertising for his company as well as for his own.
Of course, I am ready to defend my good name as well as the good reputation of my district, and I also ask for further leaders.
I assume that this issue will also make it clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the case of regional one-way traffic and uses lying and untrue arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the adverse step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he was breaking the campaign after Christmas and that he wanted to continue after New Year's Day.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign initiated Jancura after the districts agreed to operate regional rail transport with the Czech Railway and did not issue a tender for the contract in a high of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, because of the criticism of the train traffic in the districts, a member of the CSSD was already threatening him.
The only threat was, if we don't give up, that we can lose bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, said Jancura to the radiojournal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease free and voluntary
Vaccination against pneumococcals changes from January onwards.
It is the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But now votes are reporting that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcals cuminate.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting the maximum prices of vaccines that health insurance must pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines for free for August children
As of January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccination dose.
Anyone who has started vaccination in the past year or earlier must also pay for further vaccination.
The first dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life of the child.
Last year a quarter of the families had their children immunized against pneumococcals.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that the health insurance companies spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year for vaccination doses.
However, they save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 a year on all surface vaccinations of the children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced using the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcals cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
By pneumococcal infections, we die with us after examination in hospitals per year up to 28 children aged up to 10 years.
Outside the Czech Republic the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January this is to be paid by the insurance companies and voluntary.
The fact that the vaccination of duty would be better, for example, was mentioned by the head of the civil association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association has been throwing for pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we had voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in implementing at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, led Kalovsky.
The Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal agents.
At this moment we don't consider that at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The chairman of the specialist society of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the number of re-vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one," says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants immigrated against pneumococcals next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcals is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is the first area vaccination paid by the health insurance companies and not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend the money on prevention to save them for further treatment, Cabrnochova.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, involves a concern of the practical pediatricians who are concerned with the purchase of vaccines.
After the initial project, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors should then receive them on the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the State.
Some Members, however, feared that the insurance companies could "run the money out of health insurance".
That is why doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them these.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
Cabrnochova says that won't be easy.
US artist son involved in "Museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth 20 million dollars from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was put in his vehicle while loading 90 paintings.
It means that Frank Frazetta junior and another man would have used a excavator to get into the museum into the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his depiction of figures such as Conan der Barbar and Tarzan.
As the Associated Press news agency reported, the artist stopped at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported that according to a police advocacy statement Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father that "he should penetrate the museum with all means to bring all the paintings to a camp".
The Agency announced that Frank Frazetta Senior was in dispute about granting any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending stops announced in the Pre-Economic Report against the criticism of opposition, economy and trade unions.
Conservatives said Alistair Darling would have left an opportunity to "delete" to show that he meant it seriously with reducing the deficit by pushing out the decisions until after the election.
The treasurer also claimed that he was targeting workers with low and medium incomes.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1 percentage reduction in the public wage balances for 2011.
Social security providers
The trade unions have protested that low-earners are being punished for a recession they did not cause and warned of upcoming "problems".
The increase in social security - to about 3 billion pounds per year - has made the private economy worse, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although attention should be paid to the economic upturn.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than $20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
TERMS OF THE PROPOSAL ETATING REPORT
Increase in social security by 0.5% from April 2011
This year's downturn in the economy by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50 % tax on bankers bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Tax returns on electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in government pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates of the Treasury, a person with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer at £90 a year, and someone with £40,000 a year will be poorer by £190, while a person with £10,000 will be richer by £110.
Ministers said that their target of deficit reduction was "silver decisions" by 2013, but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would be paid to the 5% of the top beneficiaries.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms argued that the sketched tax increases and spending stops would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit balance, and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he informed the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Projections by the Labour Party on future economic growth – which influence the scope of re-indebtedness and the speed of deficit reporting – were questioned after the shadowant was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to decrease by 4.75% this year - far more than the decrease of 3.5% predicted in April - while debt would be up by £3 billion than previously estimated.
Missed opportunity
The conservatives who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of the "stupid crisis" of Labour said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years is unsustainable.
They added that ministers have failed to present a credible plan, how they will pay back this and press themselves "synically" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"They didn't say anything about what they're going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this and they let them pass by."
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists on the preservation of schools, hospitals and the police from future cuts, unlike in the proposals made by conservatives who see the deficits coming faster and more.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by tax increases and spending stops is used to cover the next year's expenditures, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements, such as the inflation adjustment on some invalidity pensions in April next, the shadowant would suspend the accusation of voting because the money could be recovered just next year.
Labour insists on providing extra assistance if people need it most and the situation is re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although ministers have not announced any details of budget beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only come about in the medium term.
The renowned Institute for Tax Investigations said that the number of the Treasury would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain later," said Robert Chote.
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant to Deloitte's audit firm.
"This was only the hollow advance etat report. The markets recognize that."
FBI investigates "Developments of US Citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest of five US citizens reported because of the suspicion of extremist compounds in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid at a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Panjab province, the American Embassy in Pakistan informed the BBC.
The FBI said it's being investigated whether these are the same men that were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The US Department of Foreign Affairs said that they are looking for information about the men.
Three of them are to be Pakistani descent, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"When they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges they are accused of and under what circumstances they are held," said Speaker Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesperson Katherine Schwaw said the authority was informed of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house that belongs to the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had previously been interested in the house and had not yet been filed charges against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US must "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "mistakes" in Iran
According to a report by the Amnesty International human rights organisation, human rights in Iran are still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report detailes the regime's "misuse patterns" both before and after the presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report said that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights balance.
Officials said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the election of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens of people were killed, leading to the biggest road protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens of people were sentenced to death, and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC-Teheran Correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Strafanstalt.
But since then there has been no tolerance for criticism by the authorities, our correspondent said.
"Falsche's confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of working with Facebook networks and protesting against the election results.
"They used to beat me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humbled me."
After five days he signed a false confession and was, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, informed Amnesty.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August in prison and raped others.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained in a container in a Kahrizak penitentiary with 75 other than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had established a committee that should investigate the unrest after the election and the reactions of the government to it, but so Amnesty, the mandates and powers of these bodies would have been unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that during the last three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to transform a landmark into a competition path in Bristol.
The ski slopes of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prizes.
At the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-metre-long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city glistening below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best works of art or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still She and We
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a building ban for minarette and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-founded and well-founded report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe’s most declared secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book from admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (2006), an elegant and densely reasoning study of a dispute that shared and occupied the country over a decade and a half and a half and whose effects can still be seen today.
Bowens' latest book offers a more comprehensive and bold spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the field.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now offer 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as it calls Bowen "Islamic Spaces".
He is a good listener, he restores debates between teachers and students on the questions they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permitted for a Muslim to use a sense-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profan affairs, he claims, which make up daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, possibly except Tarik Ramadan, an Arabic-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and, on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who surveyed the Bows are mostly inconvenient with their Salafi pieces – champions of purist Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a treaty requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions to what extent French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He indicates that Muslims may experience a harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who in turn had to make their historical compromise with secular Republicanism.
He sees a "sharpening of the values screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book you are inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most comforting view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that marks it melts with alarming speed and takes life with it, which can survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fisheries have entered into the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear, in "On thin ice".
Emigrated in the complicated history and politics of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an polar bear as a brave 14-year-old purgatory to the lake, who fought only with the rifle battling of his Muskete, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century showed 75 polar bears during an idea.
Even today, zoos still typically own a millionth of the habitat of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore was very green from the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the accounts of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the siege continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters use powerful storm guns in helicopters and engine-driving Inuit to take their prey off.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of the scientific magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientist nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
This is not due, however, to a lack of attempts to explain.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries made for the first time the confusion of the package ice.
Undersea boats presumptuously in the Cold War the shifting gruesomes on the underrun.
A useful supplement are satellite measurements and the large-scale deployment of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people camping outside the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the strange, tiny world of the flow system within the Arctic ice, which is formed by saltwater cinnamon halls that are pressed together during freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer ice passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... could be the We"
Marine infantry was among the 6,000 who were laid down in Arlington Kranze
De'Angelo Robinson, who was the first to travel seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other marine infantry who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Court in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they stepped.
In a few months, from whereever we are brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay cranes on the tombs of veterans in several sections of the Arlington-Friedhof.
Morrisl Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves on the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrisill and his wife Karen, who makes this trip every year, are holding along the way in various cities to conduct events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (Krenze throughout America), which has also expanded the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 cranes on the graves on the Arlington cemetery, in areas on the Pentagon, in graves of the National Court of Peace Fayetteville in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York, and in memory of the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the second time for the purchase and transport of the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said that she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to return something that the victims offered.
She said this is a small contribution we can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Packed in hot clothes, volunteers wandered across the wide lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as a goal, as they are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples kept at hand, while they carried the fresh pine branches to the gray tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the dark mood of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed and families and friends held on to one another in the icy air.
Some read out according to the stone names, while others turned down to small black and white postcards, which were stuck for those in the damp mud whose gravestones had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who forged bitter tears before her son's grave.
She went 8 hours by Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the graveyard of marine infrared officer David Shane Spicer, who fell into battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free ..., my son paid for it, she said.
"If I'm not a long time ago, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. government contractors arrested Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Foreign Ministry on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been able to be identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers such as USAID, the U.S. International Development Authority and the World Bank.
Consular officials representing the USA in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner arrested on December 5th.
The special charges have not yet been published, although Cuban law allows a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor to be arrested for almost everything under the accusation of the "hazard".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including slight protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Government-enemy graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will probably increase the tensions between the communist government of the Castro Brother in Cuba and the Obama government, which sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The message of the arrest was first reported on Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy stresses that the United States will make a return when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of a government employed is 15 dollars per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens this year to buy a mobile phone, they are used today for sending text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a day's wage.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Too many websites are restricted access.
In Cuba the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba sit behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, Gloria Berbena, the U.S. interest representative in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any further information on arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - giving free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently produced a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, Same Cuba", a reference to the establishment of Raul Castro as the leader of the country replacing the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were arrested, sentenced and detained very often within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just when both countries are moving towards greater willingness to dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of conspiracy that aimed to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said that they hoped that this case could help to discover an extensive network of terrorist candidates who would pick up the Internet for radicalized young men.
Researchers said they had been looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them out because one of them, on the Internet video site YouTube, had given a comment on terrorist attacks.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after arriving in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was informed about the matter, said Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Kaida leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy on the migration of the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a hidden operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and continued to seek the right recommendations to gain access to the al-Kaida warehouses when they were arrested by the Pakistani criminal authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and who are being questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of applicants in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence service has made it a matter of utmost urgency to accommodate human assets within Al Kaida.
The promoters of the organization act as a doorkeeper who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
A Kaida conducted a special examination of American woolen recruits, said analysts.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are considered to be extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst of NEFA-Foundation based in the USA, said that terror groups have become much more cautious in recent years with regard to whom they allow access, because the US intelligence services have become experts of their recruitment methods.
When trying to drag someone into these groups, what better way could one go than following the recruitment model that so many have followed?, Kohlmann said.
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demand climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded more bold action by the traffickers in the Bella Congress Centre of the city to protect the climate.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were more like 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists fired small explosives near some government buildings in the city center.
One day, when little happened in the climate negotiations funded by the UN, thousands of activists moved through the city, where "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish said "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to Peru, the country of birth of her mother, made her aware of the heartrending problems that the country has to face because of the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I decided to take part in the great demonstration - in order to continue the word and appeal to world leaders, to establish a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there's no way to take it around.
The police stopped the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carried a knife.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be mentioned as he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked protesters in black clothing lit several explosives near the Copenhagen main canal, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the building, he said and added that they began as a light rocket, but then followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the convention centre, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest seems to have not reached the consciousness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I wasn't aware of at all."
He then went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is large, I can't hear what happens outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "they can also be said to disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent racial gap
The mathematics testimonies were welcome last week good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although Washington district is still far behind the country’s schools, the highest performance is shown by evidence that the fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both at local and national level.
The average score of the white fourth graders from Washington D.C. increased from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), but only three points from 209 to 212 increased their African American equal numbers.
The power gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African American eight graders remained basically the same, he fell by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data, as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap, which separated white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points that children of both groups have reached has increased in this period of time, the difference with now 58 points has hardly decreased.
Some educational supporters of the district expressed their concern last week that the results celebrated by Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were largely driven by white students who are already powerful children anyway.
This indicates that we have raised the overall ranking by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that represents education equality in Washington D.C..
I do not jump up and down for a span of two or three points, said the democratic Washington City Councilman, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton Primary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of the test points is that the city's secondary schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs that I respect.
But what scares me is that we do not nearly spend the time and energy we have to use for our secondary school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak students.
In this fall, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson reading system, which aims at students in the upper classes of primary school and secondary school, which basic skills of reading have not mastered at the beginning of their school career and which are significantly behind their class comrades of the same age.
Day-to-day mathematics, a curriculum that focuses from kindergarten to sixth-class games and life-like experiences, has been brought to Washington under the former senior school inspector Clifford Janey and this curriculum will be attributed to some of the NAEP advances reported last week.
I think we must continue to work to make the best measures available to students below the level of grades, said Rhee.
Others say that NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and can continue to provide additional money and resources for the poor schools that are not necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor of Education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could create political disadvantages that are working against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point is of course, as with other city school inspectors, that she tries to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the districts so that all families, no matter where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for closing the power gap is to extend the traditional public school year currently in Washington 180 days to compete with the charter schools.
One must increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year over 185 days a year, which he considers to be "a milestone" on the way to a larger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises and shines a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald grass.
Graciela's parents have barely completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was buried in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight graders of the group, who explore Gettysburg, where the class costs $38,690, was more of an awe - inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! Here I will be soon!" said Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she thoughtfully said when she was reported to the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they fully accepted the message they intended: the question is not whether you go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of Hispanic immigrants born in the USA who do not end high school or become pregnant as a teenager, on the other hand there are also hundreds of thousands who receive college training that is necessary to get into the middle class.
In fact, one of five of Hispano-Americans' "second generation" completes college – which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the workers of the country.
Those who investigate powerful children often say they have a natural affinity for school and a driving force that inhabits them to success.
Many of them also have parents who set their children high targets and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But consulting programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to come to college, especially if these efforts continue over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, said that hispanoAmerican students were studying.
We need to think about providing a supporting network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program that Graciela's college tour financed is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - A gear up - and makes more than 300 million dollars a year available for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in high school and continue to work until they finish high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of whom more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraq Oil Ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has, at two auctions concluded on Saturday, been able to bring greater oil companies to rebuild their damaged infrastructure.
The 10 agreements concluded with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralysed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
US companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only company that made a bid has moved short.
Two American companies have been able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multiplicity at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its gates after 6 years of war and instead of US companies offer Asian and European paths, Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, a online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns still underlined by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability due to the withdrawal of the US military have probably prevented American oil companies from engaging more in Iraq, said analysts who own the third largest proven oil reserves in the world.
In some cases US companies were disadvantaged because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to face risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry and who have been with technical advice in recent years have left out empty.
The Russian companies Lukail and Gazprom were the main actors on two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large parcels of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the oil minister's spokesman, Assam Jihad, that China is about to become one of the majors of the world economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure with its co-operators and fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
For the bid tax preselected companies, bids were made, which were then compared to the charge per barrel of oil that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase each field's emissions beyond the current level.
Top planner of the Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In the event of an obvious US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, this week, a top-level Al Kaida deployment planner was to have been killed, reports representatives of the US terrorist fight on Friday.
This would be, if it were confirmed, the second deadly attack on a highly responsible terrorist organisation this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs that according to US sources and Pakistani authorities of the region were to have been killed by a number of missiles that met their vehicle on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan’s lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle toward the Afghan border when the car was hit, said an official of a Pakistani civil intelligence service from Miran Shah by phone.
Local residents suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the site and quickly took everything left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. terrorist fight led to undetermined evidence that Somalia belonged to the dead.
Somalia was described as a leading military planner of the Al Kaida, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracys all over the world, noticed a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate character of American air attacks on Pakistani soil.
If one accepts his central role as given, this also included planning attacks against the USA and Europe.
He accepted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and implemented them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American government representative said that Somalia had risen rapidly in the Al-Kaida hierarchy and had the best links with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second official, but this does not reduce the danger he posed for us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somalia would be the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader who had been killed since September, when a similar attack by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed.
Since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, the pace of attacks by the CIA by drones has declined to two from an average of six operations per month, a website maintained by a non-profit organization.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups who have taken steps to reduce their attackability and brutally kill suspected informants at the same time, reported the page.
Leading UN Envoys in Kabul Will Decline
On Friday, the UN's leading envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said that he would withdraw from office in March, ending a stormy term of office that had been troubled by claims of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
Eide's departure took place when the Obama government decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the military increase, but he also expressed his concern that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal, which is due to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their armed forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help in Afghanistan's political transition.
The military increase must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not lay down his office, but only fulfilled an agreement against his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UN-
Forward Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now, so that he has time to provide a replacement.
What I said is that he better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has started looking for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has recently considered the Swedish-Italian-amended Staffan di Mistura, who led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and embezzling evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - who was fired - have undoubtedly harmed the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism about the international interference in the election.
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries who donate for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN settings undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is disastrous and must not go on like this.
US Defense Minister Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Minister of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in discussions about his nuclear plans.
During a 7-day journey through the war areas in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and played the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Iran has no good options to choose, he said in response to a soldier's question about the probability of such a development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years, which is self-predictability of war."
The Obama government is considering a sanction package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed, "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer enormously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion by the White House spokesperson, Robert Gibbs, the U.S. government has joined the European top politicians in warning that Iran has to expect "credible" consequences if its nuclear programme does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology is to be gained only for peaceful purposes.
During discussions in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume discussions on the limitation of its nuclear programme and give up a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has called for this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- partly, experts say because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
The fact that Iran had simply abandoned the international community in relation to some of the proposals that it had already agreed at the beginning of October, openly said that the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, brought together in a way that it had never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama set the 31st Dec as the time limit for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those called Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once "depressing sanctions".
In an opinion delivered in New York, Iranian representation at the United Nations condemned what it called "unfounded and unfounded claims" by some Security Council members on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are willing to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers to "get a suitable long-term solution".
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before joining the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, especially in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates pushed both sides to reduce the conflict potential to prevent delays in the US plans to reduce the American force from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to disperse Kurdish concern about the upcoming military withdrawal. US representatives quoted Gates, who went to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will receive your security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change in prices in the older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them talks that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave".
These lessons have taught them so well that as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly started changing course this summer due to the low birth rate and the ageing population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediately and finally, "No matter".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child there is nothing left, Wang said, 31, a head of staff with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notorically thick, secluded children, who are lovingly called "little emperor", a population crisis is rising in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time when this policy came into force, the UN-
Population survey, while the number of population from 60 years of age and older in 2020 is expected to rise from 16.70% of population to 31.1% of population by 2050, far above the global average of about 20%.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and elders made up almost 22 percent of the reported residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples have to get babies at a viable age to "help reduce the ratio of ageing population and reduce labour shortages of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial option that has been introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who violate this policy must expect enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese representatives have attributed this policy to the fact that the critical claim of natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of politics.
In rural areas, some officials who had already had a child have forced pregnant women to quit.
Many couples also had gender-selective abortions carried out, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many hard slogans was reduced.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University's Institute of Population Research, said that government representatives recently even discussed more radical changes, for example, to allow couples to allow two children in whom a partner is a single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city in July to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who is getting into question for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent out local staff and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and pass through information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outdoor areas of Shanghai said that there is a recovery in the requests of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, only four to five applications remain per month as an example.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births expected in 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Shanghai Congregation’s Family Planning Committee, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have children anymore.
They want to give her the best she can for her first time, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like two children and would also be allowed to do so legally.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance from the government.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
The problem, however, is not simply in one policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of staff, said that she wanted only one child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to care for each one of us.
We're not used to taking care of others and don't really want to do this either."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it inexorably.
For middle-aged parents with double careers by which the birth rate decreases, he said, it turns out to be successful and for that one must be selfish.
The age group of the 20-39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment, and they don't want such a life for themselves, he said.
Also a single child, he said, places enormous demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a CV for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this one time, Chen said, but not two times.
Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group drafts emission reduction plan
The UN-funded climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations -- once again focused on Friday with the publication of a document, which will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrial nations having to train the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, has identified both the remaining obstacles and the path forward.
But he was seen as important progress in a negotiation that is due to take place, as more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, which was formulated by a UN working group specifically designed for this purpose, goes against the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries in order to master global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of key issues options, including how industrial and large emerging markets can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of global temperature increase that policy makers would contribute to.
The process is given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, executive representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-sided document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the leading climate protection representative of the UN, Yvo de Boer, called "the great whole".
It shows the basic outline of a possible agreement in which industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given a boost to discussions on Friday through its commitment to spend over the next three years $3.6 billion a year to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change, from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday nevertheless brought the same verbal fireworks, which had determined the talks last week.
The American climate expert Todd Stern has rejected formulations that require binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if these are not financed by the industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama government was driving a tougher line with China, as representative of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging markets standing up and taking measures, so Star, who also complained that the text is not going far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his opinion one hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister He Yafei's statement that it was either "the reason" to the leading American climate negotiator or it was "highly irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not financially help master global warming.
The fact that the future economic march of the major world powers is at stake has broken down both within the industrialized nations and between the industrial nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle refers to the salvation of individual economies, as well as to the saving of the planet, where China and the United States are committed to their respective obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting who should bear the costs of braking greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have been more aggressive in bringing countries with a very high greenhouse gas levy to account for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic domination will develop, according to Ulate, who is also active as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are most exposed to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding contract in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will in the best case lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page contract on early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "is exerting political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand measures from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions had to be resolved before the government leaders arrived to reach agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, escaped their aircraft and rushed through the corridors of the Bella Center to meet behind closed doors and press conferences to stop claims negotiated during the next week.
The pure extent of the assembly -- 13,000 people enter the congress centre every day, guitar-playing activists organize night shows in which they make fun of the countries which, in their opinion, betray and sell themselves, and contract designs are passed by hand rather than by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all the major ministers are here now and from Wednesday will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km/h faster train defines the Monday feeling new
Monday morning at 5 a.m.13, a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train ride that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed gear train in the country will reach 225 km/h on its lightning ride from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and will be placed 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will be on board the first Javelin Pendant Service from London.
He hopes that the new service UK will finally connect faster, reliable trains to an international rail network and connect the large conurbation areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living commuting cities, working hours would be radically reduced, and the change from aircraft and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and traffic congestion.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds required for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and concerns about environmental damage could still pull the brake on the British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January, which is to provide the government with a feasibility study, will, according to the Times, submit the report on December 30.
As a result, it receives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which London is to connect with the West Midlands, will pass with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the open area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also intended to establish three options for a larger, north-east leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is an Y-shaped route that would lead a single high-speed line to the West Midlands.
The route would divide into or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another towards northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the journey time between London and Edinburgh would decrease to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travelers to return the route London-Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to today a little over an hour.
The drafts offered the trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first track was planned so that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in service on the London-Birmingham line per hour.
In turn, this would mean that London would require a terminal station on which 20,000 travellers could be made per hour.
Given the spatial limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be developed to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
First, the trains would have to switch from high-speed trains to existing railways in northern Birmingham, which would keep the journey time between London and Scotland for over three hours.
This is considered to be a crucial bang point in order to ensure a change from aircraft to rail, a measure of the rail revolution.
Tax payers for mortgages for 75,000 pound orangeration of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading sub-house member of the Conservatives, has charged the taxpayer with thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an orangery that he built in his residential building in his constituency.
The prison speaker of the party, who was degraded by David Cameron, because he complained that underhouse members must live "from lean ratios", has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to build up an oak factory building at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The officers of the Unterhaus approved the requests at the time, and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Leggen, who carried out a review of the expenditures of the Unterhaus members. Last night Duncan said that the requests could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest underhouse members, has a two-storey house in a village in his constituency Rutland and Melton.
Houses nearby have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control unit of the underhouse, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden called "Orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "Glasshouse for Entertainment".
During a recent investigation of its previous mortgage contracts by the Committee for Standards and Privileges, Duncan was not invited to submit an opinion on increased funding.
The Committee has released it last month after an examination of its expenditure from breaking the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage over 271.406 pounds (30.000 euros) from his London house to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election as a member of Parliament.
This week published documents show that Duncan received approximately 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as mortgage interest by March last year.
In April his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, which suggests that the total increase to finance the collection of 75.000 pounds (85,000 euros) was used.
The normal stepless RBS mortgage interest fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the Unterhaus show that Duncan continued to assert his entitlement to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his post in September as opposition leader of the Unterhaus after an undercover reporter filmed him as he said after the spending scandal that Members would live "from leaner ratios".
"In essence, if you work for the state, you have to live on lean ratios and be treated like S*****e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden, and I am entitled to a small part that disappears, as measured by what belongs to it.
And I could have demanded the whole fucking sum, but I'm not doing it."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his former career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked the first time in May because of his spending, when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before he had concluded with the Fees Office that this could be "exaggerated demand".
As a protest in Duncan's lawn, an activist dug a hole in the form of a pound mark, after having become aware that he had demanded 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said: "This was approved by both the Fees Office and the subsequent award of the value increase."
He added: "There is no debate about avoiding and passing through or bending the rules or similar.
Everything is fully transparent and is strictly moving within the rules, approved and everything.
It could not even be cleaner and clearer."
Come all your believers to admire Brighton's beach cottages Advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that stimulates spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts as a theme for every December with Christmas songs.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the newest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dried fruit pastries.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I save three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the tent decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary clergyman of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize enthusiastic celebrations.
The idea of the beach cottage Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide on Saturday and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and mandatory agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have taken several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people according to police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers, have been marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which should lead to a conclusion that could enter into force from 2013 onwards.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the Climate Change Conference, increasing mobility in the world for the climate is contributing to what is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, had broken the window with patchstones and hammers, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-distress police have intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that, according to your assessment, 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, were arrested in the east of France, in April, of these extremely violent splitter groups, who had already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has been severely criticised by the conditions under which hundreds of militants had been arrested "without distinction", and has stressed that about a hundred of you "were kept still in the streets on Saturday night", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in seat position.
The rather peaceful train has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without an attempt to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the appointed spokesman for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators have arrived with bunches and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans were present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue rain coats, have made a first run-up in the morning in Copenhagen, as you followed the call of friends of the earth to form "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a reparation of the ecological debt to the south, said Lidy Nacpil, Phillipin activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot go on and say: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, streams where you can walk, as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organisations.
European member José Bové, the figure of globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the struggle for another world."
The Asian Pacific area, where many islands are located, which are particularly vulnerable as a result of warming, has given the launch shot for the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people have gone to the streets.
In Manila, there were several hundred people, mostly students who were marched in red and hated Bandanas, where you famous the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the '350 network' have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (Northern), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected his president to denounce Georgia that it is a "mighty" here.
Abkhazia elected his president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilissi denounced the "Streich".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election following the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South-Ossian territory, another Georgian secessionist area recognized by Russia.
The pick-up halls closed GMT at 5 p.m.
The electoral participation was about 58% a few hours before the election meeting, according to the Abkhasian electoral commissioner.
The first results should be announced at night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the former president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of a reunification with Georgia that condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under a certain total occupation, has declared his press speaker, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After being separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, several thousand people died, Abkhazia wishes to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have elected Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the constituencies who went to choose from a school in the capital of Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian President and the head of government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abchasian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as a reference to Moscow's support, especially with regard to the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, replied and raised a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements made with Moscow last year, as the one in Abkhazia left Russia to control the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims neither to support the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding contract from the Koophagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready for intervention, arrested about 700 people, on the edge of an important demonstration.
According to police, thirty thousand people, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers, have demonstrated in the afternoon colds in the Danish capital, which until December 18th, welcomes delegates from 193 countries who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to penetrate.
A stage was set up to welcome the appointed spokesman for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators dressed in black and armed with brick and hammers began to take slices, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-unrest police immediately surrounded you and intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the floor.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people were arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent dividers, which have already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, during the incidents in which the police arrested about twenty people for the time being, the police suffered injury to the chin by a patchstone. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We've got the extreme groups under control," said the police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces were airing.
Most of the demonstrators who were arriving by train or with their own vehicle from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan, were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of "Friends of the Earth" to be a first group to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are going to the road to demand that the ecological debts be paid back to the people of the South," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say more: we still have time," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that forge, there are streams through which you can run, which was never the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the globalists has approached environmental protection organisations.
The French parliamentarian and global critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer any difference between the fight against global warming and the struggle for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilised several personalities, such as the Danish Model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turned to the masses.
The Asian Pacific region, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given rise to the demonstrations.
In Australia about 50,000 people have gone to the streets according to the words of the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed red with Bandanas, made advertising for solar energy before the city administration of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred persons, especially Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east, joined together during the demonstrations organized by the 350 network.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge from the school reform of the Lycées.
In an interview, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", national education minister Luc Chatel stated that the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycées, even if they are not taught in the terminals (12th year).
"The students of the Première (11st year of school) now have every four weeks and the same program," confirmed Mr. Chatel.
For the minister "must be overcome this hypocrisy", because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but a concentration "the best student."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific", he continued. He stressed: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lyceen."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticise the government project to delete compulsory teaching in history and geography in the terminals S (12th year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also complained about this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the rights.
The Minister replied that there was no question about limiting the philosophy of the programme of terminals S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which in their opinion the education of future teachers is a victim.
The Minister stated that they were in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year in a professional qualification examination and at the end of the year of an approval examination, in which their teaching skills were examined.
In addition, they perform internships during the year in M2 and then teach a year before the students as a teacher in the internship.
He continued to say: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance examination, you can reach even more hours you spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "state that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed once again that he wanted to cancel the "up to 2012" school card.
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normal Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the commitment at the Copenhagen Summit : this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to deal with on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normal Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, where experts each turn to the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
One wants to do something to reach people and in them the feeling of wanting to learn more, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference, explained. The name of this event goes back to the name the students gave to the fishes in the school bass.
"Among the experts were selected around twenty participants, even after their charisma," he explains.
"You can talk about climate warming for hours, but the core goals can also be set in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke freely only with the help of films before about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the audience might draw from the fact that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be on the page of the school from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Payment delay : angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the unions of criminal execution officials called on a general day of action to achieve that the premiums and overtimes whose payment was suspended for budget reasons by January are transferred before Christmas holidays.
The second union of criminal enforcement officers ("FO-Pénitentiaire") called on the employees who have no service to demonstrate and block them from the criminal execution centre on Tuesday morning in order to draw attention to the "theft of what is due them".
The 3rd union of criminal enforcement officers ("CGT Pénitentiaire") called for the "to unite into a strong mobilization in the various prisons" on which the non-payment of overtimes, night supplements and the sun and holiday supplements in December is being "injurious and unacceptable".
The first union of criminal execution officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called on "general mobilizations (...) to demonstrate discontent and anger."
The management of the criminal execution agency and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime has risen significantly in 2009 and not all of them have been planned in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of criminal enforcement officials in which it guarantees that payment will be made next month.
"I know very well about staff's efforts to maintain and modernise our criminal enforcement system," the Minister of Justice informs in this letter.
"I have instructed the management of the criminal execution agency to take immediate action to ensure that such a situation, which was created by lack of assessment of the overtime, does not repeat itself in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore lower, except for managers who benefit from high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains for whom the "budgetary constraints" have to be met.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO in Marseille urges and announces that "all meetings and convenings" boycotts up to new instructions.
"The staff is not working on Sundays and holidays, if the hours of October are still not paid in December. This also applies to their overtimes", the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being devoted to us without more staff being set up, the attempt to enrich itself to the staff's funds is more than inappropriate," the Bordeaux CGT association.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is unfair, states the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he always distributes Christmas gifts better than he gets himself.
The American President, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has laid off with the TV-talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he always distributes better gifts than he gets himself.
During a special mission broadcast on Sunday evening via the ABC canal, the president and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus loves Bo too," says Michelle Obama, adding that the dog of course also gets a gift.
Michelle Obama rejected her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she nodded the president.
"So please," he conjured them up and pointed out to the pearl chain of the First Lady: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour broadcast in a casual atmosphere with the well-known TV moderator who supported Barack Obama so vehemently during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they had most loved as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten courses and also a basketball that his father, whom he saw very rarely, had brought to Kenya at Christmas.
"I remember when my father once visited us at Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the President.
"A lot later in my life, I understood that I had this ball of him."
First Lady remembered her doll house.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday is re-operating, RTL confirms that he has been put into artificial coma.
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles because of significant "harms" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation is "under control" although RTL confirms that the singer was moved into the artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was again operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors had found "damages caused by the operation of a tape disc incident" he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damage had required a new operation.
Nevertheless, the singer's production company wanted to make it clear that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was moved to an artificial coma to avoid "smarts and complications".
However, it was only after 48 hours that you had a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he opened the eyes, that RTL added.
At the request of the AFP there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources" that after his first operation in Paris, "no kind of drought" was laid.
The rocker had been operated at Parc Monceau International Hospital because of a disc incident.
The surgery planned for several days was undertaken by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments to RTL.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was sent to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, was of the opinion to RTL on Thursday that his friend is going through a "deep valley". However, he assured that one needs "no worry" to make the rock musician, since this is "a good fighter".
"He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles. I told him it was nonsense to put himself in an airplane for twelve hours after such an operation," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "react well to antibiotics" and that "the infection is inhibited".
Mr. Camus also said that he spoke to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he did not feel any special concern.
Nevertheless, the concern about the health of the singer has increased since he was hospitalized for nine days in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, there was general amazement that Johnny Hallyday had a "small intestinal cancer surgery", which resulted in a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented extensively on. Fans and journalists have not missed the fact that the singer has tried to move on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the surrounding persons had to demente a further delivery to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet over its favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, got an international title about its favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 at the Kurzbahn in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, on which the polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a true record flood was expected.
A record was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m positions of the gentlemen.
Shame for Bousquet, who wanted to grab the 50m freestyle after the world record, whose record he held in the large basin (20.94).
With one of the two royal distance in swimming, 50m-freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman in 20.53 sec, claimed. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually it is eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet defeated the Croat Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever bigger ones and in this case I have said when the world record is in my reach, I will try."
As Bousquet started almost all swimmers in polyurethane suits, which are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epos in Istanbul, which started the same competition for the first time in 1999.
The use of the combination has not paid off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time World Champion in the Becken this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has taken the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't win a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
United States : Burial plate at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman gravetop that appeared with the French writer Emile Zola was estimated to be $1.5 million on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the IIIth century after Christ and has always been rated at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysos are depicted in a socialist architectural decor surrounded by satyren and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world", said Florent Heintz, Vice President for the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday opposite the AFP.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is certainly what the buyers have so far offered most," says Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family at home, after which she appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her Paris hotel's bathroom and appeared at Paul Reynaud, Minister in the IIIrd French Republic and President of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the database of the Louvre, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of an "heir of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelayas exit attempt from Honduras direction Mexico has been terminated
On Thursday Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on domestic soil as no longer compatible, after this leadership had rejected as unacceptable by the coup government.
After a telephone call with President Zelaya at night, everything seems to indicate that one disagrees with the possibilities for the execution of this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, explained.
According to the immigration authority, the aircraft submitted by the Mexican government, which had arrived in Salvador for the purpose of transfer M. Zelayas, was returned to its place of departure on Wednesday.
The coup government wanted to ask M. Zelaya to "debt" and ask him abroad for political asylum under guidance.
However, the overthrown President refused to do so, since he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcome, official head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered a further failure by moving me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to give up," said Thursday M. Zelaya to Radio Globo, in which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has taken place in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here good and happy for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the overthrown president who had fled to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under attacks of some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has sent us a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, had explained on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the Putsch Government, to the Honduran Radio HRN.
I'm not looking for asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the Telesur channel, which is located in Caracas.
A possible exit from Honduras, he had underlined, would only be a president of the Honduran people.
On Wednesday, the rumors of an exit from M. Zelayas had mobilised the followers of the overthrown president who had taken up the Brazilian Embassy and gathered around it, and then the military there strengthened his efforts.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, revealed the marginal character of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, on the day of the People's Enquiry to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21, and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
He leaves it, is detained for high treasons, which he is accused of by the judicial authority, says the coup.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace M. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo had been recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, but was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argeninien or Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street in the upturn, the trade balance of the USA nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded with a high on Thursday, which shows the figures of the American trade balance of a price recovery of the U.S. shares and their partners: Dow Jones has increased by 0.67%, Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the numbers at market closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq in turn, which is dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended Index Standard & Poor 500 was credited with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from various sectors, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial judged.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market only focuses on "heavy glasses", so it decreased.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly fixed on the figures of the American trade balance, "which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $320.9 billion in October, compared with September.
In contrast, the analysts had expected deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The major innovation is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, reflecting the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of Enterprise Research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have increased against all expectations last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, during the last four weeks, the average value of new jobseekers was "falling at the low point of the year", said Scott Marcouiller by Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3,482% compared to 3,432% of Tuesday evening, the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4,492% compared to 4,408% of the evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans in power prun out "Dams in White"
On Thursday, several hundreds of Cuban-powered partisans sprang up the women gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day by political prisoners and also destroyed another rally, which temporarily arrested a good dozen dissidents.
Forty "Dams in White", wives or close political prisoners, were run on the open road by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on the footstep to the center of the Haupstadt in order to demand the liberation of political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Low with the Yankies!, "Söldner!", "The road belongs to the revolutionaries!", "It lives Fidel and Raul!", the authorized partisans, with raised fist, were in front of the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "guarantee this protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Dams in Weiss" had taken place on the eve of Havana, where neither the injured nor the arrests came.
On the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also took place at the demonstration held on Thursday in view of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civilians, confirmed a reporter of the AFP.
According to this journalist, the police forced the dissidents of the government to enter civil vehicles under violence.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Damen in Weiss" organized an unapproved march for the purpose of "Please release all political prisoners", the number of whom according to the dissident list has around 200 persons, Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda has been sentenced to 20 years in prison.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of the 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, of which 53 are behind bars until date.
The Cuban authorities consider the regiments to be "söldner" or "Agents" in the service of the declared arch enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events taking place on Thursday between militant pro-government coppers and "contra-revolutionary" reports.
The Cuba, led by a Communist Party, is regularly accused of imputing rights and freedoms by European or American NGOs, especially those of freedom of expression.
Insanity kills eighties with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A two-meter-armed madman killed an eighty-year-old on Friday against late afternoon at the main business time in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) and injured five more people.
According to the first information of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the 80-year-olds from previously unexplained cause in or before a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, police statements correspondingly, with witnesses present.
The old man, born in 1929, is, according to a police syndicate, Alliance in the hospital, subject to the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he was able to use a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the threeties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were severely injured to the hospital, where the 80-year-old died.
The other injured one floats in danger of life, since, according to police sources, apparently vital organs were affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and is said to have been hospitalized by a police source in the "shock state".
The armed man, who seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs according to police records, should immediately be removed from the road, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have hurt two more passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty- and a forty-year-old, the latter of both heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two carnivores, which he carried crossed behind his back, declared Arnaud Pressé, a responsible of the Syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passers-by passers-by, including young people, are supposed to have tried, according to the witnesses determined by the AFP, to bind the mad.
I saw a guy in the threes with a green vest.
Three young people tried to get involved.
They couldn't do it because the guy was well built, said Alberto, a waiter of a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city politician who broke his wrist.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jares, at the level of house number 61, two city police officers, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knives, so police information.
The event took place in one of Clichy-la-Garenne's main arteries, where a number of shops are located.
Passersby have come to me to tell me that an injured person is out there.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I brought her to first-aid position and noticed a clumsy wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty - year - old person came, was injured by cutting wounds.
The government police force has finally arrested the man who did not carry any identity papers.
Nanterre's prosecutor's office has commissioned the District Unit of Criminal Police from Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to clarify the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday evening.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard judicially.
A police source doesn't rule out he's being delivered to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers had to take him to the police commissioner in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of exasperation" like "all mentally confused people of this kind, in which the forces free themselves during the Tathergang".
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer calls again for prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly called on the prosecution of his clients who are currently in his place of residence in Switzerland on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to be brought to trial due to a death sentence over 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the pianist, accused three judges of the appeal court in the second district of California of gross procedural error during the trial period in 1977.
I demand punishment on the spot, M. Hummel explained before adding that the behavior of the judge's Laurence Rittenband at the time of the trial with the case was "run a cold back".
According to him, before he came to his judge's argument, the judge band - now dead - discussed with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski had earned a breeding house -- which represents a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been launched in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and disired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted) by David Wells.
At the end of September, M. Wells had finally declared that the authors of the documentary "belogene".
If the Court of Justice were to refuse to suspend the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel would demand the leadership of a process that would enable him to present the evidence for his argumentation.
On the other hand, the charge has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the lifting of the offences imposed on the defendant cannot be seriously considered, as long as Roman Polanski does not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, even before the denunciation of punishment for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor aged 13 years.
Since then, he has not traveled to the United States.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had explained that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants who are fleeing is a way out?, Mrs Asayma asks.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the Court of Justice for a favor and thereby despises its authority."
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to make their decision known – even highlighted that there are other flight-territoratives.
Hummel was not the only person who had requested the prosecution of Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also again demanded that the criminal proceedings be abolished.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear it to be harassed by any resurgence of the Affair Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years are enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on the occasion of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of any extradition.
Wall Street is slowed by the rise of the dollar and closed off without course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed off on Friday without a course in a market that was torn between better indicators than planned in the US and an increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, while Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final numbers available for closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 65.67 points to 10.471.5 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has given 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Index Standard & Poor's 500 has risen by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Surely, the market is quite quiet," Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management noted.
"He remains closely limited, the volume of trade has become very low, and I think that this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than intended to contribute "to improving the market view of the solidity of the recovery of the economy", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, i.e. two months in a row and much more than planned.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes were slowed down by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level of the euro for two months, thus pushing down the sectors affected by the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost something on the ground.
The bond market has declined.
The return on the treasure bond for over 10 years has risen by 3,540% on Wednesday evening compared with 3,482% and the bond for over 30 years to 4,497% on 4,492% of the previous day.
Choice of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of tour through South Africa, the 112 candidates to the title of Miss World on Saturday will go beyond the last obstacle to realize their dream: to be elected as the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this before a billion television viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already got their ticket to the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were selected during their African stay to Miss Sportive or also Miss Topmodel.
This was a true sweater of pleasures.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, was simply extraordinary.
I have seen many things and have had lots of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, from 5 p.m. to 5 p.m.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have done this experience twice, underline Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the re-covery of "breathing landscapes".
After a month of Galas, samples, meetings with the press and Safari, the Miss is now focusing on the competition.
Inderin Pooja Chopra hopes to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, and to rehearse Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both Bollywoodstars were chosen.
Of course, it is the dream of every woman to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but this is not just about the appearance.
We are ambassadors to our country and I would like to come home with the crown, and Miss India throws in a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defil in traditional costumes and not forget to swim in the suit.
The performance is presented by a television moderator, Chinese Angela Chow, the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and by a responsible member of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with a warmness and pride that is hardly to be surpassed, assures Julia Morley, chairman of Miss World.
Like last year, the candidates have made a safari that visits the famous township in Soweto, but this time they have taken a bicycle and local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them his hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not usually for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noticed.
Her most beautiful memory, however, remains the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise a little more for this event.
I'm wrong with people I'm probably never able to approach.
I am sure to return to the 2010 World Cup, enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
According to his son David, the news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", his son David assured on Friday on his arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father who has been in hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything goes very well, explained David Hallyday to the press when he left the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 1 p.m. local time (MEZ) from Paris.
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would go "fastest" to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was sent to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after an operation.
The singer was moved "this night in Los Angeles into an artificial coma to relieve his severe pain and carry out his treatment, announced the press service.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma by doctors from Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was sent to Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection after a tape disc operation.
The singer had to undergo surgery at night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the diseased changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia attended a school on Friday morning at the French gymnasium in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade attends school, a photographer of the AFP noted.
The head of the Department of Orthopedic and Traumatological Surgery at Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer has heavily burdened neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer on 26 November in the Clinique internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told he'd done the purest massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely disarmed, Mr. Camus.
I've heard of the possibility of initiating court proceedings, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "was traveled to Los Angeles with the permission of the Paris surgeon."
I personally telephoned with this doctor who assured me that he looked at this trip as totally unproblematic, which I had been very surprised because I already had two tape disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced at RTL that the singer would apparently have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artist environment.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a haematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with dubious reputation, who has been condemned several times because of misconceptional operations and not to forget about tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the medical board, referred to him as "a man without skrupel" who has to "regularly" before the board of directors and is "all but recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He said the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "called out no bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been in question since the last summer.
It is clear that it is somewhat too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), said Mr. Camus.
The UDF Party Alliance (Union for French Democracy) is becoming energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre Party to stop using its seals.
The party alliance, which is monitored by François Bayrou's MoDem party, has strongly responded on Friday to a takeover attempt by the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from the chairman of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin party, and, under the threat of a judicial persecution, has asked him not to use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political heritage after he had reached the left hand.
By the way, the Minister of Defense, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In response to his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now NC) who has acquired a right to ownership of the UDF brand, as he first applied for this brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industrie".
However, the office of the UDF party alliance monitored by François Bayrous' friends broke the silence and clearly understood that they did not dispossess themselves and, under threat of a judicial persecution, set a deadline to stop using this seal and transfer the ownership rights of the mark to the minister and to the Member.
In recent days you have made numerous statements that you would propose to take over your political movement the UDF seal+, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
They also believed that you had the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today's UDF +, on their political material and on the website of your website.
As you know, you do not have the right to use this seal, the office of UDF declared and asked the NC party to "remove the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (their) website".
Furthermore, it was demanded by Hervé de Charette to transfer the ownership rights of the brand to their legal right to claim ".
If you refuse this, we will sue you in order to respect the law and defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatory warned.
In their letter they stress that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and reminds us that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" to leave them in 2007 to establish a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to establish the party "UMP".
The Nouveau centre party therefore has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocracy française) according to the signatory.
They continue to recall that the last Congress of UDF 2007 adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a department for the defence of "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "at the time he applied for the brand name, he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years" but the UMP.
In scandalous and fraudulent way, it benefits from the lack of the deposit of the acronym UDF in order to carry out this for itself.
In addition, you give consideration to the fact that this carelessness is the best way to turn into a crime and ironize the strategy of the NC: "It seems more desirable to us in politics as well as in life to make ourselves a name instead of trying to get out of the anonymity, by cheating on a name to which you have no legal claims."
Affaire Liliane Bedncourt : François-Marie Banier is condemned for exploiting weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he has exploited a weak moment of eighties in order to swallow up some of their assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photos, will have to answer for the exploitation of weakness in court on 15 and 16 April 2010, a criminal offence that will be punished with a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that in fact there will be a process in this affair worthy of the Saga of one of the richest families in France in which mother and daughter fatten themselves and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal in hand.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bedtcourt, which is jointly conducted by three doctors.
L'Oréal's heir and main shareholder has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions submitted by Nanterre's prosecutorate during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday should present a report before 10 March 2010 in which you will make it clear whether and at what times Liliane Bettcourt may have found itself in a state of weakness.
I think she'll undergo these investigations.
I'm going to talk to her, Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me George's Kiejman, after the trial.
As for the lawyer of Françoise Bettcourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent novelty (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady you need to protect, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has launched a criminal action against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother's weakness for years in order to swallow donations of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettcourt had always been opposed to being manipulated by the photographer she sees as a longtime friend.
Although the court had to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, on Friday the lawyers' plaidoyers led to a large family debacle.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettcourt has called on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she was wrong with the husband of Françoise Bettcourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettcourt added the following: "Please tell my daughter that I have written to Banier for fifteen years, one to twice a day.
I have never been able to speak since her marriage."
The public prosecutor's office of Nanterre is again of the opinion that the applicant had no right to respond in this way, especially because a guardian in the last few days rejected her request to initiate judicial proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bedtcourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no guardianship.
No one has the right to act in their place," the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney, confirmed.
The court has now decided to give a judgment after the process of admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager's Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes to the leadership of the big French companies has been our struggle for the development of economic intelligence for nothing ...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in terms of its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is for personnel to join "values" determines the best as it used to be designed on consumer products by the technicians in the factory.
By giving the customer the focus of the companies the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although authoritarian temptation products separate factors prefer to impose customer preferences regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralisation.
The suicide at France Telecom, PSA or Renault is only the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects especially employees.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R&D, which is even more crucial, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) calls for "a proactive approach and a forward-looking view of all parties involved"; it claims from the employees a commitment that fully contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution, which would be to place employees at the centre of the company's concerns with equal rights next to its customers.
The very related benefits of internal opinion polls
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire that Orange has submitted to its wage-earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practices?
I'm afraid I'm not.
First of all, because I was able to find that the whole structure, in the face of a new situation after many trajectorys, finally came to do primarily what it's always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - is increasing proportionally to the meaning of its own failures.
And finally, because most executives have a highly simplified idea of human behavior.
Her interpretation of psychology is mechanical from the major engineering schools.
By intellectual comfort they take over the old behaviorist theory, which was recently reactivated by the American "Neurosciences" and unknowingly widespread by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to activate the "Hebel" (sic) to the commitment of employees, a recent Le Figaro.fr survey by Ipsos strengthens the executives in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is inappropriate for today's world.
Identifying and measuring the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into any thinking or practice of governance: for the employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clear to be a means to realize part of their dreams, ambition and projects.
Currently, the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of the motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their business on the basis of a given doxa, which allows them to assess what it provides to them in order to achieve their goals of life.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and predict their "social performance" and relocate their human resource management in the right place.
In this way they create a fertile soil that is beneficial for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The Oslo speech: the "right war" brings Obama praise from the right
The American rights welcomed the speech held by Barack Obama on the eve of Oslo and were pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "righteous war" against the enemies of the United States in 2009.
The conservatives who had ridiculed the award to Obama on 9 October appealed this time to the President's speech, following the example of the former Vice-President candidate in the 2008 elections Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily USA Today and added that she had made use of the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in her recently published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of force on Thursday in Oslo; one way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, argued that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I felt that the speech was really good, congratulated the former president of the House of Representatives, who in particular recognized the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts I felt that this speech was completely historical, Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio show "The Takeaway".
The previous Member, considered by some as possible candidate for the Republican nomination of the 2012 presidential election, said that he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that "they could not be free and give a price for peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama kept "a very American speech."
In addition to being a "cosmopolit", how "he always does it", he said, "as an American president," when he pointed out that the Europeans "live as in a security bubble they did not create themselves and for their protection they do not do much," says Gerson.
Among the few, unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a falke of the era Bush, referred to the speech on the National Review Online website as "drowsy, night long and inspiring".
On the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the use of armed forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, the massacre can be simply justified by the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left continues to praise the President's side.
The Los Angeles Times, still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize has been awarded early to Obama, described the address itself as a speaker like him who is known for his talent as a "Monumental Work".
The speech in Oslo "provides a timetable for managing international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," says the California daily newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama announced "the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "a dark and exemplary one at the same time".
Remote driver: Three marathons for an agreement that ensures the provision for Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the street association and TLF - the only employer organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that would put an end to the strike warrant and the threatening heavy supply passport at Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, the State Secretary Dominique Bussereau welcomed the agreement that was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiating parties separated on early Friday morning in the hope of rapidly signing the agreement on the late morning.
And that even though the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, it took more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 until the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was signed at 6:00 a.m.
The conflict "has caused a great deal of damage to the company" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," says Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages thus increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not a lot, but we're starting small first," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed not to block the supply centres anymore.
"However, there will probably always be some contradictions that are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement" although "it was difficult to grant these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for employees," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke of "an acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for an increase of 3% in travel costs and the maintenance of the total road transport activity in the first half of 2010, which will in particular allow for the issue of 13 months' salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the sinking of charges for employers amounting to EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the draft law of the corrected finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to be first applicable to the undertakings associated with this organisation, and subsequently applies to the entire profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", assures Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR association advocated "misleading trade" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate a part of carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but in order not to deceive the Gans-Esser on the coming Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre association, the agreement " threatens to raise a large grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry over the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disorders this weekend, trade unions with the RATP proposals dissatisfied
The disturbances on line RER A, the largest high-speed network in France for the Greater Paris and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second day of strike between the trade unions and the management of RATP (independent Paris passenger transport management), which allows strikers to continue with their demands for wage supplements.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central line was ready for use only one of four trains.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced passengers to change.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the big business in traffic".
The line RER A runs through the Paris conurbation room from west to east.
The RATP section connects Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains was scheduled for the main transport period, and almost no one was operating during the low-traffic time.
As on Thursday, there was no sense of well-being on the railways, as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less run than usual, especially because of the lack of gymnasiasts.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), stated that he would have "a half hours earlier risen to work on time".
The SNCF, who had planned to care for travellers by staff and officers, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at the Saint-Lazare railway station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on line RER A or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or drove off the Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the general meetings of the strikers took place, during which the results of the meetings were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "Truffty" after the meeting with the leaders on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for line RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career careers, etc.
But that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-term wage supplement.
The CGT was indignant that RATP itself put its wage supplement proposals in parentheses and stressed that the leadership "is unable to solve a problem, while this was also possible with the remoters and SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a renewed meeting on "the comprehensive examination of working conditions" for Monday was planned.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend riders".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leader who had refused any discussion during the strike, and had suggested a meeting after a calming up of the situation.
On Tuesday the conflict threatened to extend to the line RER B after an announcement of Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage supplement of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euro are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants), and complains that the working conditions on this route are deteriorated, on which millions of travellers travel on a daily basis.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, cover a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a wage supplement of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court resolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the resolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party; a decision following the immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the government's work very difficult, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have taken place for 25 years.
The "Participation for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "Citizen for activities which are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", according to the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, whereby a majority of seven votes would have been necessary to impose the resolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the leadership of the party, including the chairman Ahmet Türk and the parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political events for the duration of five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the withdrawal of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The party leaders expressed themselves before the verdict that the parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament rather than meet partyless parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "wiss" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which was considered terrorist by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no connection with the PKK, but refuses to describe it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The decision of the Constitutional Court is based on the Government's intention to meet the Kurdish Community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to make the PKK supported by the Kurds available and to put an end to the conflicts.
The DTP leaders reaffirmed that a resolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP premises in the million city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is mostly populated by Kurds.
The order forces used tear gas grenades and aquifers when the demonstrators began to throw Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the ruling, Turk assumed that the decision of the Court of First Instance "will further deepen despair".
"Turkish cannot clarify this question (Kurdish, e.g. editorial) on the basis of the ban of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose the closing of the parties on principle.
This does not solve the problems," said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a pedigree of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously focus on a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK was known for an attack that had killed seven soldiers in the north of Turkey three days earlier. This was one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really cracky winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the FES winter service manager.
In particular, his employees are able to try out and master the entire vehicle technology.
This weekend, according to meteorologists, it could be so far for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES proceeds according to an accurate plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A routes are removed with large-scale vehicles, Brauburger explains.
This includes major traffic and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire-repellent accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with pitfalls, such as Atzelbergstraße.
FES's service starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which is better liable.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until the career starts".
It's gonna be hard to snow until 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then nobody is willing to put the scatter vehicles in place."
Only after that, if it does not snow further, are supply and development roads, including the Council-Beil-Straße, on the line.
The last priority are side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the foot population of the FES is on the way, the danger points and transitions are cleared primarily.
The FES usually cannot take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which will keep an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30 hrs, says Brauburger.
Since there is on this fast smooth, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatterer is on the way.
If necessary, this is also called by the police.
The Cradle of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two-metre-long and 1,50-meter-large animal ran on two strong hind legs, had a long skull with sharp, bent teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was in a dry zone of the Supercontinent Pangea at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationship, the spread and the characteristics of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaurs on a day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as new species.
During the excavation they carried together the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino Early History
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary discovery: "Dinosaurier fossils from the trias are extremely rare, usually only single fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
The dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago, according to the current teaching opinion.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these Ur-Dinos is usually controversial.
For example, the experts debated when the exes split into their three main development lines: the carnivorous Theroodes, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-legged Sauroods known as "long-legged" and their relatives, and the plants eating Ornithicia (birds' saurers), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original Theropode.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air bags, such as the descendants of the Theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge sauropods later also had airbags and lightweight-building buds, probably the common ancestors of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers followed that the waxes appeared there for the first time.
As a result, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America across all parts of the earth, which were still a single land mass as a supercontinent Pangäa.
The fact is that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related Theropods.
The three cannot be derived from a common, immigrated ancestors, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course there are also contradictions.
An older kind, Silesaurus, who belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn's paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be distorted, because in South America, very many primitive Dino fossils have been preserved, while on other continents little can be found.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile strain to the dominant agricultural vertebrates of the ground middle age, is still mysterious.
During the trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flight cleaners and with numerous other echoes.
Towards the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relationship on the border from the Trias to the Jura died.
Success History Not Forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs happened to survive, but not the other reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact of a group of animals began to blossom, which had also developed in the trias, and since then a shadow was set for a time: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatory is international.
Professors at the University of Toronto, University of Cambridge, University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police rooming of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe University strikes waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers of Goethe University, but also of universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, work with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "miss" the police action initiated by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had cleared the building occupied by students and lecturers in the education strike last week because walls and works of art had been soiled.
Five students were injured.
The property damages, judged by the signatorys, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organised courses of students and teachers by a police command".
The room is an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism is "the deligitimization and criminalisation of the protest" and diverts from the contents.
The Bureau removed the necessary discourse.
The lecturers demand the immediate attitude of criminal persecution.
The majority of the representatives did not support the damage to property, it says.
Protest legitimised
The youth of Verdi and the German trade union association also work together with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for their own future, says Verdi-Landesjugend Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of the UN President and the police.
We are grateful to the UN President.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in Wiesbaden.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, says CDU Landtagsdepartment Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition fractions SPD, Green and Left saw that.
The CDU takes painted walls to the pretext to criminalise the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, one has cleared.
The Left has submitted a request asking the Interior Minister to report on police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years she was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of Moscow's capital city, was a strictly guarded location for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, the municipality is considered as a "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
As early as September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had established contacts with the Riedberg University Institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol on closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow's Vice Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed planning secretary Edwin Schwarz for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized companies will travel to Selenograd in the scientific research center for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It's about a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ's companies will be able to take foot on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to take orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the major companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for armaments research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Grunstadt") received its name from the wooded hill landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgarter Brakeklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
The project's supporters are simply about "the new heart of Europe".
Right so. S21 is much more than laying down a train station, more than a monotonous construction project that will overthrow the city of the Baden-Wuerttemberg state capital for a decade in healing site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was created from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were considered to be 19th century traffic fossils, which functioned like brakes of modern rail transport, since it once took a lot of time to transform locomotives from the back to the front.
Enter, hold on, drive on - that's how it's supposed to go.
And that's why the headquarters should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is about half-way from the trans-European rail station between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "Herz Europa".
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s have long been no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that in the Hessian and the Bavarian capital, it is almost innumerable to implement deep laying.
However, head stations have no entry and exit problems, since there are modern turning trains with motor vehicles and vans at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 along with the ICE-Neubaubahn to Ulm is now approaching.
National and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway is also involved because the risks of the largest infrastructure single project of the Republic of the taxpayers and not the state group are involved.
The project can still be justified by urban planning.
New urban space is being created, which - believe to be the computer-generated graphics of planners - is equipped with lots of greenery.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger transport, to which - typically 80s - huge growth was attributed.
At that time there was not the competition of the cheap flyers.
However, modern transport policy must first strengthen freight transport, as transport on the rail is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new construction line is not suitable for freight trains because of severe climbs.
Even much more serious is that S21 also indirectly tantamounts many other railway projects.
About six billion euros are to be ravaged in the Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is true that in the next decade, money will be missing at other nodes and narrow points on the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180 km long route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, the route has been built at the slow pace of time.
There would be an urgent need to push the tube right here.
However, S21 will act as a brake blower.
The Rhine valley line becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on the airport
The State Government has left it open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will go into revision against the judgment of the Hessische Verwaltungsgerichtshof (VGH) to the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to examine the more than 400-page VGH judgment in a judicial manner, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
On this day, the VGH in Kassel had stated in writing that, in the case of the construction of the planned north-west runway in Frankfurt Airport, the country had to redefine the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hrs, as provided for by the State Government, should not be compatible with the legal protection of the population from night noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is going against the judgment in revision.
The opposition criticised this delay and urged the representatives of the government to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD Group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promises to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this would be to be regarded as a "breakout".
It's fucking hard if you can keep your word, Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in reference to the FDP election slogan "We keep word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's accusation that the state government is trying to get to their night flights with "legitimate distortion and trickery".
A precise legal examination takes their time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally secure compensation, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, his group's statements on the night flight ban would never have been.
US banks pay back help
The crisis-shattered U.S. big banks strip off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the assistance from the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund of a total of 45 billion dollars (about 30 billion euros) to one hit.
Also, according to a report by the US-Sender CNBC, the Citigroup plans to refund state aid.
The institutions therefore want to eliminate the restrictions which have come with the adoption of the money, such as the restriction on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had bought up good $19 billion of fresh money from investors over change bonds.
The rest of the sum she took from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by savings sales.
On Wednesday evening, bank manager Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer: the cash injection helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had risen to the climax of the financial crisis with the takeover of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also intends to obtain money in the capital market in order to exempt itself from its liabilities to the State.
Already on Thursday, the US Bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, reported CNBC calling on circles.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to comment.
In June Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick Choice
Everything went faster than thought.
About two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors pushed out of office the official chief editor Nikolaus Brender, the sender can present a successor.
Last night the panel wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF Capital Studio in Berlin, was a favorite.
However, there was no confirmation from the sender - officially not to use the procedure.
However, a role should also have been played by the Board of Directors to avoid further damage to ZDF instructors Markus Schächter.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The result of the vote was not yet known with the closing of the editorial document.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke for Brender, seven vote against him. Brender's election was a deplorable defeat for the injured, but an expected one.
For the majority of the Union's Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election not to want to confirm Brender in office.
The resistance had been organized against the editor-in-chief of Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that the ZDF's messages had lost to switching rates under Brender, he refused another term of office of the senior editor.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was appalled.
Finally, even 35 national judges had interfered in the debate, which considered Koch's approach to be unconstitutional.
It didn't make sense.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education and romance.
After that he worked at the southwest radio and the Frankfurt Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to "today-journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988-1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morgenmagazine"; until 2001 head of the ZDF Foreign Policy; since then head of the ZDF Capital Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the election of Brenders, who was still elected by the Media Magazine Industry magazine on Wednesday.
Koch's opposition to the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Pfalzian Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that countries should change the ZDF Treaty in such a way that staff proposals from the Intendant cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also ruled out an exodus of party politicians from the ZDF's supervisory bodies.
Brender's expected successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a clever move of chess by strongly criticizing the panel immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate him without loss of face for the position of the editor-in-chief as well as to elect the Board of Directors without suspecting that he would hire a partygoer.
In the party arithmetics, Frey is in any case attributed to the left-liberal.
Study is being cleared up
Participation for students: After one year of the education strike, the Ministers of Culture of the Countries finally agreed on Thursday: At a meeting of Ministers of Culture and University Rectors, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelors and Masters.
Students should in future be able to cope with their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module should only complete with a single examination.
In addition, the work load of students should be reviewed and "a realistic and reasonable measure" ensured.
Policymakers and universities also want to simplify recognition of exams between universities within and outside of Germany.
Countries committed to making common structural provisions for Bachelor and Master's degree programmes more flexible.
Moreover, different national regulations should not exist.
Reduced testing
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Minister of Culture and University Rectors have carried the winged word of improved studyability in their mouth.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to cut the number of tests dramatically: "Every module usually closes with just one examination," it says in a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially reorganise the approval of study programmes.
With "the clear reduction in the burden of examination," said Reinhold Grimm, Accreditation Board Chairman, "the aim is to ensure a "feel development stop which significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, "studentability" will in future be "the crucial criterion" in design.
Modules such as content are "hard to check" whether "unnecessary statements of the students in the choice of the
It would be avoided.
The students would have "proclaimed to obtain games spaces that enable and promote their own initiative".
The rules are intended to apply to the approval of new programmes, but also to the review of existing programmes.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – however, which means that it will last until 2015 until all studies have been reviewed.
To this end, ten accreditation agencies are responsible throughout the country, which are subject to the Accreditation Council set up by the countries.
The Ministers of Culture had asked the countries in October "with emphasis" to work on the agencies so that the filling of substances is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and universities have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rheinland-Pfalz has offered additional resources for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, universities are mainly to set up Tutor programmes and to strengthen study advice as well as exams and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend 10 million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a novel of higher education law to Parliament.
After this, only a single examination should be required to complete a study model.
The aim of the study is to become more flexible, to ensure recognition of performance at other universities and to facilitate access to the master.
By the end of next year, all study programmes in the country will be reviewed for their studyability.
Government and opposition had again fought on the study conditions in the country on Thursday.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of the Juso High School Groups demanded that the design of education policy no longer take place "outside closed doors" of the ministers and university directors.
At the latest, according to the educational strike, students should now also "speak a word" as concerned.
The future academics received support from the President of the University Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Winterhaard: "We need the students' experience," she said at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with whom the HRK advised about a joint reform paper.
The Education and Science Trade Union (GEW) did not go far enough overall: it calls for a legal claim for any graduate with a Bachelor's degree to allow access to a further master's degree course.
On the other hand, countries have to ensure that sufficient Master's degree courses are available for today's generation of Bachelor students tomorrow with the best possible study conditions, says GEW Chairman Andreas Keller.
Countries need to recruit significantly more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express themselves to a more open access to the Master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Entry into Germany and out of it is pretty almost no control..." is the beginning line of a poem by poet Werner Söllner, in which these in disturbing language facts address the arrival experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, Werner Söllner had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literature awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt Poetik lecture at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessische Literaturforum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
During a conference in Munich last Tuesday, he provided a significant extraterrestrial lookout for "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of her securitate files".
Söllner presented a statement in which he was in charge of Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, and his cooperation as IM for the Romanian intelligence service Securitate.
Together with some of the present, Söllner had received the German language prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had started sleekly, first in 1971.
I am, closed Söllner, "so someone who didn't fight for the Securitate's intimidation attempts."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
At the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literature scene and, in particular, the community of the German authors from Romania are shaken by a case that shows the abyss and devastation of a political system based on surveillance and sensibility.
Werner Söllner is, as far as you can say according to previous knowledge, not only perpetrators but also victims.
In his Securitate Act, IM Walter played a role, said after the confession of Söllner by literary scientist Michael Markel and pointed to the positive influence of IM Walter.
He had "caught him out" in all difficial points for him at the time, says Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's explanation was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, however, the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service is not surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate-Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July in time after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The persons concerned, as one may suspect, are speculated and in some cases probably also knew, which clear name is hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and even Walter.
Unlike the very process-proof view of the Stasi acts in this country, the handling of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
A systematic Enlightenment has been driven back and hindered in recent years.
A Birthler National Council on the revision of the Securitate Acts (CNSAS) was founded only in 1999, but the publication of the files has since been rather sloping.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the management of files.
According to the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, the influence of former securitate members in Romania is still very great, an interview in which a former Temesvar Securitate Chief spoke about the award winner abjectly.
She's got a psychosis, after all, she's only been interrogated once.
The infamation of power meant to be able to express itself in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly the case of Söllner, as often in connection with silent guilt, is linked to inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who has been hurt? The healthy response of the listeners to Söllner's confession makes us hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined rather by desire for knowledge than by debt and shame.
For the generation of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it's more than a footnote.
Champions League Satisfaction Supplement
It seemed as if there was just an extra piece of dressed outsider from a nice Christmas celebration on which a sports article manufacturer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the outfitter, rose a quarter of an hour after midnight to a well-known C-class.
The man with the distinctive glare let himself be chauffed because of his foreign city.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - alcohol wasn't in play at last, and the 55-year-old was not so much drunk before luck.
It's been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow's work will continue.
Or let's go right.
In the words of the Swiss, who had first committed three days earlier, "We have achieved the eighth finale", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "very important task" is ahead of Sunday.
Then it is important to repeat in Mainz the royal class performance in the league daily.
And to stop the already re-explained weaknesses after the fast three gates by Marica (5.), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Exploitation
The Champions League's Eighteen Final (Hinspiel 16/17. + 23/24 February/ Replay 9/10. + 16/17 March) is released in Nyon on December 18th.
So the joy over the full standing of the Babbel successor remained.
Not only with the supposed Saviour, who had given the insecured Stuttgart professionals confidence, commitment and joy of playing in the short time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths, and stopped them from being more courageous, Soulsklempner Gross explained the simple success recipe that was so sounding under Therapeut Babbel but had no effect anymore.
He designed a certain magic, admitted Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann, "if a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, thanks to his dynamics, had advanced to the best player in the place after weeks of injury, tried to describe the identified "phases" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the operation of the new superior: "He is a man who goes through and requires discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel, it had obviously failed.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns sports director Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs mainly constance.
Like Gross, players and managers were careful to overvalue the victory against a weakened and completely overwhelmed defense of Romanian guests.
They would have won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening came, gave Khedira to consider.
And Chief Sports Officer Horst Heldt warned that although a season goal was achieved, the other was still further away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That hero on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory, had not been there for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which in the form of a television interview of Torhüter Jens Lehmann, which was broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that make others and not Jens, Heldt countered the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had shown the management weakness of management and had decided to change the trainer's mind to the pressure of puberty fans.
Even that his free day had been removed after games, Lehmann valued as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disfavor.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure egoism", hero hurried back and announced consequences for the final man.
They won't be friends for life, the two forty years.
However, they agreed with everyone else that without the preparatory work by the disbanded coach team the playful and fiercely strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man also agreed with the plastic bag.
WM-Fight in heavy weight
Hitziges Duell in Bern: Again and again Kevin Johnson was provocating world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title after version of the WBC.
The Court ruled unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains box world champion in heavy weight.
The 38-year-old champion after version of the association WBC defeated Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday in Bern according to points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Before that, the Ukrainians had already won the World Championships WBO and WBC twice.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out with the K.o. that everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance sheet to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give up due to injuries.
He was the first to defeat Johnson in the 24th fight.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2,02-meter-large Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
The 11 centimetres of little Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, however, was constantly deprived of the blows of the world master, so that Klitschko could not decisively achieve his dangerous rights.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provocated Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had taken care of some vor the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as "poor zombie", who "nothing right".
When weighing, on Friday, the champion was forced to push Johnson's sunglasses off the nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After nearly four years of flight, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his "his" WBC belt, which he had to give up without a fight before.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the USA in his title defenses in September.
I just got one blow in this fight and I'm very good physically in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return into the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt of the WBA is worn by the Britishman David Haye, after he was able to dethrone the 2,13-metre-large Nikolai Walujev in November.
Haye had previously canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September in the summer.
It is said that its PhD company is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
Fall Kunduz
Frontalack from the Opposition: Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin has called defence minister Guttenberg a liar because of incorrect information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and left demand information from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to recent findings on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has supported a conscious deception.
The Minister said "the untruth" to the deadly bombardment of September on two fuel trains, said Green-Group chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday at the ARD news programme "Day show".
It's called that land-by-country: it's lied.
The order to kill had been issued in disregard of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had read to Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday it became known that the attack was not only a destruction of the abducted trucks, but also a target killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to Nato's investigation report, up to 142 people had been killed or injured by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
On Saturday, Green, SPD and Left, Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) asked to comment immediately before the Bundestag and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghanistan policy of the Federal Government - and whether chancellor, federal defense and intelligence have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green-Collegine Renate Künast demanded.
The government spokesperson Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The chancellor's office did not influence concrete operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, too, there had been doubts about the presentation of the Ministry of the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have correctly and fully informed about the reasons behind the tankloader attack.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and kept the Minister from providing sensitive details.
However, from the area of the two top officials, it was stated that they had even referred to several reports to the Ministry of Defense, including a two-sided document by the commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert has now asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeinestagszeitung".
He has not yet received an answer, it says.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this was clarified in the Bundestag's investigation committee, which intends to establish itself on Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see pictures and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental illness and drug noise, the boundaries between imagination and reality disappear.
As long as it happens in sleep, it's all right.
If we are in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we are free to give up the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, anyone who experiences dreamlike conditions in the wake, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is generally regarded as crazy or drugious in the modern Western world, at least as special.
But such pictures and voices do not only arise in the case of mental illness or in the rush of drugs.
Debt has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes make sure that the boundaries between dream, fool and reality fade.
Dream-like changed awareness states can occur in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case fools.
Even if triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystics Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of Carlos Castaneda, Shamanic rapture states, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or walnuts arise when the balance of the neuronal messenger substances of the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is debled and the interaction of various brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and awesome thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity has no more power over him
The connection between fool and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the wake of state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861 a "great similarity of Irresin with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, obscene formations, sensory illusions of such.
It's autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and quietschbunt.
The gravity has no more power over him, he floats on the ceiling of the room.
He feels a step.
Behind him winged devils with blood red, distorted fragments, tenacious.
They hunt him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Loud, evil voices crowned from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. rips two cables out of the stereo system, chews them to a blade and fastens them on a hook on the ceiling.
He rises up to a speaker and puts the blade around his neck.
Jump.
The slings are loosening.
It's supposed to be a teaching to you, yelling the voices in drum-reflective choir, "go to the hospital and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last one is two years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizopactive-paranoid psychosis, and he is manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I've experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The guilds are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in life, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can usually no longer distinguish between indoor and outdoor worlds, they are in an excruciating state that can lead to hallucinations, sizes, relationship or persecution.
Voting is particularly common - voices that comment, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not rare.
The affected person can no longer separate important from insignificant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks for a flood of ideas and imaginations that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject to focus, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Senior Doctor of the Clinic for General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of the event, everything has a meaning to it.
At the same time he gets into a passive role, he, like in his dream, is overwhelmed by the events and cannot make them active.
Schizophrene therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality comparison is usually not possible for them, the guilders are cruel reality, not awakening.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, remains in principle."
The awesome thoughts and hallucinations are found in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers still imagine puzzles.
Exceptional states can cause each person to lose reality short-term, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic presumption of schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only factors determining.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage in the affected population.
We suspect that neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example, by a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains a mystery how the neuronal system is disrupted, which initially does not manifest itself at all for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis if the disposition exists.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis, as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The crazy thing is, psychologists suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get what, says the Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kast.
Whether they are perceived as pleasant or uncomfortable is often just a matter of point of view.
Box has been collecting reports of hallucinations and frauds for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Irreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are one of the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of amazing many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as Borderline or Depression, these often include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or skull brain traumaata.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, so box, are composed of memory contents that are normally held back.
They arise when brain areas where sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or not inhibited; if our brain runs hot or if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But it is also the gravitational pull, the stress, the cremation of love or other mental exceptions.
In recent studies, up to one third of respondents reported having experienced hallucination at least once in life.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visits the gymnasium there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there weren't any pictures and voices.
During the break it may occur that a slutty boy with long, dark hair speaks.
When it answers him, the fellow students look at it as a surprise - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spoiled day dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? sometimes she asks herself.
But she knows that this boy and the other guilders are not real and disappear again.
At night the apparitions are mostly frightening
Often the guilders are also a burden.
If she is sitting in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material because the teacher presents in her eyes and ears just a new fellow student, while explaining mathematical equations for all other hearing and visible at the table.
At night, the apparitions are mostly frightening.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which comes far too rarely and much too late, she can often not distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming whether the pictures she sees arise the frets or the girl with the bleeding cuts of arms and legs, before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell her they think they're crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is today 20 years old.
She passed her Abitur last year and lived with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she has contacted the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Wahn is also a work of despair
If someone is socially isolated or is suffering from gravitation, he has with great probability after a while hallucinations, says Kast.
I guess the brain is underworked then and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she was 13 years old when she learned that the man she called Dad since she could think was not her physical father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult for those affected such as Sarah K. to distinguish false images and reality. "Every experience," says Box, "is taking place in the brain, reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images that cause the brain to develop, so they seem so real."
Also nocturnal dream images value box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychologically healthy people are able to recognize their false images.
Box therefore advises his patients to value hallucinations as special ability.
Border between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our highly conscious world, imaginary experience is usually pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Psychiatry Hospital and psychotherapy at Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, painful disease, but it also has positive, creative-wah is also a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid experience form, a special form of dream-like change of consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams, which the experienced one considers real and which he cannot distinguish from the guard state in retrospect.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening reality with his own, imaginary world that is uncoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border between dream and hallucination.
Since dealing with a situation is not possible in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is reflected in the imagination.
An intensive form of meaning and meaning in an unbearable situation, which enables us to develop ourselves, does not go into a nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a saving action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness goes on journeys after a heart valve operation with subsequent heart transplant, while his body is condemned to motionlessness at the intensive center.
Clausen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train store, a robot watches his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles who produce drugs from blood.
If a Greek is dragged on the motorcycle in its home country, surfes with its hospital bed in the Finnschnee of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely up in the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner travels are fundamentally different for Clauses from any dream.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
In contrast to that, the memories of mental travel are clearly clear to me even after years and in side details.
More clearly and intensively even than truly experienced.
The intensity of this experience is spreading the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says Psychiatist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug noise show how fragile our inner images of external reality are.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist's box, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can be quite enriching.

Burda
Children should take over the publisher with 27 years
The new publishing director Kallen is an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to hand his company into the hands of his two children in the long term, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding company is expected to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told the SPIEGEL.
We have carefully regulated the details.
The question whether they are also active in the company arises only after that.
Also the question whether they are able to do this.
You can't introduce 7500 employees to your children if they're not sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the Executive Board as of January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda since 1999.
At first, he was responsible for technology.
Later, in the field of Treasury, the responsibility for corporate assets and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhofer also came the responsibility for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the forefront of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of callers also serves to bridge "10, 15 years," Burda says.
The holding company should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
Looking at the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family businesses are not sure before the fall: "This always involved families who were infected by a desire for capital that was completely speculated and thought they could rise up to the very big player.
My strategy was never.
He had "no world power dreams," according to Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play in the world league with 'time', these stores have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least it is what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a store with an area of more than 1000 m2 in Callao (Madrid), where everything is just about body care.
In the wellness area, which is on the eighth floor, one can find, among other things, respected companies such as Hedonai, who provide dehairing with lasers; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxing and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitan with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department, which is characterized by its tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while at the same time having a fantastic view of the capital, or for two hours renting the relaxation area to put your own "beauty party" on your legs with eight girlfriends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total surface area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating areas.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of customer training units and thus offer them a completely personal training.
One starts a training unit with entering a personal password on a touchscreen that is opposite the devices.
Afterwards, you will display various videos on how to correctly perform your training units.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including heating up and stretching) are completely sufficient to train the body muscles.
And then, after you have trained your body, you still want to go by the hairdresser parlor, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments are offered in a personalized way to regain hair, shine and health for your hair.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 22.00 p.m. in the evening 365 days a year.
The Most Different Decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and therefore it is another good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their party clothes into our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that needs to be considered.
Here are a few proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decolleté. Of this one can only be guessed.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa created the "LIVE Bureau" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the Roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidising, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to combine opinions and actions of the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to drive forward the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and, in particular, to their performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The government president, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesied of the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of peace".
In presenting the economic report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the measures that the government launched to support the automotive sector during the government year.
"Unlike the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, today we have a panorama of neglect and the closing of some of our main production plants," the President of the Government stated.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of automotive manufacturers to also produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a quiet horizon for the richness of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided 800 million euros for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than 3 billion euros.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to boost demand, in reference to the 2000E Plan, which are applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and automotive manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows gas emissions to be reduced by 6 % on average in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in approvals that increased by "40 percent" in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmental sport
Mazda wants to prove that sport is quite compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and drive system of the engine on the Mazda3 model, baptised on the i-stop, a device that is currently only available for the 150 hp 2.0 petrol engine.
This second generation of Mazda's 3 stands out because of its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its street behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats you can find that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good hold.
Furthermore, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
In the further consideration of the unit consisting of the instrument panel and the dashboard, it can be found that Mazda, with a variety of buttons and switches, is located in the spectacular colours red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style is partly reminiscent of the style of Honda Civic.
Therefore, it can be said that both Mazda 3, and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the soberness of the German automobiles, especially from Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to exceed.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can easily drive by car.
All of this comes with a spacious and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and drive system is up to now only available for the 2-liter petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed circuit.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out through its fineness, its quiet noises, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in the gear circuit and its low consumption, even though at Mazda especially the diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special because it has a much larger number of elements from the series equipment.
From the serial equipment, the RVM assists mainly to remove the dead angle, as well as the controls for the traction and stability, speed control, light-sensitive internal mirror, on-board computer with a wide screen, sensors for parking, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth, and the chromed 17-inch flags.
In addition, this version also includes, as if not yet enough equipment, the Premium package, which includes the following for extra 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable Bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly important in terms of the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not have many kilometers to go back a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is that it is a little high price, which lies between EUR 21.70 for the Luxury model and EUR 23.270 for the model that is being tested.
In return to this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us every day on the new highest driving pass.
A premiere with lots of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red tepppich of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look just as elegant as sexy, shined more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "pe", as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is too limited, a device with which you can read only his emails without a way to see certain attachments or to surf through the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
It is rather unlikely to see it on the street, but the idea in itself is nevertheless of particular interest to young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half the price of flatrate on an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success of this, it has launched two new devices: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a life-long free data service, quite unlike the peek, where you have to pay a six-time higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those traveling around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to refrain from all the data to read its emails, when you have passed the country border or if you are desperate for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but I experience that you already need a doctoral degree in physics and a good glasses to read all the small prints.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs for Europe as a whole was almost always ignored.
Outside of one's own country, one is always afraid to read his emails and that's right.
The fact that a small device such as FonPeek (where it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have a Wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariff, means that the telephone providers need to think slowly but safely and start to consider various ways in which they can use their data network.
For this, Kindle is another good example; in his prizes, downloading books and other requests is included on the Internet.
Without pavement and without hooks.
This is an Internet-enabled device and one pays for it only one time, namely when buying, and not month for month.
And that's exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a purchase opportunity with lifelong Internet access as the Peek already offers in the USA.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for consumers.
It would be interesting to be able to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is without a doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
At the time of Barack Obama's arrival as president of the USA, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and has again chosen the same color to accompany him at his second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn very similar models in both occasions: besides that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow - the clothing consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and to this she wore slightly embroidered or a necklace.
Even so, at the first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the launch she wore a lace dress and in Oslo a patterned velvet.
Also the accessories were different: the first time green shoes with half-high paragraphs and the second time a lovely model but gold colors.
Also the hairstyle was different every time: the hair was put up as a hair wreath on this occasion, in the previous she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems in their work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study conducted by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women on the Fertility and Careers of Women in Spain.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of women working in the labour market see their career opportunities limited due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not, and if so, what kind of occupation they practice.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the house, work only half-day or have no fixed employment contract become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women move with a firm employment, especially in the public sector, the establishment of a family and motherhood, and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed employment receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after they get together, a figure that increases to 4.1 years for women with permanent employment, who have needed longer to achieve this and who have brought together and the first child realized only much later.
Moreover, the type of work also has a major influence on maternity, although less than the calendar regarding willingness to accept," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account at the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, age at the time of marriage and the first child is higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they have only primary schooling or higher education, averaged 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
Furthermore, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women with their main conclusion marry before their first appointment and get their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree make it very different and seek a permanent position and then get married and then get their first child, Delgado says.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name to its all-embracing list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From the coming year on, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also say the well-known advertising statement "Because you are worth it".
The main actor from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will thus become another famous label, as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Before them were the last to join this exclusive club, the actress Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
In the case of men, the cosmetic company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Gray ́s Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (playing colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion they were all published.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was elected the best model this year.
Manuel Vicent's poker game
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Asses" (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) to the three X-rays of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear - inspiring genre (cursing biography, life and work), but looks for an admirableness to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent does not save from terror or enlightenment.
If this book is a delicious reading, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When reading his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual, just as I have always felt it, without having found words: The joy in contrast to the ill-healed fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any god".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with an overwhelming poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blades that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was moved by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, and those in whose flesh, because of the adultery, the emotions united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that was in coming to heaven on the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odyssey" was released in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8000 summits in the world's literature, you have to climb up on the north wall, on the wall where the best climbers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny chew.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a manor of the county and again another time he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were inspired by a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the mad cry, which was shouted from that personality from Munich, so that his echo would be held in his literary way until the night of the 20th century, and this he made on a journey, on which he fled from himself, and with a speech full of violence in front of the worms, he called upon the afterworld.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day they knelt and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do all things in your power, that I may stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer are engraved: 's sleep after the effort,/ after the thunderstorm of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after a full life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she always had her depression.
The husband took it with total normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying her out between the Azaleas or singing the birds in Greek.
No other case is known, where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotic, whose literary talent was even more grosser than their amazement."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do otherwise than try to inflame Joyce in Baroja?
What did Bent intend to do if he did not lead Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he might put himself on this pod?"
Fee Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 came from next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixedling that we brought out of the pet home and weighs just six kilos, and then they missed him two steps out of the sky and hurt him with it.
Our disarmament cannot be put into words, as it is not understandable to us, since the fun of a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was, of course, carried out on the leash.
In addition, there is the suffocation attack that a woman who walked comfortably got when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he may also do the same with a woman, a child, an older man, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet district at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has been running all day.
Of course, we have reported in a nearby police department, but we have great doubts as to whether this will happen at all and in order to prevent any prejudice from beginning, we would only like to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our disarming over the events has prompted us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what must happen in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and the people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
In cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), the tire manufacturer Michelin launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially for younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "contains more than just the design and manufacture of products that become more and more secure every day" and confirmed that they also contribute to achieving a step closer to this goal every day with other actions of educational and informative character.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle running under the slogan 'To be or not to be' will distribute posters to more than 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that transport safety is "a permanent concern" of the company, and precisely because it is always committed as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles to one of its main objectives being the development of more and more secure products.
The sale of small trucks increases again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally starts to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles approved in Spain in November mean an increase of 12.6% in relation to 2008, and, much more importantly, they are the first increase even after 22 consecutive months with steady decline, according to the figures presented by the manufacturer's association Anfac and the car dealer organisation Ganvam.
However, these good figures are currently only to be taken with great caution, since the reference data used for comparison was November 2008 which was a particularly bad year of sale with a 60% decline in the previous year.
However, it should be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in last month, the total registrations of these 11 months are still 40 % below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all vehicles that make up the small transporter market: emissions from passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small vans and lighter small trucks/cars.
Furthermore, there are still the same thunderstorm clouds in the sky, which are most affected by demand, because even though some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, the bulk of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises that in almost 100 % of all cases make purchases with third-party financing.
For example, these restrictions, which are the result of credit institutions' turned money, need to include further factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the bad economic situation.
With this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support for buying a vehicle of Plan 2000E has not helped much.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, but also self-employed and small companies have a right to buy a small transporter of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 output which cannot exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had reminded us that it was absolutely necessary on the part of the state to pay special attention to these small loads as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (load cars and buses).
The car dealer association prophesy for 2010 is similar to that of the previous year, for which it expects a sales failure (in passenger cars and on-site cars) of 19 %.
Support for brake maneuvers in critical situations is now mandatory
As already with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as it is currently happening with the stability control ESP, emergency braking systems have to become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already required for all newly approved passenger cars and light small transporters, for the rest of the vehicles a karenz period was set by the end of February 2011.
The measures adopted by the European Union aim to improve the protection of passengers, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many accidents caused by their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to carry out more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake maneuver which the system detects on the brake pedal based on the brake strength performed by the driver.
However, this system does not carry out this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to step onto the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not stopped with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system and thus reduces the braking time and thus also the brake distance which a car returns during the braking process.
According to a study by the EU, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving passengers could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistant.
There would even be fewer accidents - one calculates that every fourth accident could be prevented with personal damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects (via radar or camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time it already exerts a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is inevitable, the brake assistant shall exercise the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel until January
While the employees of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were already informed by Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the side concerned has already given its approval to each single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM assures that it will take a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on American car manufacturers to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with some new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, which has back cover from the Russian group Converg, is gaining ever more support.
If none of these buyers were to reach an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used Boxster S as a basis and actually managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, with which he now weighs only 1.275 kilos.
In order to create such a thing, they were the first to avoid the automatic folding roof that was replaced by a tental roof with a manual drive, so that only 21 kilos were saved; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model such as those of the GT3 "disappear" 15 more; by removing the air conditioning still 13 more; moreover, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 litres, thus saving another 7 kilos; by installing sporty Bacquet seats again 12 and with the lightweight 19-inch rims saved 5 more.
Then, due to the failure of the CDR-30 audio system, another six kilos had been reached and the missing kilo was achieved by the exchange of door handles by the grips of fabric.
Although it is also available with the double coupling transmission PDK, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6-speed manual gearboxes, mainly on the smaller country streets of California, on mountain routes that were really very short.
In his driving behavior, he can only be blamed.
However, the reduction in weight has by no means resulted in it being no longer so safe on the road.
It is more the opposite: for a long time, we have not already tested such a small and lightweight model, which gives one a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low pace in the required time, until we give him the orders to shave, brake, recover, and then get everything out of his engine again ...
He's doing everything he says. The car is doing everything we can to show him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as well as precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 Boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and one can increase it with the 'sport' option as well as by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time at Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginably brutal, whether from standing or re-accelerated.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country streets on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the impact holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole track; and this, although we found ice in the morning gray and roll split on some of these curves in the morning.
In summary, one can say that it is an ultralight car, a car with which one has an indescribable driving pass, as otherwise it is rather rare and inside it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster S.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetic line Coco Cocoon and an occasion stencil at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck rigidity as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Basque Union gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electro, despite the many prominent players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, and thus comes to the first place within his group after Mirza Teletovic's big appearance, which was the best of his team with eight triples (29 in the review).
The Vitoria team could replace the significant losses of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mikov by a large dose of use and teamwork, even if they had to wait for their victory until the bitter end.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the blue reds, who from the beginning sat at the top of the scoreboard.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, it was already possible to imagine that they had come to the field with well-heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava decided to play an indoor game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with pipes and applause, which is his home to expand its advantage further until the break (34-43).
Teletovic had already begun to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" evaluation of Splitter already had to believe that this would not be the best evening of Brazilians.
Nevertheless, despite the obvious advantage of the break, the game was not yet decided, and the Maccabees once again wanted to remind the Vitorians that everyone did not win on their playing field, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "hand of Elías" they came back to play.
Eidson and Pnini played a crucial role in the "Yellows" turning the row (50-49).
Even More Disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured, but everything else than dead, had to prepare a few tracks with safety to get air again and one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas provided that on the scoreboard again calming distance from (54-67) that the host could adorn with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alavesen were bloßen in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they deserved honestly in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson did not resign the best of their team and tried to give their team three points again from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was placed from the square because of fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, they defended themselves well and although the Israelis were still picking up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Infringements prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost out loud in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in group B of Euroliga on him, and that in a game marked by the outfalls of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the inner game, which facilitated the Greek victory.
The team from Malaga had no fear of the atmosphere in the hall of peace and friendship or in front of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their presented game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to begin to dream. An aggressive defense and three successive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts dazzled with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, even though the local team with an inner game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show the scoreboard in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favor, the minute in which, due to an action, it would almost have come to the beating between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team started to get warm at last and its superiority on both sides of the game, while leaving the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-produced errors of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces of Unicaja behind.
Among their players in the interior and Lithuanian predecessor Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A hunt was impossible
The third match area was characterized by many attacks against the Olympic team, which, despite its 19 losses, was superior and even managed to offset the difference between the game in Malaga at 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn brought the tour within the group into a swing.
Unicaja tried to dispel the many failures and the withdrawal of the Scottishman Robert Archibald who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute thanks to the lead and the triples of Cook and the use of Lewis again came a bit of hope to 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, as the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimetres within the basket area, was unable to brake.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute to raise the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to beat himself and took the lead in Olympiacos.
How much should you earn on Facebook due to your profile?
Thanks to the new Trovit application, the search engine with most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, Facebook users can now learn their salary that they should earn due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates users' salaries based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users are provided with a form in Facebook to enter their profession, professional experience, age and city where they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish worker felt "badly paid" on average, explains the person responsible for the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through his search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31.059, as opposed to the 24,000 euros that a Spaniard deserves.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of a waiter with an annual rate of 11.592 euros net; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in her message in Tegucigalpa.
The President of the Office shall leave diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 at the latest if his mandate expires officially.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate to the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduran, confirmed to TV Globo that "mel" knows that he must have left before that date the message he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27 because his mandate is due to expire on that day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The sender also quoted the ex-President who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the appointed date: "My position is to go as soon as possible logically with the back cover of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, in the refusal of Zelayas to recognize the status of an asyl-seeking politician who wanted to impose the "de facto" government under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the most seductive days since last spring, when the inflation of assets was the dominant mood in the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is not surprising in any case, as it is their natural state, in an environment in which the brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to compensate the debt with the direct purchase of assets and, indirectly, to allow liquidity to be freely used in interest rates that move around zero so that the banks buy assets to calculate.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are as good as finished and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, start to scatter some sand into the gear, as the BCE Näc already proposed with its annual increase, taking place next week.
This is why investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are just going to witness a reverse in reducing risk premiums.
Stock exchanges and differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to take private risks and government debt is rising again.
One is now relying on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences in the eurozone countries in relation to Germany.
So far, Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision on the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not harm the defenders of the moral risk that had once again tried to raise awareness among the world economic policy leaders of what they had caused, as they had slowed down the devastating effects of limiting loans to job losses, when they were supposed to have called for a new day of thank-you.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emirs in order to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also foreseen earlier.
A government that conceals the sovereign debt, elections and a new government that takes the same line.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that at the beginning of the year, Ecofin rescues Hungary from non-fulfilment of its foreign payments and thus allows a euro-member country to cease fulfilling its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to take its citizens into the duty to maintain the stability of state funds when it comes to the need for ordinary measures.
Yes, as expected, we are faced with an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some spreads on too high amounts, would now be within the expectation.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same speed as the European business bonuses.
However, if European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish continued to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the preferred indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and to correct their 2011 scenario, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long service life despite warning.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment it is called for "presumptuous driving".
Linked branches
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first one to appear yesterday before the subcommittee of Parliament, where the strategy on Spain's energy supply is being debated over the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few points about what he had presented to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and 60 billion more from that date until 2030, subject to the requirement that current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investments needed would not amount to 60 billion, but to up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that one should no longer invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
As of 2020, the question will change and performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with facilities to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energy sources.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the requirement of other "duty energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy, which was just adopted by the government, is in line with what his company requested, in no case wanted to say something against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, one sets clearly in this direction, despite some "individual" measures, as she referred to the chairman of Iberdrola.
As it may be, Galán says that we should take decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework will need to be created to attack them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" from Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, Swiss Port, is the preferred partner of the Irish flu company Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports on which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement on which figures have not yet been published is set at five years' notice.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The alliance plans to invest from 20 million to 2012, of which 50 % will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochdief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel costing 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German high depth are its competitors.
A tunnel 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The city administration wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After managing public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) had decided to advance the project according to a business plan established by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three consortia competing in the last phase, mainly consisting of European construction companies.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best civil engineering specialists.
With Acciona's team, the Northern Direct Consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, is the Australian Transfield, responsible for infrastructure and the Bouygues group of French construction companies.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrowest election, is called LBRJV, made up of the capital of the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochdief, which in turn belongs to the ACP), the also native Baulderstone (in possession of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specialises in public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises enormous construction work and privatisations, but has a barrier to overcome, since only by buying a local construction company has access to it.
A strategy followed by the said companies Hochdief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which must only be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACP has gained access to this market only through its participation of 30 % in high depth, owner of the said Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona is most important in this geographical area for the sector, where it is already known as energy suppliers and in the desalination industry because of its activity.
Among other assets it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies assigned to build and manage Adelaide's desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll line, supported by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (north to hand) has the purpose of connecting the western motorway in Toowong with the bypass in Kelvin Grove (see map) at a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels. This is the largest measure to reduce traffic on the Brisbane Straits.
The map issued by the City Administration foresees the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll track is already scheduled to open for transport in the last few months of 2014, it is expected that construction works will continue by 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilating system.
The Queensland government is participating in financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
Brisbane is already a big business for high depths.
Australia is awarding considerable contracts with the government of 154 million, at high depth, which was signed yesterday.
The ACP sub-company will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cables by means of its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will provide 400,000 people with fast Internet access and the German company will work for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower construction project with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction works have not yet begun and high depth has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools at 25 years.
Initial investments amount to 75 million euros.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has granted itself via its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 km long for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it received the surcharge for construction work to extend the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) to over 130 million.
In this way Alpine is strengthening its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of construction work is planned for early 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services to the Sra agency for the next two years. Rushmore has committed a sum of approximately three million euros annually, the railway company announced.
This Treaty also allows for two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies presenting sch to this competition, of which 4 came to the final round, among them TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and manufacture of the campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom because of the brakes of the competition.
France Télécom has imposed a penalty of more than EUR 63 million on the French competition regulator for anticompetitive behaviour in the Caribbean.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition with fixed network and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and consumer loyalty programmes on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned companies have collected more than 560 million euros of penalties since 1994 due to the handicap of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, as the authority that is waiting for competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and therefore has become reprehensible.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading site on the Internet for the purpose of increasing revenue from business that does not come from the telephone connection.
In principle, this advertising website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
One must wait until 2010 until this site will be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has brought in Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
The Champions League has developed since its creation in 1992 into a source of revenue for the football clubs.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken in 476,4 million since then, bringing them the third and fifth seats of the football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The Champions League of the UEFA not only brings fame with it. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the big clubs.
According to the UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since its founding in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The great club is located in the third place of Europe, which earned the most money through its participation and which, next to AC Milan, is the only one who won the trophy three times.
The final winner of the former European Cup 1992 is the fifth place in the world.
The list is based on Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams who, moreover, took the most money by participating in the previous Champions League.
And that, even though they lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place the countries that were able to make money through the Champions, although it has more titles than everyone else (five, unlike four bee Italy, three at England and two at Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure used by the UEFA.
In this financial year, the organization whose chairman Michel Platini has inne expects revenue of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
From this money, the UEFA 413.1 million provides for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that took part in the qualification course (including the Atlético de Madrid) got 2.1 million.
In addition, those who fought for participation got 3.8 million because of their blue presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each match they fought.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a dissenting (400,000 per team). The clubs that came to the eight-el finals each receive three million; the four that came into the quarter finals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the Second, which receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and no more than 31.2 million fixed revenues.
Barça won the European Supercup in August 2.5 million again.
However, there are still variable payments for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
The master of the last year receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part is distributed according to the number of games they play at this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group last night had detailed information on the purchase offer of shares, with which it intends to acquire a ceiling of between 25 and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage which does not force them to make a public tender (opa) on account of the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which are paid for ten years and with an interest rate of 1 % annually due to this shift.
The Sos shares closed yesterday at EUR 1.85, so Nueva Rumasa assesses the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real evaluation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jérez Group shall give shareholders a 15-day period to inform them of their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
In conclusion, the deposit would amount to 611,7 million, while the value of Sos is 254,27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to reorganise its management.
When trying to stay on the verge of potential offers and the courts of his ex-Managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit.
A decision with which she becomes the first woman who has a high position in the food business.
It is a newly created post directly under the chairman of the group.
This is all but free of polemics, because the company is involved in a judicial battle because of the suspicion of redirecting of more than 230 million sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that in the course of the coming months, Sos will shift further capital.
With regard to Salazar’s credit, ex-advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CM and Unicaja representatives) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their determination.
CNMV approves Paternina’s public invitation to tender submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public invitation to tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer last October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been proved that the conditions adhere to the law and thus the content of the explained leaflet, according to the changes made last December, can be considered "a sufficient one".
CNMV has also announced that this offer aims at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7,65 euros per share, which is, in turn, 8.95 % of company capital, which consists of 6,142,786 euros in shares admitted to Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
It has also been announced that 5.592,778 million shares have been established, which cannot be transferred in any way until the completion of the tender and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws of law.
New vehicle assessment programmes
These days of storms and accidents not only deserve the car workshops
Every day thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged into the workshops, where a reviewer has to assess the damage caused and the costs for repair.
No accident is equal and the calculation of costs for parts and hours of work can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of the auditors use these types of systems.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from manufacturers to process them afterwards and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Solera group, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The two other companies that compete with the tool market for assessment and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that manufacturers provide is all but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is getting bigger, up to the point that more versions, variants and motorizations have been on the market in the last five years than in the whole of fifteen years before.
Once a new car comes to the market, the work starts for the companies.
It is a laborious task, because every one of the several thousand parts of the vehicle has to be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphics image, on which you can "click" various parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, work can be completed in a week if the procedure progresses quickly.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. At present, Audax has 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain with complete information.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle park running on the roads, it is more than 99%.
In order to carry out the documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics professionals) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the preparation of these databases.
Each month they collect 2.5 million data and their customers get updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use of repairs and repairs, but there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for calculating the value of a car's auction or residual value depending on the country.
The only company that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
With the transparency of the products offered by Audax, you can easily gain an overview of the kind of support it gives to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution to assess accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
If the cost of the parts is incurred, it shall include the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
The most expensive it will be for customers who rarely use it 10 times a month, i.e. 5,75 euros per month.
On the other hand, any insurance company that makes thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly belt on its own using the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle disks, and AudaSubastas is an open-ended service on the Internet for vehicles that have been declared to be total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or in order to obtain information on deviations by brand and model.
For example, it is possible to examine how many models of a particular car brand had to be involved in a serious accident due to pans in the workshop or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.

Sales of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline Group bought a flat foam on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value-enhancing, with the opportunity to access a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service applies exclusively to industry professionals such as insurance companies, auditors, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers who have to register before their activities.

According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis counter has been registered may no longer be used on the roads, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
However, historic cars may be re-approved even if they have been registered after difficult administrative procedures.
Cost estimate of workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audax company ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with Internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the chassis number, a graphics of the respective model appears and then the replacement part required is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, surcharges or discounts and thereafter he can print the estimate and pass it on to his customers.
AudaTaller is not a tool to assess like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the work schedule aimed at the workshop does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can pay without further delay.
At the moment, the company Audatex is working on offering these images in three-dimensional formats.
This is an innovation that automechanics have been waiting for a long time since, for example, you can select a door with it and then completely turn the picture around to look at the inside.
