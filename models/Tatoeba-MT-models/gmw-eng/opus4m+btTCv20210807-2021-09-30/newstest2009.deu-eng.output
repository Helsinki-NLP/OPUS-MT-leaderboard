The Prague Stock Exchange collapses against business closure into the Minus.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal day-to-day business.
At the beginning of Tuesday’s business, the Prague Stock Exchange linked to Monday’s collapse as it sank by another six percentage points.
This time, the reason for the collapse was at Wall Street.
Even in the Czech Republic, the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a Stabilization Plan for the financial sector there, is shown.
Fall of shares in Asia
A dramatic case on Tuesday experienced the shares in the Asian stock exchange, although the indexes were able to compensate for some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Index of Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points over the course of the business day, but was later able to match some of the losses, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, the markets were closed in Shanghai.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock exchange fell by 3.6 percent, according to the index there.
“The timing for the U.S. rescue action is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide,” said the Chief of Monetary Authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong determines, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, i.e., independent of the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong move at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft for support of the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the outbreak.
A Bloodbath of American Shares
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system for spending up to $700 billion (almost 12 trillion Kč).
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush’s view that the plan would regulate the basic causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilize the entire economy.
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the most important stock indexes recorded the biggest break in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, a similar break he had recently recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was hardly any indication that the draft would not come through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes funding: U.S. government can pump $700 billion into banks
The U.S. Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial aid for the American financial system.
In addition, it is expected to be approved at the beginning of next week.
In talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid for the U.S. financial system, US$700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns) reached a breakthrough.
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
Congressmen must negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final opinion of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the U.S. Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
In the Senate, it is likely that different information could be agreed on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
Economists should report that the plan will be adopted, the first important psychological factor for an experience of the financial markets.
After that, however, it comes to a 'enjoyment' due to the complicated mechanisms as to how to help markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan needs to be effective
“We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package to stabilize the market should look like, said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg.
According to your words, Sunday could be a final vote.
Representatives of the legislature met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for a purchase of unsales mortgage assets from the financial companies, which overthrow financial firms in heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We stand at the edge of a final agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
One has to continue the health plan, but I think we are on the target, as Paulson said.
A Signal for Asia Business
The global financial crisis is also very low in the stock markets, which fall heavily.
According to the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators were trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
In this way, it is a matter of calming the investors in the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision by Congress might affect the businesses on Monday.
However, it is not yet clear when both chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, nor does there exist any clear evidence as to whether the negotiations in the last minute could still fail to deal with a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
The law, however, will experience some changes.
The total amount for the aid for the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is expected to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
The Congress, however, can block the dispensing of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, namely at another $100 billion and later at the final $350 billion.
Bush values progress in negotiations positively
While the President has a right to veto in this decision, Congress can agree on his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has remained to exist, which is based on obtaining funds for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to pay back their mortgages.
“We worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, the Senate on Monday, according to Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The progress was also made by President Bush.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto explained that Bush is satisfied with the progress of Saturday and \"estimating both efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy\"
Limiting golden parachutes
The chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the monetary programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the completion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the programme and set up a committee to oversee the fund.
He is to lead the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on it and achieved great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also accounts for a help for homeowners who have problems with the refund of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance’s chief economist David Marek, but the implementation will be very difficult.
“This is because you don’t know by which mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are purchased.
This will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves,” Marek said to the iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week, Mareks' view is not decisive.
“It is more important that Congressmen agree to support the plan and to adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on the fact that it comes to a decision is the most important thing at this moment, Marek stressed.
Duell on knife cutting: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We will advise you on your choice
While almost every phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still phone.
It seems, of course, that it is better to buy just one phone.
Despite all of this, there are plenty of reasons why you should set up an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of future owners.
It’s hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
Once such musical novels do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one such one.
This is also how it is expressed with music on trips, i.e. with compressed music, simplified - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For the one, it may not be acceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, but also a Pink-Floyd fan is likely to be a heavy headphone for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is broadly packed.
The service life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do doesn’t even create meaningful ways.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, calling and simsing, it can replay music and videos, both record, it has a better, once worse photo device and may also be able to navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little wonder, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the more often you will have to download it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy fresheners.
Only a few phones can play music for more than ten and twelve hours, usually it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are far more powerful.
Therefore, you should expect to be able to play music for more than a few hours in the cheap phones.
If you are still calling from time to time, you may prefer to buy a charger for the office - that is also true for more expensive devices.
For MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the less good keep for at least 9 hours uninterrupted operation once charged.
Another problem is if you want to play music on your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB lock, and not every mobile phone without a special software can be directly connected to a PC.
Of course, music can be played directly on a storage medium, but few card reading devices will be done without reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
For players, no special software is required until exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves set up a music library, arranged by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the assessment by users.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can be more
When selecting a specific device, you should, in particular, ask about the life span of the battery, storage capacity, quality and type of sound and of course also the operating comfort.
If for you music is especially culpable and you hear it every day only briefly, for example, on the tram, then there is a phone that plays MP3 files.
What almost every cell phone can do.
You also don’t have to control what music formats a cell phone or player can process.
MP3 creates all, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most widely used, and most devices can also play music in the WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that uses Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already acquire a song or album.
This service can already be a decisive argument for why you should set up a music phone.
Unfortunately, the provider’s offer is bad and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is expected that this type of selling of music (be it via GSM, Internet or wireless internet) will become the music industry in the future.
The mobile phone carries most of it.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket bag while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it is up to you whether you also always wear a headphone or at least a wireless talk device.
If not, you can access the integrated speaker, which has almost any cell phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The biggest advantage of the music phones will be in price for many.
The cheapest costs are usually less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns, you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest disability will be for most, that no normal headphones are there.
The best and technically mature phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player is, in turn, in the light of operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operating with the previous normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
It does not threaten collision in the form of an erroneously hired mobile internet and a subsequent hearing bill for data transmissions.
Which device should you use now
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, there are two thousand crowns.
But respect.
In the basic models, usually only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive can also read 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy another low-cost MP3 player, then access Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Engeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to place more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be among the more demanding listeners, prefer specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent operating buttons for MP3, and the operating comfort thus comes to that of a single MP3 player.
Most importantly, Sony Ericsson is here, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the single-sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) give you MP3 players of the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider comes to the Czech Republic this year.
Ordinance
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider who forces the classics to lower prices.
Maybe he won't wait for a long time.
The fact that Czech mobile phone providers are working at the most expensive in Europe, we have often reported on Mobile.cz.
On the other hand, this also confirmed the telecommunication authority ČT particularly aware that the price of an SMS is higher than that of the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps taken by the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming fees, it is likely to be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile phone providers, SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
Why are prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a fight ansage.
It may sound paradoxical, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
The mobile providers, on the other hand, like to boast that there is a great deal of competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČT satisfys) Pavel Dvořák, who, in the past, often said that there is no room for any other provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with his own network no longer has particularly many chances (at least he would hardly find frequencies).
However, there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile phone market brought a significant price reduction to which the classic mobile phone providers had to respond.
Before entering such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in the UK, there were similar voices to those in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, you don’t need to look for examples for a long time.
In February, we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobileking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider has been able to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the country’s five largest provider.
Behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group, which has U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
You don’t need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, however, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobileking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good chess move to put on a non-cliché target group.
This provider is specifically addressed to men.
“Each guy chooses Mobileking - the provider they like and can trust,” said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could also be found in the Czech Republic.
The press spokesman of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubted: “The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offer -
In the Czech Republic, mobile phone providers
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile phone provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobileking.
“We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particularly restrictive.
It’s going to be a market entry by Mobileking in other countries of our region, as said in a telephone conversation for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, press spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
In direct terms, she confirmed that the current mobile phone providers in the Czech Republic are not particularly approved of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competitor arises.
Your interest in starting a virtual mobile phone provider has been shown for a long time by the Group GTS Novera, who wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-net, but also mobile-telecoming services.
And the earlier, the better.
We have discussed this possibility repeatedly with all Czech mobile phone providers.
With some of them, we were already able to reach negotiations progress, according to Pavel Kaidl’s press spokesman.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Unofficial information reveals that the first virtual provider may be expected to wait until the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
“At this moment, we don’t assume that there is room for a full virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has great specificities over other markets.
To date, we have not yet addressed a subject with a complex and serious project in this field, as stated in his statement for Mobile.cz Vlastimil Sršeio from Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specificity of the Czech market.
The press spokesperson for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová rarely added in line with O2’s statement: “By far we have not yet found a viable and both advantageous project that could be built on,
And she adds: “In the T-Mobile network, hardly a virtual provider will appear by the end of the year.
At this moment, we must already have a specific offer to think so short-term.
Vodafone focuses on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: “For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the field of sharing costs and infrastructure.
We consider this to be the best from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to seek a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet.
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The operation of mobile phone providers is easy to understand, another provider called more competition, this would reduce prices and thus also lead to a decline in profits.
Why, then, should such a competitor be easier to enter the market?
The fact that providers can draw on a strand when it comes to something also demonstrates the long back and forth of U:fon.
The most likely pressure towards ČT especially went from the company’s T-Mobile when U:fon came to the market.
This also demonstrates the publicly accessible information from the ČT particularly web pages.
Now, however, U:fon is just right as an argument as to why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: “The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has recently also been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile phone provider.
Taking into account the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new actor would put high demands on the market itself and, above all, its services.
However, in view of this approach to mobile phone providers, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTий which, unfortunately, in Czech countries - unlike the UK and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to engage in economic competition.
It only has the office to protect the economic competition.
This, however, involved his very typical attitude to this whole problem.
“The market entry of a virtual mobile phone provider would then be possible after it has come to a conclusion of a contract between a mobile phone provider and a virtual provider about the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, as the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting to the classic providers, as in response to our request Kristián Chalupa from the Department of Foreign Relations of the SINGOHS.
The representatives of the providers would not be surprised by such a formulation.
From an authority representing consumer interests and, among other things, to make sure that no one abuses its position on the market, this is more than concerns.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: “Abroad where virtual providers work quite normally, it is to be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile phone services.”
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not part of the interests of the ŞOHS.
In this case, truly shocking is the almost already touching agreement of the three mobile phone providers, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is on hand.
Just as the absolutely same fuel price at the gas stations is certainly just coincidence and the result of a hard competitive fight.
“In this case, the authority has not discovered any signs that indicate action directed against competition, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the providers have a dominant market position, so he also does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his trade on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile phone market for virtual providers are likely to be lacking in the regulatory authority for telecommunications,” Chalupa added in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many disputes.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, worked out by the ČT especially, and a single market is a single market in terms of telecommunications from the perspective of the economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile phone providers have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - for the market entry of a virtual provider, the approval of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile phone provider has, logically, the monopoly for his network.
This means that it necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not engage in this argument, there should be at least one warning for the énoHS that three mobile phone providers are doing a similar thing.
Complaints of a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) testify that they encounter very similar obstacles during negotiations with all providers.
The removal of responsibility to the ČTé is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ČOHS interferes from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been successful in the recently adopted Novel of the Telecommunication Act to extend the ČTE's competence in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
This is only too well known by the representatives of the échoks, but they are likely to have other interests.
It's all about when no one's looking
Without consideration, it is only once that any pseudo-viral provider that has the same number in the Czech mobile networks remains.
It is companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partly public.
In general, these are companies that operate in multilevel marketing.
Private mobile phone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually go only to select ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company is acting against the operator as a classic company customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile phone providers prohibit similar joint sale.
“If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which can result in an end to cooperation with the appropriate society,” Martina Kemrová answered our question on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not be discussed with the controllers of the mobile phone.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such action.
In fact, from the activity of these companies they do not have to lose profits, at the same time, they are not affected by actual official marketing, unlike the actual virtual providers.
On possible problems, Miroslav Čepický notes: “The law allows such types of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
These must also accept that the SIM card on their phone does not run on its name, so they cannot fully possess the normal customers of mobile phone providers.
Even so, at least this would have to be strange.
In addition, a further question is open to the ŞOHS.
Close the mobile phone providers before such action, why do they lock themselves against a virtual provider?
It is also added that the INGOHS has quite strong powers to detect such activities, and if it does not, it should not be satisfied with the declaration of the providers, they know nothing of it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been emphasized several times in the text, the entry into the market of virtual providers has resulted in a significant price decline in the various services.
In this regard, virtually in all countries where virtual providers were created, the classic providers have tried to avoid their origins virtually more or less.
The arguments used by them were virtually identical - a too small or too saturated market, problems in the quality of the services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies in these moments are currently taking action, which did not seek to preserve the interests of mobile phone providers, but who were trying to keep their customers.
Whether it was due to formal measures or non-formal pressures, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies assign themselves to the whole case as a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot deny the impression that uncertainty in the competences in these cases is more than favorable.
But we don't throw the flint into the grain.
When the background information is voiced and a virtual provider is soon revealed, the mobile phone market may soon be moving again.
If a provider permits the creation of a virtual mobile phone provider, the énoHS will not remain inactive when it comes to refusing (discriminating) other interested parties.
Finally, the Czechs will not be able to call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my home country on the day of Czech citizenship.
The hymn was newly played by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in chore and in an instrumental version.
The song recording took over Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Yeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server, you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech National Song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told the Czech broadcaster that he has chosen singers with young, representative voices that are distinctive and popular for the solo variants.
“From the beginning, I have tried to keep a clear dictation with both and then with the choir so that you can understand the text well so that an agreement arises — the conductor said.
The Czech National Hymn will be celebrating its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m.j first aired in 1834 on the stage of the standing theatre in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first trophies of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the “new” hymn sound?
On Wednesday, Prague transport companies are also on a chip for the first time.
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague’s transport companies as a date on which the first passengers enter a subway, tram or bus to carry an electronic coupon in the bag instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently purchase about one hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day, or an annual coupon ( not valid from 1 January 2009) and can be played on their chip card at the same time, in the information centers and branches of the transport companies at the Muzeum Subway Stations, Miostek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letóany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahra, Kačerov and Luka.
The Coupons have also been available via the Internet on the pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon.
Those who use internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they have to wait regularly for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon over the internet, it is played on the opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
“At these points there is also a switch with trained staff available to the travelers, the interested person advises on the internet purchase and also plays the coupon on the card, according to the speaker of the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on the opencard, which are fitted in some subway vehicles.
What do such automatics look like?
They’re red, reminding of passenger drivers, the passengers may have noticed them already in the Roztyly subway stations, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“There are currently five of them in the city, but until the end of the year it should be eighty,” Opatrný adds.
The coupon controls an automatic instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work from tomorrow is simple.
You only need to enter the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon will play itself.
The electronic coupons will not only be in the capital from tomorrow, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburbs and on the bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, the inhabitants from municipalities of the Central Bohemia region in particular came to the capital.
“In the trains that are part of Prague’s integrated transport, the train’s companion reading devices, which allow them to check the validity of the coupons in time and zone,” explains Philipp Drápal of the organization Ropid, which sets out the timetables for the Prague transport companies.
The suburb buses have card reading devices at the driver’s cash box.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card is placed at a designated location on the side of the box.
So the driver controls the validity of the coupons played.
“If a passenger will check the validity of the coupons played, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information,” Drápal said.
A passenger who does not travel with suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends may again go to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information on the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The U.S. called for a popular decision.
In 1945 the Sudeten Germans sought to join the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the umbrella of the United States of America.
With such a wish, in 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans would have turned to the U.S. Presidents.
This is based, among other things, on a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and which is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumau asked the American president to refuse to allow the return of the \"Sudetengaus - which was taken on the basis of Hitler's Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that American units do not enter as oppressors and enemies of German territory, but as liberators, it is signed in a letter that says, ‘People who are at heart’.
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech National character - suspect that they would expect brutality, carelessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection of the Bohemian forest for today and forever.
“We can’t believe that you, without regard to the view of a quarter million residents of this area, are addressing a foreign state that has oppressed and tried to eliminate minorities and has simply contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies,” the letter said.
The reason why the writers cannot sign is alleged to be the fear of revenge by the Czech oppressors.
If the U.S. President raised doubts about the minds of the Bohemian Germans, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a popular decision in the Böhmerwaldgau about whether the inhabitants would be part of the United States or living under the protection of the United States.
Although the letter’s text may sound somewhat naive in today’s post-war history, it is, in the opinion of some witnesses, a good picture of what was then expected of the Sudeten Germans.
Even though the Bohemian Germans at least had to admit that they were going to negotiate about their expulsion from the Republic, only a few of them had such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Still others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweiss.
He was used in the war as a Budweiser German at the Navy at the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and he was taken to a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him, and he taught them Czech.
“They believed that if they came home, they would come to the Czech people,” Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners of war who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of Beneš decrees.
Don't think - then pay!
An emotional campaign is aimed at motorists
The most expensive action for safety on the streets in Czech history.
This is how the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday, could also be characterized.
The authority of Minister Aleš éebíček promises to deliver drivers from dangerous behavior behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, on radio, in cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to take the driver from too fast driving and alcohol at the tax.
And she also remembers to dress up before the ride.
The campaign mainly aims to talk to young drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The \"bloody\" slogan of the entire campaign also testifies to this:
Don't think - then pay!
The words “do not think” are in large letters on a mark sign.
And in a laughter of blood, the word is “pay.”
This means that one can pay for a moment of insignificance with one’s own life.
The spots will shock viewers until 2010
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see quite normal images with drastic shots of accident victims.
It promises that the accident numbers and the number of traffic deaths in Czech roads will fall.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar bread and peitsche for the drivers
“The motto of sugar bread and peitsche applies to the drivers.
Sugar bread means that when you drive red, for example, it saves time.
The Peitsche is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver needs to be reminded of the risk - according to the transport psychologist at Na Homolce Martin Kořán Hospital.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist says.
Even less effective are in his opinion tables that make drivers aware of a danger.
“If you put up a static table that warns of a danger, it will probably soon be left with the environment, and the drivers will no longer notice it,” Kořán says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of the Provisional Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, spoke out for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the Jordanland, East Jerusalem and the Golan highs, if you can make peace with Palestine and Syria in exchange for that.
This he emphasized in an interview printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot newspaper.
“We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to resign to the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without it,” he added.
He admitted that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
“The one who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem,” Olmert noted in a statement on two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a “special solution for the temple children and sacred and historic places” located in the territory of the old town.
“Those who want to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work, he continued.
Deduction of the Golan Highs
Olmert spoke for a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan highs, which, according to his view, is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the sides of Damascus.
“My proposal is not to make peace with Syria only on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan-Highs,” Olmert said.
“The Syrians know only too well what they need to give up in order to get back the Golan highs.
They will have to abandon their current relationship with Iran; they will have to abandon their relationship with the Hezbollah movement; they will have to abandon the constant support given to the terrorism of the Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus is not allowed to run around.
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus from the company Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewards and Travelers are allowed to walk back and forth during the bus.
“If we wish to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law,” said Charles Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Department of Transport.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-two-year-old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
At this moment, the young woman was at all odds next to the driver, at least safe in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus may also have an accident at the moment or slowly brake in which the Steward broadcasts coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role in whether the bus is equipped with standings after the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided on the bus, the travelers must sit.
Student Agency's long-distance buses do not have standings; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
“We have discussed this with the Ministry, and this has not been the first time the movement of travelers has been agreed upon.
Later, one took this back, and we came to a consensus as to what travelers may go to the toilet during the trip if they have their seat - he told his point of view.
The law does not know Steward
\"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation that prohibits the transporter from providing services.
The road traffic law is only known as a vehicle companion; however, its rights and obligations do not define it - the spokesman for the Ministry clearly adds.
The Director of the Department of Street Vehicles of the Department of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law covers this issue afterwards.
“It’s up to you whether the bus in the product permit also has standing places.
That’s all that, he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standings and the maximum speed is limited, near-distance buses with standings and a higher allowed speed and long-distance buses without standings with the highest allowed speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP driver for traffic safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
“In a fluid way, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Here, too, is not sure when turbulences come, and the stewardess can kick his head.
“But if a bus is sharp, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Same as in the city bus or on a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by internal regulations - he says and also says that this problem is not completely solved from the standpoint of the law.
Jančura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency offers stewards services as the only bus company.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider his profession as risky even after the accident.
“But as soon as I get the impression that the Steward’s profession is risky, I’ll cut it off.
Coffee and newspapers can get travelers on entry.
This would reduce costs, too, he says.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin founded the lack of stewards in his buses, but his society only operates a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
“We don’t have stewards, but we’ve been fighting from the very beginning.
Earlier or later, this ended with some fatal accident - he had not spoken for Týden.cz a year ago.
This was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a line bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region had crashed, who had worked for two years for society.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent off the stand strip without flashing and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to escape through a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front with the truck.
The fact that the two places for the Stewards had been sold, Jančura objected.
“These places can’t be reserved for remote connections, they’re blocked.
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court judgment, but a financial compensation will be expected from the guilty.
A law change?
Not in sight
A more accurate regulation of Steward’s movement on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation on which a thirty-seventh expert team of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
“But this has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the highest speed on the highway, and the use of mobile phones on the ride - according to Dr. Hořín.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider Stewards’ activity to be a major threat to the safety of travelers,” Hanzelka said, controlling the safety of buses is in the competence of the police and the security authorities.
Dusseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words, in the letter of the WestLB Board, it is not missing from the employees of the house.
By combining units of the Düsseldorf Money Institute with the Frankfurt Deka Bank, the central capital market house of the Sparkassen financial group can be created, it says, in the letter announced on Monday.
The WestLB entered a “competence block” with sustainable yield power into such a business.
And at all times, such a connection could be the decisive cause of further alliances in the national banking sector.
This is how it is when a board of directors wants to demonstrate action ability in a difficult time.
Because the hit WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Institute, which the North Rhine-Westphalian State Government recently made clear, the time was running out to find a future solution.
A connection between the Deca Bank and the Sparkassen customers because of their investment funds, and the WestLB, however, has been the talk for some time - also on Frankfurt side.
While Deka bank chief Franz Waas has been informed of half-yearly figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house at Mainzer Landstraße with a land bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deca, who will be carrying half of the state banks and savings associations, has assigned the Board to conduct talks with the WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have been free, so it says in the financial place, just started.
From the Deca Bank, which is one of the most important employers at Frankfurt’s financial square with its 3000 employees, is not the first time it has been said when it comes to consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003 it looked like a moment when the Deca Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba.
There was nothing from this trinity, however.
The plans had almost become public, and the Hessian state government spoke out against the Helaba’s involvement in it.
Even the two other houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate instead went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there has always been thoughts about a connection between the Deca Bank and State Banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, Helaba’s CEO, spoke out against planning games about joining his house.
Regardless, however, it seems to mature that a collapse of the various houses of the public-law sector does not.
After the Bavarian election ended, the BayernLB’s connection with the Baden-Württemberg State Bank could be the first to close.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily a good news.
Should the pressure rise to further mergers, you will gradually go out to the partners for it.
In the south, she was only a junior partner, although she has endured the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, an association with the West LB, the Sparkassen and Giroverband Hesse-Thüringen, which is involved with 85 percent in the Helaba, has pushed forward a belt at the beginning of the year.
Stay the North LB at all.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only the one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models fit each other.
In June, Merl expressed the crucial question of what business model will ensure the future of the state banks, has not been answered by the German Sparkassen and Giroverbon.
In the end, a disintegration of the West LB might also be possible, but it is not desired there on its own.
In the letter of the Board of Directors there, it is also said that a “co-operation solution” will definitely be sought for the house.
How this can bring individual units together with the Deca Bank under a hat will still show up.
The second weekend of the week is known as the 'Italian Weekend'
For Elena, it is the first time for Luca, the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with her as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer façade of the brand Kaiser, stands a massively built barter and proves the about 200 oktoberfest traveler, which deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena only gives Luca a hug, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova railway station, starts four buses this evening at 23:45 p.m., “destinazione Monaco, fasta della birra - arrival expected 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, on a bus travelling exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americas are already singing alongside their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says, that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with pelzimitate feed and a glasses with wide silver hooks, is part of the buses.
For five years they have been driving to the Oktoberfest, three tours alone this year.
At night, on the way back at 22:30 p.m.
Nighting would only mean unnecessary sprees, Marco says.
75 Euros costs the ride, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, married faithful to the Bavarian purity bid, health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And the buses are already rolling into the night, on the Autostrada towards \"Brennero\"
There is no beer, not yet.
Quickly it will be quiet on the bus, the travelers will sleep.
Well, they will still need their powers.
Salaries will be held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where there are several other buses with Italian characteristics on Highway 8 just before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese in the early half of the 7 o'clock schedule, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final address, explains the attack plan.
First, set up the yellow pattern.
On the left is the \"Oktoberfest\" in Fractur, along with the internet address of Marco's travel agency: \"conoscersiviaggiando.it\"
Second, “If the doors to the beer tent go up, it means running,” Marco calls in the morning.
\"Run - running and occupying the places in the rear part of the tent.
\"Not in front of us, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, distribute in the room.\"
The measure, bruising Marco, costs €8.25.
And don't forget to drink money.
“The security officials show that we are well behaved!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone.
Third: \"Today's evening point half eleven found here again - minds?
It's all about showing up.
Along the way, a yellow cap binds as a waymark to the trees, to signs and even to the electoral poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be ready for the withdrawal.
It is the second weekend of the week known as the 'Italian Weekend'.
There are no exact details about numbers; the speech is from 50,000 who make their way across the Alps and enter the beer tents, 10 percent of all visitors are to be visited from Italy this weekend.
The Münchner Police is strengthened by seven South Tyrol police, Italian volunteer helpers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a nation-state statistics in which the Italians in front of Britain (about 60 bets) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical supplies in the first place.
It is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Believers of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, and Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück emphasized it only last week.
How good that the politician used the word “relative” and also influenced that the German banking sector would not be spared from the crisis-stricken developments.
Because it is now in the weekend.
The Münchner real estate funder Hypo Real Estate (HRE) noted in the Dax receives a billion-dollar credit from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulences in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the credit aid amounted to up to €35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate only had to pay off the part it also claimed.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Backgrounds are losses to the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which he has given money, the state financier had refinanced extremely short-term - which is no longer possible due to distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s bar reserve was reduced by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity rate had slightly dropped from 1.6 to 1.45%.
The current profits and net earnings from financial businesses fell to zero over the previous year, the income from tenders to claims and certain securities, and from the dissolution of returns in the credit business by more than 70% to €5 million.
As a result of higher yields from reimbursement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reduction of interest rates according to the order of tender and from the business supply for corporate companies, the earnings rate had still dropped by around 16 percent.
The former state financier had first speculated with commercial real estate loans after its privatization in 1990, which had then been disintegrated into the Aareal Bank.
Because of a lack of funding in the classical state, the Depfa had then strengthened itself in infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects of private investors and the state (Czech Public Partnership, PP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make a write-off that will have a “essential material effect” on the group’s profit and loss bill, it is quite undecided.
The fact is that the dividend was deleted.
By 2007, it had been cut by two-thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been an important state and infrastructure financier since the Depfa acquisition.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refunding on the interbank market, as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the loan of credit among the banks is again largely lost, as the banks were hearing their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funding for a part - around 50 billion euros - of Depfa's credit portfolio.
According to the information provided by the Hypo Real Estate, the group’s need for funding with the credit is to be paid at a distance of time and the company is protected from the influence of the currently largely functional international money markets.
From other sources it can be heard that thanks to the funds the refinance was secured until the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke said, on the other hand, that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets at a distance.
Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Institute (BaFin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group has now been secured.
This is to hope for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and inevitability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not surprising that funding does not have to be fully used.
But the opposite is also not to be eliminated.
On the late Sunday evening of the meeting after the bank was still ahead of the insolence, the least temporary rescue could not calm the mothers.
The stock rate is 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the loan courses are quite good.
While the lower debt is hardly moving, the rates of the downside bonds indicate more clearly.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are affected and understandably the durations beyond 2009.
If hypo-real-estate bonds are to be considered a speculative investment alternative, their value must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant deterioration of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which, with the acquisition of the Depfa, had first brought the crisis into the home.
As long as the interest banks, governments and less charged business banks are still ready to support the system, as long as it is possible to get out of a temporary relief of pensions.
Or, it happens that what is hardly yet to be hoped for is that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports beyond the scope of the sub-governmentalisation, there is currently only a legitimate hope from the risk of security.
This may, above all, prepare longtime believers some sleepless nights with the decision to separate themselves from their engagements.
Short-term investors can also use a final strike to form a loss charge for future pay-off tax payments on course profits later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is to introduce herself to Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls begin to kick: The German is total — kawaii —!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
“The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had Bammel before the school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't run away.
The start of the class at Tachibana does not seem as strictly fixed as we do at home in Lower Saxony.
The students will trade from eight a.m. until about twenty before nine begins a short meeting round with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the class began, I was on the line to introduce myself.
I’m not the guy who likes to talk to people, even before a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform, I wore an old skirt of my guest mother, blue, blue knee drops, and black leather shoes.
So in this lift I put myself before the pult and tried to pronounce everything right: 'Sayonara Where She Sylvana...' - I'm called Sylvana, come from Germany and have birthdays in a week.
At the time, I was very happy that I had started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all interceded, gnashed, and grown and continued to hear the word “Kawaii”.
I already knew that from my mangas.
It is part of the survivalal vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'lowly, sweet'.
Then I quickly got into my place.
The girl next to me had quite a wide border, she found it an honor that the exchange nurse should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the Gong sounded, I was regularly stormed.
All talked about each other and kicked and asked holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, all of their bentos were packed out.
My host mother had made me such a lunch box - that's a bit different from the red German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofu coat.
Most of the time, I don’t have a blunder, what exactly I’m eating here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely novel.
It is clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, maybe until the salty inflated plums, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a self-prepared bento to a boy, who is then especially artful to her, hoping to get to know the boy more about the break talk.
I read it in my manga comics.
I'm wondering if I can watch it here too.
'Why do you think of Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
“Because it’s fascinating to me now.
Finally, I have been reading the favorite mangas for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and culture in them, I also started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
It was clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
I also have a great deal for tradition, sitting and customs.
And this is where we place great value on it.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here yet, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen.
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a sheep flees in danger, does that mean she also feels afraid?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Just how could you check if you felt the same when you behave the same way we do?
In the Internet magazine Edge, contributions to famous scientists have been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of selected answers to the question “What do you think is true without being able to prove it?”
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without anyone or anything else being able to prove this so far where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, at least we can hope because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and cut up questions of feeling or quite general consciousness, we enter into inexhaustible terrain because the hardware does not agree.
When a rat is at risk, it does the same thing as many other animals: it turns dead, escapes, or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't think so.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
For one thing, the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and the execution/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in the rest of the primitives and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to assume that man is even different from the other primitives.
Another dramatic characteristic may lie in man’s linguistic nature: since so much of his experience is connected to language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly affect, so that animal consciousness, as it may also be, is likely to differ greatly from most of our state of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to determine what consciousness might look like in other animals.
If it can be analyzed as something internal and subjective, neither measured nor, because of the special hardware, based on our own experience, then his research presents big problems.
Most of my versions refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that might be more scientifically accessible.
One could examine the awareness processes of animals with no regard to their content, and that is exactly what happens when studies on the short-term memory of Primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick pursued, one focuses more on the neural correspondences of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the state arrival of visualization.
What is the result for the sensations?
I lead them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its own activity conscious brains.
What we call “fear” is, therefore, the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) in the brain proves work memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, the primats and, in particular, the people.
Associated with linguistic nature results in fine grades of feeling because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, says that sensations from more primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of the cortex and the brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much over the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in cross-generational sensations.
I can’t accept it in theory, but I think it’s unverified.
Pankseep argues what appears to rats and people like fear, likely also in both cases: How, though, can you check whether rats and people feel the same when they behave similarly?
Does a sheep fly at risk if it feels afraid?
In my eyes, mere likeness of behavior cannot prove any equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brains, sheep do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove this to man, how would you prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from those of ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress at the neural level will be achieved here if the same is measured in rats and humans.
Just as I don’t explore language and consciousness in rats, nor do I feel, I don’t know if they exist.
One might think this is short-sighted, but I prefer to walk against a wall constantly.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Time of Grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
“The government sees Uefa’s decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the EM together with Poland,” Wasjunik said.
“But this is not amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to do in both countries.
In the schedule for building or rebuilding the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts follow.
Perhaps even the number of EM stages is reduced from eight to six.
“We can no longer waste time.
We need to work at the highest speed now - said Ukrainian association president Grigorij Surkis.
“UEFA will keep us constantly in mind.”
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
It is “the serious risk that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules,” Drzewiecki said to the Polish news agency PAP.
“We have assured Uefa president Michel Platini in a letter that preparation for EM 2012 will not be suffering below.”
Several first-ligists were sentenced to forced decline only in the past season, and ultimately even the league start had to be delayed in the short term.
Inspired by Dennis Quaid
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her associate Dennis Quaid as a spouse.
It's foaming - and it's slamming back.
The late Rosenkrieg of ex-husbands Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now carrying out an unpleasant dispute with each other — in general.
Meg Ryan, in an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week, said for the first time for the reasons for the failure of marriage: “Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful.”
The extent of fraud has only been experienced after divorce.
The occasion for the soul triptease was Ryan's press work for her new film The Women - told the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his dating as an unfaithful husband seemed clear: \"Unfortunately - be it, the 54-year-old of the New York Daily News, said that \"meg for the time being re-creates and retolds the history of our relationship\"
It is also regrettable that the joint 16-year-old son, Jack, is remembered publicly for the pain and transformation that divorce means for every child.
While Ryan has been living alone since divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently fathered by twins.
And so close his instigations with the side lever: “My life goes on anyway.
I am happy that I have a wonderful family that goes best.
Prices of tickets and hotels drop
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, flights were even up to 50% cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, after a rise in prices in the first quarter, determined a significant break in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, the nights of many places have already been legalized.
From January to March, prices in 41 of 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, prices were already 3.6% lower than last year.
The most significant trend in Paris and Rome was where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
As a result, American Express sees the weak dollar rate that has led to a “deteriorating travel desire for American tourists.”
Financial sites such as Frankfurt or London are also affected by the decline in hotel prices as industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rise by 26.3 percent even keep the record in Europe.
Even at flight prices, the trend in the first quarter showed up:
Due to kerosene destruction, travelers in the economy class had to pay 7.1% more than 2007, fuel-intensive long-distance flights were even up to 29.2% more expensive.
From April to June, prices for tickets to the economy class dropped by an average of 12.5% compared with the previous quarter, however, in the business and first class the price changes were much lower.
In Germany prices broke even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter, prices fell by 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights, according to the study, prices have even been halved.
The reason for the collapse of prices is, on the one hand, the neglecting economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the flight travel market breaks down.
On the other hand, the open-skies agreement, which liberalizes flight traffic between the United States and Europe, has increased competitive pressure.
Signs of the tense situation are the cancellation of unprofitable routes on airlines, as well as the high number of airlines who had registered in the first half of 2008 bankruptcy - these were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV hits Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV will be a table guide.
At Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to find a functioning elf.
By Kristoffer Klein, break landing for national players Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher only came into play late and failed with a lever to the Latte.
His message was accurately formulated, she was convincingly talking about the lips.
He simply knew he was right.
\"We need the second gate - Hermann Rieger found himself in the cabin entrance of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most sat back in their places.
Rieger was nearly three decades of HSV’s physiotherapist, and he enjoys a higher view than some connected actor.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible position.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nicked and lifted the thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
This command is similar to this one: here with Tor two!
The implementation remained.
“There wasn’t anything nice to look at today,” said Marcell Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt, too, would have wished it “disturbed”
1:0 (1:0), the Hamburgers owe it to Mladen Petric's headball hit (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
“It was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol co-founded.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the viewers celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash tables on the video wall, which proved their association to be a class primus.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to order this,” said Marcell Jansen.
He believes that the tablelar intermediate action is more of the League's incalculability than the dominance of its HSV.
The team, with their late mandatory accesses - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the gatekeeper Petric and the Jansen driven off by FC Bayern - are slow to shine, but they may not yet.
“We need more flair and more dribblings,” Jol asked.
After the defeat of the vote
At Wall Street there is fear.
First news of the failure of the rescue package allowed the Dow Jones to break down by 700 points in time.
This was the biggest loss of points in one day in its history.
Later, the dow got something again.
At 20:30 p.m., the world's most important stock exchange barometer with a high rate of 5 percent in the minus was recorded at 10,579 meters.
The Nasdaq technology network was 1548 points in the minus with more than seven percent.
The most important loser was in the Dow American Express at the time, which grossed almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around twelve percent.
No title could be won.
Bank Goldman Sachs's shares dropped by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, large investor Warren Buffett was involved in the company.
In the context of the rescue plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called falsified mortgage papers are to be provided.
However, the sum should be paid out not on a stroke but on a step-by-step basis.
In return, the State should receive financial companies stock options that could be triggered in the event of appropriate price development in order to reduce the burden on the State cash.
Stock rates in Europe and USA in downwardsog
The billion-dollar aid for banks in Europe and the United States does not solve the doubts of investors.
The stock price of the German Grand Bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls down the Dax.
The U.S. Index Dow Jones is losing in spite of the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses from the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have cut the German Stock Index (Dax) deep into the Minus.

The Dax slumped clearly below the psychologically important 6000-point mark and noted with a minute of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Worldwide, the stock markets went into the knee.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s 700 billion dollars of heavy rescue package could not be enough to resuscitate the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first trading hour to 10,809,25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.

The trade and tourism group also announced that the shares of Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter affects flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has been providing advice: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativism could not be completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe \"Ulysse\" flew through space.
Because of soon freezing fuel lines, you are now threatening the cold death.
For years, scientists have been providing a mysterious phenomenon for confusion - the swing-by-anomaly.
Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes where they receive additional movement in the gravity field of a celestial body, such as Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the sun's sun's resolution.
What the researchers have been wondering about for years, however, is that the flight bodies do not behave 100 percent as they would expect according to the old age law of gravity.
Rather, it results in irregularity in speed.
The probes are expected to be faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativism, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, could not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study still firmly believes that Einstein did not err, and tries to explain the swing-by-anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers in the universe have made up.
“Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth,” he writes.
From the existence of dark matter, space researchers know only about ten years ago.
It is obviously an attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, in particular no visible light.
According to scientists’ calculations, the dark matter is at least a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Abducted tourists in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists who had been dragged in Egypt were to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had asked for several million euros of ransom money.
Six hostages were killed in a shooting before release.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
Money negotiations are already underway.
Deutsche is always in the vision of Kidnappern.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reportedly consistent with Egyptian state television, Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports of the Italian television station Sky TG 24: “Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are just checking her health condition,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions were well-off and safe, the Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
It is clear that the behinds of a shooting in front of the release of hostages remains unclear: the kidnappers, according to an Egyptian security officer, were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom, the official said.
It was only about receiving the hostages, when suddenly, this surprise came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and captured two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of €6 million from Germany; the money was to be passed on by the German wife to one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper “El Masri El Jom” told a German mediator that the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather \"brought to suicide\"
The years of abuse by her stepfather has led to a woman’s murder, a court has been reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after he had endured eight cases of sexual abuse.
The court in Truro learned that he regularly held his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a statement: “I feel responsible for her death.”
The court found out that Mrs. Randle was killed in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had grabbed her and tied her eyes before carrying out sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who worked for the National Trust for a large part of her time, was persecuted by the abuse she had been assigned twice a week.
Attorney Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been “emotionally dead” since 2006 and had given up “his life”
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she died by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the stepfather of his daughter, who wrote a letter of confession, which concluded: “I managed to hold her and connect her eyes.”
“I didn’t need them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death.
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: “They’re an extremely distant Fetishist and for their victims it must have been frightening, especially since she was only seven.
This unsatisfying story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would have ended in court if it hadn’t done so.”
He added: “I take to know what effect, according to the description of Stephanie’s father and mother, her deed had on her daughter over the years.
She would otherwise have been a promising, successful and happy young woman.
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet Officer, who lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged in accordance with the Public Security Act.
The man was deposed by the Ministry of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed out to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said, “They had thought that this would conflict internally with the Ministry of Defense and Cabinet.”
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned shall be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The royal prosecutor recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highest sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he moved contained classified reviews on Al-Quaida and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his house to a secret place.
Apartment construction companies see B&B costs in the eye
British housing companies could cost more than 80 million pounds after the Bradford and Bingley Bank rescue.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers.
Interests for this loan are paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was “unbearable” that the companies and their members should pay.
The 14 billion loans will ultimately be refunded if Bradford & Bingley’s loans are canceled.
But the interest rates raised in the meantime are calculated each year to those 700 financial companies who accept the deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved carefully ... are now called upon to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest rates for the loan will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies must acquire 81 million pounds for the first year’s interest rates.
Adrian Coles, the Director-General of the Association of Housing Construction Companies, told the BBC that he believes this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved carefully during the real estate expansion will now be called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the existence of records in 1945.
“We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives are available to protect housing companies and their members from possibly significant costs.
The interest rates due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will fall for a full year and that could be almost double that much.
Since construction companies are both non-cooperators, their members will have to pay for the costs either due to higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk will be five pence per liter more expensive
People in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced it will raise the market price of its milk by another five pence per litre of Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consulting company.
The retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Prior to the increase in prices in February, Jersey’s market price changed last year.
Bangladesh's former Prime Minister will defend bail
A court in Bangladesh has denied a bail request by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Their defenders said the court refused to have pressured bail over 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several sworn charges for corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released against bail in the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina was to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-based transition government grant her once uninterrupted freedom.
Correspondents say that although her detention suspension has been granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as part of her release whether she will be able to stay on free foot if she returns to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers state that it will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court’s decision.
“The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina’s bail bid because it says that she doesn’t have to get bail since she’s already on prison suspension abroad to be treated abroad,” Rafique-ul Huq said.
We will file a lawsuit against the Supreme Court.
Their lawyers request that they need bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheich Hasina is expected to return home after 17 October, an Awami Alliance Party chairman said on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the Army-supported transitional government took power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatments.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against themselves.
Fears of the Anti-Polio Initiatives in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children have not been infected due to the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations launched a vaccination program in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or hinder thousands of people carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses complaint in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its complaint against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing ITV station.
The Court of Competition has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to under 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the BskyBs share distorted the competition and allowed it to have a minor impact on ITV.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the competition authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB prepared doubts about the independence of the ITV, which prompted the competition commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, Consumer Groups and the Office of Communication Ofcom have objected to the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV is an unreasonable and overriding measure, especially because BskyB had announced it would want to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. prosecutors' case
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the announcement of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administration employees were criticized.
The report made criticism of the White House officials, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
The Special Mediator Nora Dannehy is now to explain whether the officers who were interrogated during the investigation had logged in the investigators to prevent the justice.
Serious allegations, including criminal proceedings, have not been fully investigated or clarified, the Inspector-General Glenn Fine said in his report.
Calling a specialist with the authority to force the witnesses to make a statement was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that state lawyers would be released due to poor work performance.
However, it was later found that the released prosecutors were not worse than many of their colleagues were judged, which caused many observers to view the announcements as politically motivated.
Some of these state attorneys were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressional members, while others refused to investigate the allegations of election fraud by Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are ordered to investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government.
You can be dismissed at any time, but you must not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has been placed under committee for the resignation and has finally laid down his office.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also announced.
The General Inspector’s report has, in particular, critically addressed the role of Gonzales by taking the “main responsibility” for the discharges, giving up his leadership role, and showing himself in the process, which is normally of interest,
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loafs epic song to be honored
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honoured during the music award-winning \"Q Award\" for his epic anthem \"Bat Out Of Hell\".
The singer, who will accept his special gold prize in London next week during the ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loafs hit album from 1977.
“Coldplay” leads the nominations for this year’s award after coming into the closer selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine Q Magazine - Paul Rees said there were some songs that went beyond such things as time and genre and “Bat Out Of Hell” was certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a powerful voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell spent about nine years on the charts and sold more than 40 million worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, including surgery in 2003 due to irregular heart beats after he broke up on stage.
In 2007, he had to quit concerts due to acute throat inflammation.
Later it was announced that he had a cyst on his vocal band.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main traffic streets, alone, side streets and other surrounding streets, some of which are only convenient.
However, even for experienced taxi drivers and longtime locals, it is difficult to say where extra place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in East Village and runs from First Street to North between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty street than after an actively used road.
There are no road signs either.
It is virtually impossible to find them on a standard road plan.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to create extra place new pflasters to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other worshipers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short street, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
But the city administration department responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and responsible for the road has no interest in receiving them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the City Administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
However, the committee prefers that the road remain in the city’s hands, and has asked for a new plan to be submitted in the coming month, said Susan Stetzer, the district representative in the municipal council 3.
“Only very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to be part of the city,” she said.
“There could be offers of how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to remain guaranteed.”
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street would be remodeling plasters and seats, which, among other things, are intended for a café that the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman from Avalon Bay, said the company wanted to use the road, but it doesn’t necessarily want to own it.
“The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this fallen street and make it a public meeting point,” she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson for the Department of Building Protection, said it had actually been the city’s desire to sell the road and emphasized that the department’s task was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to his colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has preserved some of his historical impressions.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to the extra place and the street is certainly most well known as the setting for the photo on the cover of the album 'Rocket to Russia' by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of strings, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers writing about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare thing — a practically unchanged splitter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called “Jeremiah’s disappearing New York” (subtitled “The Book of Complaints: A bitter nostalgic look at the dying city”), has published part of the conversation of city history about Extra Place, which appeared in the magazine “The New Yorker” in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: “Extra Place is a small narrow bag of gases that lasts even during the day and is marked by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and weekly newspapers flying past rains.
With a few exceptions, the street looked exactly as it did in an evening.
A rat ran through the back part of the road, not far from the door that led to the CBGB, where there is a more expensive clothing business today.
Graffiti was visible on the walls and an empty beer bottle was not far from a fresh bundle of arranged newspapers on the ground.
Some passersby said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be upholstered.
Fields, added that, in his opinion, some people underestimate the drive of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, moist, and icy.
Two-language education debate: education in the English-speaking environment
In this issue of the Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, the leading scientific staff in California Studies and Director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book “Not as well as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection”
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentions that “the probability for African-American and Hispanic students to successfully complete the school is lower than for white students” — which is true.
In order to close this performance distance, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends, among other things, a two-language transition phase in training for those who first learn English.
However, Obama’s question is whether his commitment to two-language education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the distance to school services.
As an example, take “Sixth Street Prep” as a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
However, in 2008, an amazing 100 percent of fourth-class students passed the state exam in Mathe at a good level.
In addition, 93 percent of children from the fourth year of school in English were rated as good.
This amazing success has been achieved by other methods other than those that are preferred by Obama.
The school Sixth Street focuses on review and exercise, on steady control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school is practicing the approach of training in an English-speaking environment. This is the point Obama should consider, according to school director Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of the English language in the field of teaching.
Mrs. Mikels, who rejected the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just recently come from Mexico. 12 months later, one would enter the classroom and no longer recognize him.
“It works,” she noted, “it works for us.
Would Obama take a school like the “Sixth Street Prep” as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English learning students?
The school's performance would make it easy to answer this question, but the educational positions within its own party (the national image-unsanitary associations have long supported the idea of bilingual training) and its own consistent support of bilingual training make predictions about Obama's response uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the \"only English\" laws.
Instead, he said, “You should make sure your child can Spanish.”
If Obama actually wants to close the performance distance, he should take careful into account educational models that work, rather than despise and trivialize them.
The oil price is falling as a result of further fears of the economy
The oil price on Monday due to fears that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets could not be rich enough to revitalize the economy.
The crude oil-term transactions at the New York Trade Exchange fell by 7 percent in the morning session to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken both by the financial turbulences on Wall Street and by powerful storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month to rise again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were again concerned, although Congress representatives had announced they had agreed to a rescue plan on the weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This message was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was still far from over.
In the previous last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, Citigroup is going to buy up Wachovia Corporation’s banking business.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourgian governments have partially nationalized the European Financial Group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place on weekends and led to a rescue plan, it seems unlikely to be able to live up to the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
In a communication to investors, analysts from the German Bank have written that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
“From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the U.S. virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China.
Bank analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to poor economic growth for the coming year, and reduced their forecast for the 2009 oil and gas price by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Inside defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he had appeared more often in the Jets jets in the last eight and a half years than anyone else.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned a resultless game into a triumphal move.
“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Ellis said.
After a clever game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to a afternoon at which their developing cooperation made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which one time kicked out as an external defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of half time.
“I didn’t work very hard,” Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
“He’s a super player.
Our vote has voted no matter what people think.
While Favre and Cole's catch played, the defense quarterback Kurt Warner separated.
Outstanding Darrelle Revis started a crashed throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came on another pass and started off.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the most crazy.
The Cardinal had captured the ball with another 10 seconds left in the game when the jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20-yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were most of the points the jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets, answered the second quarter or the third quarter.
On the answers both, because the Jets left 21 points in the third quarter without reaching a single, Mangini said: “Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been reached in a short time.
Exhausted Gebrsselassie beats its world record
Haile Gebrsselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some think him to be the best long-distance runner of all time after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to reach the 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course at 2:03:59, Gebrsselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrsselassie, 35, has thus set up his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has reached a world championship title or set a world record on each track from one mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrsselassie left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing out of fear, which may have been exaggerating in the aftermath, that air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the target - Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since railways like Gebrsselassie and Paul Tergat changed from Kenya to long-distance, the record time for Marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo won Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Geberselassie reported to the press that he had scratches in his Wade two weeks ago and could not train one week.
Apparently, he has been refreshed after a break and has not come back in.
“I am so happy,” he told reporters.
“Everything went perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and still had some concerns today, but at the end of the day everything was super.
He has been criticized for this, especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s rivals from East Africa, for orchestrating his race runs excessively, generally avoiding many world’s best marathon stars, relying too much on the race leaders as if this would be a track race, and putting world records on the competition.
However, this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner.
Joined by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrsselassie had reached the center of the route at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrsselassie after the pacemakers left.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrsselassie made his last appearance to separate from Kwambai, who arrived as second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third in 2:07:48.
In the case of women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Deutsche, has completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh-fastest result of all time at 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She planned her run by leaving a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners only to leave, but overlaid after 30 kilometers.
Ascal Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the Strapas in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the expansions of leisure parks in the vicinity of Orlando, a few miles away from the glistening, loud and gigantic drifting, is a quiet city in which the pride and complications of African-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first black city in the country and the home city of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: “The city with 5 lakes, three crockets, 300 brown huts, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prisons -
Today it is a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, it remains and remains the city it describes - and which made it a tourist destination by taking it to the Florida Travel Guide, which was produced by the Federal Writer Project at the time of the depression - in many respects is a place of the very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, divided, and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who “knows so little about us that he does not know what is going on.”
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation on racial relations, many continue to be watched by outsiders.
“We are very concerned about how our history is told,” says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a member of the town’s oldest church.
It has to be voiced.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the average country.
It is, on the one hand, a high-rise of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the black culture of the rural south that has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents are both proud and on the hat.
And so the concerns about Eatonville's image actually began with Zora, as all the Hurston here call it.
She presented her hometown to the world in books that were from the heart and written in mouth, such as “Mules and Men” (1953) and “Their Eyes Were Watching God” (1973)
Five references in the Florida Travel Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road leading through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Freak like Oskar both in real life and in literature, Hurston led reader to the shop of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
“Aside from the street to the left,” she wrote, “the brown-white-infected modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, is always concerned about Howard Miller, though he can hardly read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn “sold drinks of any kind and that what-even-always fits into hourly rooms”
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
“Zora described the things as they were,” said Ella Dinkins, 90-year-old, one of Johnson’s girls, who had endured Hurston by citing the men who sang songs about her beauty that were full of sexual play.
She added, “Some people didn’t like it.”
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston broke into the city, she did this mostly without warning, in a lazy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that even today is somewhat enchanted by their honorable style of dress.
According to Mr. Franklin, most residents were fascinated, whereas many despised them.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Mr Franklin said.
But “she never stayed too long” he added while squeezing in his chair, on a rear terrace overlooking the Sabelia Sea, in which Hurston was probably baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were seized.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no great commemoration, no public readings in great style.
“I don’t think they understood their contribution in the world or their heritage at least,” said Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-way highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-way main road of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
“At that time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the sitting people,” Mr. Franklin said.
“There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car.
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s claim to force integration by calling his decision against the school council as ‘political rather than respecting my race’.
Residents today say that although the elimination of racial separation has been positive in some respects, it has weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-awareness of its young people.
\"Black children were used to getting ensnared - I remember - they hugged his teacher in the morning and hugged his teacher in the evening - said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and manager of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came out of the same place.
“You didn’t embrace his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural gap,” Ms. Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have contributed to the creation of room for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who sat down on prejudices, as they did, with positive self-awareness and statements like: “How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand,
In 1975, writer Alice Walker made his way to Hurston's unnamed grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the book's shelfes, making it a part of the American literature canon.
The remote road project came at exactly a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter once again stood in the light of the public.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a rescuer.
The community began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could do with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
Some years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
“The plans of a five-lane road caught the city, accelerated the whole with peak speed, awakened real citizen pride,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd expressed it a little easier: \"Zora rescued Eatonville\"
The victory against the remote road project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
There were more and more trailers, such as Rachelle Munson, an attorney who has been going to the church since 1993, and locals began to re-estimate the past.
Eatonville was admitted to the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly patched and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre of Orlando can sometimes feel like a back gases in the summer rain, as small as it was at the time when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is now 90% black.)
Outstandingly looking for the history of Eatonville and its meaning are often treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval in advance is necessary and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church painted by a white man and representing black men at field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew bigger, an increased degree of homelessness was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw its entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and fluent, albums and meddles like any other race and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who had previously returned to Eatonville after college, to work in the city administration or the police, which, according to him, could use some help.
And even the disciples, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people who go through here will think, ‘Ah, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’ Alondra Kenon said on a Sunday after the church.
“But when you actually stop and look at your history for a moment, it’s a very nice city.
Here with us in New York, we speak fluently of financial latents.
At first glance nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept themselves away from the newspaper stands and the huge television screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t even notice that they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe box-like offices with the glass façades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, the worst horror workday ever since the fall of 1929.
Suppliers are still pushing the metal tea weights along citizen's bar and transport tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still slams between apartments around how human pack animals loaded with around 50 t-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for food stands on their breakfast table and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 16 and 19.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon due to all of the world’s decline talk.
Although I had decided to put my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal branch, about 20 people were already in the snake.
Not to the money switchers to raise or deposit money, but to the customer service desk where tribal customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for the way to Macy's shop, and where new customers open accounts.
Most in front of me, I learned later from Starr, my “personal banker with license” stood for the same reason as I was a snake.
Unlike me, however, they had already lifted their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had raised money from so-called Thrifts (a little like a building parkasse), cooperative banks and those local savings, which only have branches in one state, and say they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silent and quiet.
Over the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with facilities of $327 billion, went home in bankruptcy management over and as late Friday New Yorkers over weekend, was Wachovia, another bank that owns savings assets worth $440 billion, looking for a rescuer.
In the fear of another collapse, the office and shopkeepers, who were in front of me, brought their bares to a bank that is considered a safe port, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
The New Yorkers have been able to get the most of their financial latents in recent weeks.
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese tribal supermarket took with so much trust with respect to Lehman Brothers, the Pleite gone bank, and their disembarking CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were lying about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniform concierge of my living block, has come from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food supply.
“I now have all my savings in money market funds,” she told me after my visit to the bank.
“I’ve changed, I’m not going to risk anymore.”
Muslim tombs barred during legal riot in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian Liberal Party of Austria, and Filip Deventer, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 to represent the organization's cities against Islamization.
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed by a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of grave damage at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, and on the same weekend at the extreme right-wing party of significant profits in the parliamentary election of the country.
On the night of Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun near Linz were seriously damaged in an action, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Star on some of the graves, but the criminal officials consider this an attempt to veil the motive of the extremists driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesperson for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply shocked” by the news of the grave damage that took place when the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan is close to the end.
At the same time, in Austria, there is a round of conscience research after the country collapsed to the right in the current parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, which the two far-right parties got the almost 30% of the vote, set themselves up in their election campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law, and some of their electoral claims were criticized by opponents as foreign enemies.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the vote, set out to ban headaches and burkas and even announced his hatred of food, which is generally associated with Islam.
At his last announcement in Vienna, he spoke of a “European Brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarettes with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses conducted immediately after the election, stating that the extreme rights of the most politically strong block in the country, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel barrier for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who was convicted of sexual abuse of children, was convicted of travelling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month lock on Glitter after he informed the authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Last Thursday, the police in Kent were allowed to hang a foreign travel barrier after she submitted to the judges evidence for Glitter's prep sentences for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name of Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court of Justice reported: “On Thursday 25 September, the police asked Kent in the Ashford Court to prevent foreign trips from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present.
According to the register for sexual offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a five-year prison sentence.
Police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitters' possible location in the country.
A spokesperson for Kent's police unit said, \"The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad.\"
“Our view is that it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively avoid any potential risks,” he said.
“It’s the top concern of the police in Kent to protect residents of Kents and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sexual offenders in the country to minimize any risk that might exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he planned to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn’t feel comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after some time.
The Chinese authorities also refused his entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Court in West London, because Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Jacqui Smith was calmed and satisfied that Glitter had been held off to travel to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No clothes, no clothes, no costumes for the appearance.
The nature of the great flame-cots, which give way to concentration and dedicate themselves to interpretation, in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand artists
On the other hand, personality
I look in private life, in these moments that are foreign to the public, I know when I can find typical gesture for the personality, the depth of a stolen look or expression of the hands that are concerned because they won't enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', German photographer Günter Bauer presents a variety of theatres on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flame coding at different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the program of the month of the photography of the flamenco,` reflects the international importance of flamenco growing from day to day,' the artist explains and makes it clear that `flamenco-people' can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notes that there are no typical images of artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to be able to hold the personality of these artists, you don’t have to take photos on stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What interest me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to hold the characters of the greatest flamencomaster with the camera.'
Bauer, inspired by the Festival `Cante de las Minas', made a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the camera's image sorting function and the existing material, images were created that remind of classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classic foundation of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea as the builder understands Flamenco: `Music with traditional roots that change and surprise every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essence, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, and was the firm aim of this work presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Known personalities in Flamenco including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrigano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to re-apply this idea two years ago and to perform as a 'portrait of the veterans of sports' (\"sportARTproject\").
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenko-people' are different, the photographer says, 'I like to photograph people, get to know them, and put me in their state of life, be it for a short moment or a longer time.'
I think in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult type.
You meet or touch people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to achieve my ideas.’
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco of today entitled `Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he just writes is 'a toll of beauty'.
He does not yet know where the action of the novel takes place and what it is about, but, Mario Vargas Llosa is constantly trying to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon area.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project he is engaged in is ‘a toll of beauty’ and ‘everything points out that he should not write the novel’.
‘If I were to be special, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel at some point,’ he concluded his participation in the festival, where ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days, he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding characters at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, the premium of the festival Hay Festival and giving the most attendees their voice, is compared to the old edition of `Our rational friend' and is seen at the theater Juan Bravo.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and noted that he had an audience before him who noticed that the Peruvian who has a wonderful memory and great sense of humor was not given enough time to be able to go through everything once again: how his appeal to literature emerged from `extreme adventure', from `peace at reading' and from `more than 'perceiving'; how he writes and `disciplin' to complement 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions that he does; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influence his profession and who are 're mind' are the foundation of his stories.
The Hispanic novelist boasted that there is `no way' where one measures and where one can know whether books change life, `but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a volatile experience', Vargas Llosa emphasized, who claims that it is `effects' and `brings people even more apart', so I asked the writer `don't leave the light' and `the responsibility' for his vocation `take'.
At the party in Pozoblanco the weather did not play with: Bullfighting festivals fell out in part.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the staging festival with which the festival should be completed in Pozoblanco was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus the organizer, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to move the staging party.
So the celebration of the unstoppable weather was suspended, so two of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, it rained, which was why the second planned bullfight festival could not be celebrated.
The group of Matadore consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who eventually entered the Stierkampfara.
There was only one celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed after leaving the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the Stier, which he did more by Galopping than by his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, a large part of the audience responded in his second fight with Buh calls.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago.
Transport controls in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers called for the driver of the car to stop, after which the flight took place.
It looked like they had to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police pursued her and arrested one of the drivers, the man, who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as it told the interior ministry of the Basque State.
The arrested person was charged with drug trafficking and cancellation of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the Álava region’s transport police had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police began the persecution until the car remained on the edge after a few kilometers. At the moment, the drivers went out of the car to escape over a rural road into a forest area.
In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was seized by police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later led to the exact laboratory analysis and to the removal of the bundle to other police stations.
In addition, officials found that the mark was 'doubled' so that it did not agree with the identification given in the vehicle papers, which is why it was additionally arrested because of the availability of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza carry out the investigations to carry out the arrest of the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to flee, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A. A. J., who was arrested, was brought to a police service, and in the next few hours he will be presented to the arrester.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, who is known for the role of Amanda in the series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, due to driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A witness observed how she was trying to drive out of her parking lot in Montecito in a rather strange way, California traffic police spokesperson for the magazine `People'.
The witness explained that after 16:30, Locklear \"pressed through gas pedal and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward from the parking lot, and when she was driving back, she grabbed herself several times on her sunglasses.\"
A little later, the witness saw the actress, who initially had not known the actress, that Locklear was on a nearby street and went out of the car.
The witness was the one who notified the emergency service because she had been ‘anxious about Locklear’s life.
When the police force arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street, thus blocking traffic.
‘They seemed to be unoriented,’ so they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol center to make a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress showed collaboration, excessive use of alcohol was excluded from the first moment. `The first observations of the officials followed, we believe Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', according to the spokesman.
Locklear was suspected of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance that could not be determined, arrested and brought into a local investigation by 19 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic after a treatment where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the head coordinator of the VL and MP of the United Left, has today assured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one who will make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, which has resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family citizens.
‘In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who must assume the jurisdiction for this,’ Llamazares pointed out what action the party must take against the one who has so far been sitting as a city council in the Municipal Council of Seville.
Despite this, the president of the VL defended the necessity of ‘trouble' in the possible investigations of the rule violations that Silva could have begun: ‘The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency’.
With regard to this subject, he emphasized that education ‘has a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
`Sangre de mayo': Heroenbuch von Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci represents in `Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the Spanish's famous revolt against the French. This is an amazing film in filmography, with around 15 million euros of investment for filmmaking.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to show ‘a lot of personalities and social analysis’, which he has always admired at the works of the famous novelist, Carci today explained when presenting the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday is presented in cinemas and later shown on the telemadrid transmitter as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to this film his ‘Kinness Dream’ was fulfilled, he thanked Esperanza Aguirre, who appointed him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid to film a second century celebration in Madrid. Especially because the story was based on `Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the assignment.
The total contribution of 15 million, made by the autonomous community of Madrid for rotation, offers Garci, as he added, the ‘one-off opportunity’ with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing, the picture of the ‘confused Spain who chose the wrong leader for the fight, because the people had been set back by the struggle for independence and the rule of Ferdinand of VII.’
However, the Cineast regrets not being able to expect funding such as at `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as at `Sangre de mayo') so some scenes from the screenplay with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost all his career, could not be filmed.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in `Volver a empezar', has been involved in his usual activity: he turned to the stage to the actors with whom one must first try before you start to turn and to those who did not make casting, he appears to be ‘deceiving' and giving respect, 'a part of the director's profession is to provide assistance in the theater and cinema to know what happens in the cinema industry in which you work.'
Many performers to whom he strikes in `Sangre de mayo' must repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he has won one), believes and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. neither `Sangre de mayo' nor `Siete mesas de billar francés' nor finally the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
“At first you believe you’re working for the offspring, later you realize that it’s only for growth, and now you’re satisfied when you’ve produced another movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flame dancer from Seville honors a dancer who is also from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Katalane (Florençtórtola Ferrer) and mother-in-law (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the district of Triana and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters to emancipate the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and set for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her traces in the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe during the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
‘I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.’
‘We don’t try to tell you about her life, without keeping her Esprit,’ the flamencotant said.
Your dance grounds have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
'The dance of the butterfly' appeared to me, for example, like Guajira, or `the dance of the snake' like Tango.
Your dance has been sensible and I have been told that my dances are also in this aesthetic field,” she says.
The performance is based on two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel in one of her ideas, as he did in La Auerta abita; and with Flamenco champion Matilde Coral, who had to work exclusively with one of her ex-Americans.
Matilde plays tórtola, a very mature personality.
I'm happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.\"
The performance also includes musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he `takes over the role of the accompanying artist who were Divas, in which he always fell in love.'
This work also tells of the life of this woman, known in as far-off places such as India, the United States or Russia and also in Northern Europe, although she has usually lived in London.
“I wanted to recall her because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a certain era and whose works today no longer know how to appreciate her,” Bayón says.
The idea takes place today at 20:30 in the theatre Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is to commemorate the fiftyth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize of Literature and the Day of Death of the two.
Thus, `the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is completed with the new edition of this work, with the international convention taking place in New York, with the restoration of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia's House Museum and the hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and after which was in different places in Sardinia, is now reached and presented in the course of the international convention.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet more famous.
The U.S. can present itself badly without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This phrase comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in “sensation reporter” and came from the then ruling notion of American cinema, which was left behind, from all over the Americas to Newman with his exciting idea and followed her.
Look at what it cost her to give him the Oscar.
When he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
However, this was a big blow for everyone.
‘What a sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,’ said Robert Redford crying, ‘my life and my country were the greatest drollies of his life.'
No one was afraid to make fun of or exaggerate.
As a \"father\" of cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment when fear of terrorists and the collapse of the market, in which the U.S.'s low self-esteem is in the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If, in this hard time without virtue, few people you can admire remain, then you don’t necessarily need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he almost embodies a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was Richard Nixon's official enemy and suffered both losses and gains: from the foundation that has committed to fighting the drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage who died of overdose, he was founded until his own brand of home-made and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country where it cost him a lot of effort to resist a deadly diet culture.
A broad wave of wonder strikes home high over Hollywood without regard for nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person has died, but all the time.
The English director Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar award winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia, dared to describe Newman as his greatest inspiration.
‘We have left the attachment of all of us,’ George Clooney confirmed, perhaps one of the few who are faithful today trying to live as Paul Newman lived: receiving high demands on righteousness, leading a responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there is someone trying it, and Paul Newman was an example of this.
He divorced once and was then married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities to not be.
‘Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I filed at home?’ he often shrugged himself.
In heaven, he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“From all the major roles he played, to none he was as proud as that of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive opas and those of the philanthropist,” they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are inadequate.
Yes, the dream of many of us organizing some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, may still be 2016.
But I ask myself, ‘Are we prepared for it?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
She was referred to as the perfect street, and according to my assessment, she was the worst road with all the drum and down that there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if you were to consider the assessment and I could check it out would be something that clearly did not happen.
But from the beginning, we go through everything.
The nonsense starts with the ticket catch that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they already let you go, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the dust on the road).
So don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of just going there) and (after an infinite waiting snake) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it so that after the crisis, only small, much cheaper shirts were decided to buy from less fabric?
So well, things like these are a little thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from having to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting snake of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting has taken more than 35 minutes, which in the case of a road, where 11,000 people are expected, is incomprehensible.
Finally, as it was to be expected, the road started and we had not let our back bags lie ahead, even if it had once been successful, but getting it back would be even more difficult.
In addition, in this 40-minute waiting time for rain, it looked like it was trying to organize a popular uprising and overturn the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people pneumonia and some like me will not even appear at classification even in time because of this chip I got, I can already think that the exit was stamped off incorrectly.
Of course, if you asked me about a perfect road, this road would never happen to me.
So I think we will still dream long by a city well prepared for the Olympic Games
Microsoft looking for a (virtuelle) receptionist
At the ‘Emerging Technology Conference’, hosted by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, an essence of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which, however, is capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move on the company’s campus).
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, this ‘receptionist’ can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also arrange the guests after the talks in the groups.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not associated with the group that is conducting their conversation, and that no one is a company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressing
That's certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, such as the next version of their operating system Windows.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft’s strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial trash, they would work five times faster.
Everything is only one indication when you consider that Microsoft added some feature and \"Extras\" in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worthwhile
Microsoft has the right to lose the operating system gradually in importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrom appeared on the network, it was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Skillfully, many point out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work at the same time.
The operating system fulfills the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its ‘death’, not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention every time to the operating system, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and we spend more time surfing every day than in the ‘ window’ environment.
What are half of the applications available in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more about integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, without doubt, I'll give a little example of this.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreational rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A shield is attached to the refreshment drinker machine: `Your search. Our future'. It prints out a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees in Microsoft used Google for research on the network.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for a way to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso owned it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in ‘Blood Diamond’ by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in ‘The Pate’ by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to clothing a well-built parishioner.
When we start counting the countless stars appearances, we can go back to the picture of a very powerful man, with a pointed beard that had raised heavy weights in a hiking circuit.
Basically taken, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waistless.
The English languages call it `tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, surpasses all other brands.
First, because of his great name, although it is called in the narrow circle 'Marcel'. The legend tells that the name-sentence is linked to sports and came from boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' excels all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive Unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (cannot be seen) that these t-shirts have as a detail on the neck cut.
And pay attention to the Belgian company not only focuses on the production of ‘tanks’.
You also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton pants, t-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very harmful to use them as underwear.
They are very attractive.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mondica Cruz is charming, but full of joy of life.
At present, the Sisters Gruz take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
For Mondica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who maintain their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved her residence there, and also presented the most important awards in fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Mercyful and shy, winner on the short routes.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/Winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, I also attended the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner in Valentino's honor.
A very intense working time that is exciting at the same time.
You are working for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I am fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I am happy to go through a city and observe women dressed up, how they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe yes, but finally, everything happens in one and these areas have many commonities.
Since I was a little boy, I had been excited about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to kiss around my aunt's clothes and see her clothes.
It was great to go almost better than going to a leisure park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in lessons and in the samples to look into the mirror and feel good at it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you turn into the real performer role.
Finally, everything is connected to each other, it is so much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
Have you recently become 30 years old, and have you not been in a crisis?
Oh, what.
I feel better than ever, I feel good for thirty years.
I find the woman will mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer errors.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I made the things I wanted to do since I was a little, and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, do you think about becoming a mother, don't you?
For a long time, I have known that I will become a mother because that requires my body and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to let that go.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I don't worry.
I will convey to my child great happiness and educate it with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works you have participated in and the last year have been filmed.
This is the same and I want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediate.
I wish very much that `La última hora' and `A busca de la tumba de Cristo' are listed for the first time.
See how they liked you.
A few days ago you appeared on the walk with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's fine, don't say anything like that.
It’s not like I went on the walk to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, has simply called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity of their organization `Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection for Mango were raised to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don’t know Naomi’s good heart.
I, as the one she knows, would tell you that she doesn't vote.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this grandeur thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a handhold, I will do that too.
To support women in the third world, whatever is needed.
The motorists that can be recovered due to alcohol levels will have to install the ‘Alcolock’.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties due to the alcohol level, installs in his car this system, which prohibits him from starting the car in the drunk state. If he is alcoholized, then the car does not jump.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General. According to its information, it is a pilot project that will last a year.
The purpose is to resocialize the driver, which is why he gets a course for reeducation of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the Attorney General, according to experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute of Safety of the Automotives will also participate in this.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of motorists, who were shown more than once because of driving under alcohol influence, returned to control.
The ‘alcolock’ would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents autostart when the driver has made alcohol testing; or when an alcohol concentration is detected which is higher than is allowed.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are borne by those who impose the sanctions.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices will prevent up to 65% of regulatory violations in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to attack this behavior before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, a legislative reform can be realized in the usual way, and yet a reform of the fundamental law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still available in the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been built into some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
The House of Representatives will be voted out tomorrow due to the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without `peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40 a.m., at the time of the program, next to the presidential hangar of Benito Judgment de México DF airport, the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with the prince and prince of Asturias, landed.
The sun went down, but its rays still forced to use the hand as a sunscreen to see the royal couple who came out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before that, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and the princes of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so, there you can't take people at the airport at this time you're from here or so
No, she's the Spanish, but she's lived here for a couple of years.
-I'm so, very good
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and princes of Asturias are and know the importance of the journey.
There are many who wait in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including the military protection of 27 soldiers of the Navy, who give the honorary ointment.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the princess, with long hairs wrought by the wind, without ordinary ‘peep toes’, may have been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, smile at them and be prepared for the photographers in which the official outcome is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, she is waiting for a reporter from Mexican television who likes to make jokes.
The best premium of fashion
There probably was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there probably was no significantly excellent fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' to promote and internationally increase young fashion talents.
This is awarded with money price of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, had seen her drawings in the show window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris yesterday and almost wined due to the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company’s second largest business in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The biggest business is in London.
So many events have happened that are connected to the fact that you want to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart broken by the pain because his brother died recently, broke up. He wore the suit from the fashion house and had some jewelry items of ELAH that were stunning. He kept himself on the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of the Mango House, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalry so that he ended up with the Baron of Rotschild without Jacketts, because Jacketts had loaned them to the ladies.
On a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a room for ballet samples, so she got excited, remembered the old days, took a rod and made a kind of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace's premises, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to rejoice over the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always produced a stormy enthusiasm, and on Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bed linen and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, so is life.
1001 Council on Stress
There are not 1000, but one more way to forget chaotic life.
And even if there are few, all of them are collected in a book in which it's about how to relax. The book comes into the bookstores on September 30.
The keeper is a penalty when he sounds at 7:00 a.m., but even worse, the idea appears to come back into the hectic rhythm that demands the current life.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat the daily education and problems of turning off from the work world.
However, the number increases, not more and not less than 1001.
In addition to yoga sites, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott in the book represents the entire list of options that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called `1001 ways to relax' and thus the calm that the book gives comes into the bookstores of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Who thinks it is impossible to achieve peace in the areas such as workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual contradicts such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered as to how to stay in contact with nature or suggest the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your vein no longer rises to restore balance to the body and stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to add to the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some kids talk at night
I mean, not those who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case, you will be scared, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially among children and young people.
Sure, more than one of you was told that you had spoken at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (a time in life, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (every day, one time a week, one time a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no reason for this appearance.
Often associated with other appearances in sleep, such as nightmares, panicking anxiety at night, Enuresis noctura (beds at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be on very high fever, stress situations or overwhelm.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be that you speak quietly in individual words, whispering or it can be quite an opposite (crying, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the statement is very intense, it is recommended to watch the child and consult with a specialist to check whether a problem exists, which causes fear and this way.
We've said it's a positive disorder, so it won't be treated unless it's connected to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with the sleep apnea or with the stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple prevention measures:
Try not to exasperate the child before sleeping.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and something too wild.
For the nervous children to whom relaxation is recommended, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner peace.
This helps the child sleep calmly.
Once speaking in sleep, try to maintain peace.
Remember that it is harmless for the child, and the next day it will remember nothing that has happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will break it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it appears to be scary after a couple's appearance, it is recommended to advise or find out what reason the child has for fear.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child will not put pressure on it to carry out an assumption and get more information.
So you won’t be able to achieve anything because when the child sleeps, it’s unconscious and you can’t think about it.
In addition, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says it, so they are careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn’t tell the child you hear at night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that takes just a few minutes.
Illhäuser ...
After a long stretch of thirst, Illhuizen on the playing field is finally back on track.
Without much effort, the yellow blacks played numerous torchances and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, at which the attackers had difficulty showing their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kaufmann, whose television almost passed by at the angle, Illhausen should easily dominate the game, and it was only wonderfully done with a television, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the footstool to challenge Denmark's defence.
The enemy team blocked in the middle of the field and left only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The start of the second half was to be crucial with at first two gates fought by Riahi and Temporal, and immediately afterwards with the first gate for the Ill Houses by Marais, who was exactly right to take a ball back, which had been resisted in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the ill-husbanded goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck much longer and be sent to the bank about 12 minutes later, which required his teammates to continue to play a number of sub-games.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not face any major problems for an ill-haeusian elf, which was just a little setback in order to ‘tighten’ their defense, except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the late.
Sarkozy meets angry fisherman
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another departure to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked the entrances to several Breton and Norse ports on Monday, the French president decided to find himself in the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him `with a constructive spirit', and hope he comes with 'concrete proposals'.
The President’s visit takes place at the same time as a general meeting of the Crisis Committee, which was established by the Breton fishermen to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in diesel price, which has reached a record value of an average of over €1.14 per liter.
According to Elyséepalasts David Martinon, “the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their company become competitive again and secure the working conditions and payment of seafarers.”
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
Tuesday morning they started protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, which caused dust of almost ten kilometers in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break down.
The Quiberon Peninsula was bounded by a lock.
As early as Monday, seamen gave expression of their determination, from early morning to early morning, to tyres and pallets before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc demonstrations were held.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the sleeve canal, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fish catters did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manors of the trading ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of significant total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to await the course of the meeting on Wednesday in the Ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Guilvinec Crisis Committee must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the responsible members of the National Fisheries Committee who have not supported their movement.
‘The strike will continue,’ because ‘the fishermen will not go to Paris at any point’ and ‘don’t want to go to Paris,’ said Liliane Cariou, president of the fishing committee of Lorient.
The professional fisherman, who does not pay taxes on diesel, currently costs about 50 cents, but they believe that a boat's profitability limit can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.
Paul Newman
The unforgettable performer from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 from the consequences of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes accepted the film legend and the dedicated actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer holds its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the threatening recession, as a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, holds its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, re-signed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot from the Chinese market, especially for his aircraft of the order of size of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider dispensing more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the American International Group, supported financially by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering giving more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion it has been awarded.
AIG is ready to charge the sale of a large part of its businesses, beyond its life insurance at international level and its age provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG met Sunday evening to check possible sales.
No confirmation could be made for the AIG.
Among the assets that AIG might be separated from are its aircraft lease International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and its investments in private equity, FT continues to explain.
With regard to these sales, no final decision was made, FT continues.
AIG must quickly make the sales to pay back the loans over 85 billion, including the risk that U.S. authorities will receive 80% of their capital and lose current shareholders to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris meeting Historic morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to save banks, a historic fall in rates: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of almost 800 points, and the afternoon of 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
With regard to the points, the strongest case of its history (684.81 points) was previously recorded on 17 September 2001, the date of the fall in trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final pick-up numbers, the index is Nadag, mainly technology, to lower 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widely used index Standard&Poors 500 by 8,81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to save banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which would once again allow for stability in the markets, Wall Street, which had already been attacked at the beginning of the quarter, collapsed.
With 228 votes, on the other hand, and 205 on the other hand, the Members rejected the money he had asked for.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
‘Here is a bad picture that represents Congress as incapable of accepting a plan,’ said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
‘This shows how much the market counted on this plan,’ she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come ‘too late’.
‘If the project is actually sentenced to failure (...), it will be a quick task of Fed (the U.S. Central Bank, Anm. d. Red.) and other central banks to deal with the crisis, which would further limit the credit conditions,’ Brian Bethune, chief of economics at Global Insight warned.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, stressing the feeling of extreme urgency even more, ‘that every day that scatters, the ruin of a financial enterprise’ in the United States ‘brings itself’.
After Washington Mutual’s bankruptcy on Friday, the U.S. authorities plan to buy up Wachovia’s banking business through their competitors Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, an indication that the markets are not only facing an American but a global crisis, added the analyst of FTN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown greatly.
The revenue of the state cash in ten years has declined from 3.632% to 3.827% in Friday evening, and the income within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.35%.
Obama, winner after points in the first TV dual
Following the first debate of the two candidates for the White House from Friday, another to find out who had emerged as a winner from it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the night before the election of both Republicans and Democrats announced their own victory in this TV wave, which should be pursued by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain’s performance, although clearly not ‘brilliant’ enough to allow him to stop his decline in election polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which released an opinion poll on Saturday, which, according to Obama, is five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
In the still undisclosed voters, that is, those to whom it is now coming, Obama, with 39% as the winner, emerged from the polls, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his rival Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-seven-year-old McCain did not stop putting his undisputed experience in the field of foreign policy to the fore, while clearly stressing the ‘nativity’ of his opponent with regard to these issues, which were the center of this first TV dual.
`Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...', he stressed several times.
‘I don’t think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and the knowledge needed to become president,’ he also assured.
An attack point, which has been preached in the Republican polls since yesterday.
Obama himself emphasized that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and accurately without being brought out of the version.
He expressed his ability to make good decisions and renew the image the world has from the United States.
‘McCain has not yet understood Obama,’ he said.
‘During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,’ Obama urged in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in the streaming rain on the occasion of an election in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words ‘mediation’ or ‘worker’. ‘The financial crisis gives Obama, which the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy even at the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
‘The next week could be a crucial turning point,’ estimated yesterday by the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared the `good economic instincts' Obamas with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is ‘the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain’.
After stressing that he would even manage to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations at Wall Street, the Illinois Senator pointed out that creating a possible energy independence of the country and promoting renewable energies, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, had a top priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully consider the issues raised on the plan to save the financial market over $700 billion (470 billion) which was adopted by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
‘Have you noticed that an election took place in Minsk?’
Youth and opposition demonstrated Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Some hundred white Russians gathered Sunday evening since the closing of the electoral sites on the Minsk marketplace to protest the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results have yet been announced, many youths have come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: ‘The dictator shall resign.’
Some admit that they have not chosen at all: ‘What does this use when they do with my voice what they want,’ says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself to the foreign observers in the best possible light to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-profit of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the raising of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
‘We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the bill,’ lamented Juri Potemkin, a press spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogenic association of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us it is the executive.
When Members of the Opposition move to Parliament, then because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcast time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.’
The opposition is therefore guilty of getting involved in the political game, as dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
For if our economy, which is heavily owed to Russia, is in crisis and we do not reform, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.'
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe, which has pursued the election, does not recognize the election as valid.
It emphasizes that electoral voting numbers appear to be too high, and that the expansion of the voting bill in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has given the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that an election took place?, the leader of social-democrat Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, namely those who are the most likely to comply with the government's ideas.'
The silence of the night sinks back over the October square.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves for their success.
Subjection - From blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its establishment yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the world’s safest and most efficient blood banks.
And above all, she regained the confidence of the public, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves administered by the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross during the 1980s were contaminated with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and public dissatisfaction, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to bring light to the circumstances that had led to such tragedy and to work out guidelines to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever still hesitated to deliver his report, at the time several provinces put a committee on the legs whose aim was to develop a new system for managing blood preserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this assignment.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec took up her work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Due to the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and by working in this field during the following years, we regained public confidence,” she says, before proudly stressing that in early 2008 almost 94% of Quebec’s population now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, retains in the awareness that ‘distinguishing is something extremely fragile'.
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted in accordance with the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of beef madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, this woman who has been taking the lead since the establishment of 1998.
\"And we didn't have the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted to the blood.
So we refer to one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, which, according to one, is to apply exclusion measures if one does not know and if a disease only slowly progresses, as it is obviously the case in the Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood of individuals who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was accepted.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt of doubt, this disease was transmitted over the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution we applied has a sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid test (NST) that allows the donor to detect the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the previously used tests.
The NST allowed the incubation time to be shortened between the time at which the person was infected and that when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
Thus, the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to reduce the risk of transmission of AIDS via a blood transfusion to a considerable extent.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, this means that you have to distribute 12 million blood containers before someone infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood preserves each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs where HIV was transmitted via a blood preserve.
I think you can feel comfortable today when you get a blood transfusion or write down to restore health,’ says Hema-Quebec's director.
‘Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
It was not until last year that the Chikkungunya virus was found on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We need to monitor uninterrupted', Dr. Décary continues before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient care in addition to a safe supply.
“The need is increasing because the population is getting older.
As treatment for cancer treatment is more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donation network, which, on average, accounts for only 3% of Quebec’s blood donation residents.’
Any healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the appropriate criteria can donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who make their blood available are not accepted because they are sick with AIDS or malaria, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from blood donation for a year.
With this 3% we are able to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but especially to keep it and to make it become a regular donor.
Life today is so hectic that you rarely find the time to spend an hour on blood donation,’ Frankine Décary regrets.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec not only delivers blood-containers, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart folds, eye apples and skin, which are used almost exclusively in severe burns.
These tissues will be examined, processed and frozen before being interred with Hema-Quebec, which will also manage Quebec’s only public nabel cord blood bank.
In the umbilical cord, which was previously considered a biomedical waste, there is rich blood in stem cells that can serve to treat severe diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth nail-nursing sample, and we plan to reduce more than a thousand annually.
‘We should start to make it available for transplants early next year,’ Dr. Décary continues, describing this program of nabel snurblood reduction as very popular.
‘Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it,’ because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semifinals
Montreal’s impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 wins (4 to 3 with all the goals) against the Seattle sounders at the second and decide to play the quarter-final series at Saputo Stadium, where the overall score was counted, qualified for the semi-final round of the U.S.L’s first league outings.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro shot the crucial goal in the ninety minutes of play.
After a first half-time without a goal for both the one and the other side, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hit for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who turned to Matt Jordan for the sounders.
We remember that during the first game of the pre- and back-play series on Friday, the Starfire Complex in Tukrilla had introduced a 2 to 1 defeat in a suburb of Seattle.
In the semi-finals, impact will be measured with the whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to balance a 3 to 1 defeat in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps were still in the semi-final round with a total tortoise of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be set today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number 1 trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn drove forward the attack on the Panther from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the meeting, shot a goal, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass into this winning game, the fourth of the tricolors into six preparation games.
Kovalev achieved the victory by shooting the only gate of the entire shooting.
\"I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game so I feel comfortable.\"
\"He's fixed too much on it in the first half, Guy Carbonneau said.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a stormy accident.'
Charest set to the north
The Prime Minister does not refrain from launching elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the Liberal Party General Assembly ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (Left) tried to be elected in the present partial election.
`The course of our last major border in the north shifted: this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the Quebec Liberal Party General Assembly in Levi, following the guidelines.
During his talk, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, from Quebec were viewed in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large amounts as during the electoral period.
In contrast to the press, the Prime Minister refused to conclude that he would hold the elections this fall, even if he announced that his calendar was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision' that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic space' which provides an agreement with France on employment, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has often been mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches in recent times, the opening of the North - the northern area at the 49th degree - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the prime minister was limited to explaining why the north was ‘a jewel with enormous potential’, but no date, no investment amounts or exact priorities for the projects to come.
At most some views of what could be worked on: above all on water energy, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr Charest’s list, the north has ‘Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, Titan and even diamonds’.
This `area twice as big as France' `is nearby, is in Quebec.
It's not just close to us, it's within us', he emphasized how to show clearly that he is looking for a national foundation space to achieve.
Quebec has grown very much through its connection with the North, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique Quebecs, the James Bay.
'It belongs to us, it's our future', he added, after he had set up a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a portion of Labrador with which Quebec has always requested, the Prime Minister told the press.
This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a border line at which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity is given, I will retake that position on behalf of the government,” he said.
In addition, ‘with climate change we need to rethink our vision from the north,’ he explained and spoke about the north-west passage that will be passable due to the ice melt all year round.
In view of this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would deal with them very cautiously, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pecist MPs of Ungava) have already introduced advice to about thirty communities.
A Committee of Ministers headed by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Report and Ground Treasures) takes an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, ‘not necessarily a summit’, but an occasion when ‘one will create a common vision’.
The development of the North will be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The plan of North will be ‘controversial, regulatory and environmentally’, he promised.
Jean Charest described this ‘vision’ as if it were a continuation of those of the Liberal Prime Minister who were in office before him.
Like the liberals who were in office in front of us, we decided to turn the challenges into new growth and development changes.
This was, on the other hand, one of the themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party’s takeover by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename Beauharnois' power plant in Adélard-Godbut-Staudamm.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about Lesage, who has achieved the silent revolution and the stateization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” Jean Charest said.
The press opposed him to another, this time conservative project, namely the 'Roads to the North' programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In relation to the project Hydropower Staudamm Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stressed that its commission for 2012 was intended.
‘That remains among us, but I prefer to be there,’ he trusted his party members, which resulted in those accident storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has in fact not yet excluded the possibility to hold an election this autumn, which is possible to him from the law.
However, he emphasizes that his appointment calendar is complete, especially due to a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the Week gave the Liberal Party chief a platform of nationalist plans, especially from 'the Constitution' which was adopted without further delay: the PLQ specifically calls for the recognition of Quebec's 'speciality' in the Constitution.
You also want Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Broadcasting and Television, and that they have a veto on the decisions to be made in Quebec.
From the side of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were included with scepticism.
The chief of the Québécois party, Pauline Marois, has re-produced the policy on the development of the Nord-du-Quebec, which the government introduced in 2001 to Landry.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If she had done it, 'we would be much further today', Mrs. Marois judged on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed itself to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
‘But what we want is that this is not just going to be a big idea,’ said the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonest Land
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justiz' minister (what irony) in Harper's cabinet, was it that allowed himself last summer to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'damaged' for Canada.
This woman, who has led an unending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover up with reproach, says as much about the people around the prime minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We have to deal with a government that, as the only one in all the affected countries, has not brought home their countryman caught in Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even consider that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things that were being accused of him happened.
The only government, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and leaves a child soldier to forget it under inhuman conditions.
The only one who goes down to a judicial parody to assess the debt of the defendant.
Let us remember that, above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
This government also closes the eyes before the torture: it is not interesting that after so many years of the quake, a young adult will certainly be permanently psychologically broken.
We are not yet aware of this, but here we are experiencing a secret circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our ‘democracy’, this word that Harper is constantly wearing like a flag in front of her, and that sounds so nothing from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morals: a Canadian citizen may be arbitraryly abused, tortured and imprisoned, all the way to the well-dwelling of a chief of government, who is only supported by the minority to this day (may he belong to the minority after October 14th).
Many voters believe to find their salvation at a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has turned its back on the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this silence, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In her September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-General Director of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an orwellic logic that the world’s largest gold-winning society has sought a slanderous complaint over six million against three authors and a small medium-sized publishing house, with the aim of opening up a ‘public transparent debate’.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of slanderous complaints, but on the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely avoided by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to lead a public debate is to drive everyone into the ruins, who dares to represent one of their opposing opinions.
Just as the process goes on, the authors and the publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defenses and fight against an army of lawyers who are paid from the almost inexhaustible bags of gold mine.
The tactics of these unequal struggles are often to ruin the defenders in order to force a reasonable arrangement that makes the opposite side mundtot and also scares off anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have to present her view of things in public opinion.
Unlike what is going on and going on in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada debates are usually carried out by the exchange of ideas and not by buttoning.
So it would have been sufficient if the gold mine had published their books and files and opened a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent test teams that could have brought light to this question.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in public opinion and wipes out the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver explain how he can ask for a 'public' debate at the same time, while ignoring the opinions of the public?
Apparently, this word includes only the generous paid attorneys in the world of the Vice-President, and not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even liars have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand — or does not want to understand — is that the public, who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does this primarily because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a knebel complaint (in the course of the ‘public debate’, Barrick Gold has just raised a demand for the authors of Noir Canada, in which they demand that they no longer use this term...).
Apart from Mr Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s complaint is a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and the finding of truth that is fundamental to every democratic society.
It totally denies the right to quote credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that do not please the rich companies of this world, who else can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead them by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long known how to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate complaint clearly shows that, unlike what she says, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures that limit these kinds of unjustified complaints.
Rescue for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
The Bush administration and the leading congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan over $700 billion to stop the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months has yet to be adopted by the two congressional chambers.
The main contents are: better control of the plan's practical application, new mechanisms to secure the refund of public funds used, new provisions to prevent the number of homes charged due to payment residues, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the senior employees of the supported companies.
U.S. Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Republicans' representative, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good novelty, after a two-day Negotiation marathon.
‘We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective,’ said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
‘It happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis at Wall Street,’ the Democrat said.
“This is the basic point: if we don’t do this, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of Americans will be huge,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, out of fear of the effect that a new failure would have on investors’ mood.
The deadline agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two U.S. presidential candidates, who were only late in the negotiations, showed themselves to be advocates of the agreement, without failing to express their discontent about having to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, especially those that would allow the owners to keep their homes, and those that concern the salaries of the executive employees of the companies saved by the State.
‘If the taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures due to the lack of responsibility of certain persons, this is nothing to be welcomed for.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on the American television station.
When asked if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: “I would like to know the details, but I hope.
`The guiding notes I have read [show] that this is one thing that we all will need to digest, and with which we will be able to progress.
The option of doing nothing at all is simply not acceptable, he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at the money of taxpayers
He comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by placing a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of the risky mortgage loans (subprime) before extending to other forms of more common bonds (PCAA), and finally into a freezing of financial power and into the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs who failed the first attempt to reach an agreement last week.
Since Democrats have accepted that certain ‘toxic’ activities of societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not be bought, it is believed to escape the sack gases.
In order to round out the angle of view for all in Congress, one has also added an offer that, if the government should make losses with this program within five years, they can raise new taxes to regain its capital so used.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to be able to add another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by Congress in a re-voting vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that dividends it in the event of profits, and that can sell it again if the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to cease the payment procedures relating to the apartments linked to the real estate loans concerned by this plan, and also to set times for the refund and settlements paid to the senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the House of Representatives to vote on him today, and the Senate would then vote on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will receive green light.
In fact, more votes were raised yesterday against this project, both from the Republican side and the Democrats.
‘All obviously, Washington doesn’t understand us,’ said Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Chamber’s financial commission, his voters.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one who exists to ask the taxpayers for cash.'
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, leader of a group in Congress called ‘the caucus of skeptics’, represents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us to inform us: we ask Congress not to put pressure on us and carefully consider what path is going on,” he said yesterday.
At the same time, we again received evidence in Europe that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The entry of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refuse to buy up its competitor, which is in great trouble since it lost $2 billion in the crisis due to the risk-rich real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
\"This is not a lost money, said Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate, we receive an electoral right and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savings and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announced.”
During this time, on the other hand, the British government was about to state another bank put in distress by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank began to announce yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the UK bank.
After Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to state the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was long his Trump, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor free himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His fine feeling, his sensibility, and an obvious talent may have kept him as far from a position of power that brings the truly frightening monsters to the world.
But what a long run!
On Friday at the age of 83, Paul Newman, who died of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for which he was a sort of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the sprunging of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often results in wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as a son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
Its European roots should be one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
For in him was a whole country that was in love with the self-made man, in the fighter who was injured in battle in the Pacific War, studied acting in Yale in the early 50s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York City before he had success in the theatre, on television and soon in cinema.
Also, this man who fought for civil rights was the driver who became second in 1979 in the 24 hour race of Mans, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a record relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, too, the unknown facets of this mysterious, holding back, committed and in relation to the glamour of the show business disappear oversensitive star, whose mystery will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman put the cinema lovers in Taumel this weekend, while on the dark screen of memories all his major roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change is moving ahead with it.
The charming cowboy once again comes back to memory from “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” (1969), and the young man who turns his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) back to The Cat on the hot sheet roof filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It will awaken a much shorter back-to-back memory, which will be at his sensitive Mr. Bridge, which will be disrupted at his age by a wedding that did not fulfill all their promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Like Me (A Hand Full of Drunk) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, was re-recorded after his death and made the Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic ganove in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oscar in 1973 for the best film.
As a bitter and arrogant billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, it was him.
He's still.
In his course of life, eras unite.
The youth knows him primarily from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little Orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Brothers Coen in 1994.
With a final role in 2003 as the patron of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the county closed.
In contrast to several cinema legends who have retreated early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his wealth, his prunk and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the ‘underplaying’ when he gave his all-out-of-print performances.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to which the roles only flowed for a long time.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, fissures, or desperate ones, with whose perfect representation he reflected his abjection and rejection.
As director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true fine-feeling sensitivity.
His 1968 Rachel (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) and his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine woman portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of warmth and sadness.
In the flood of honours, which took place yesterday over Newman ergoss, his close friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared: “His presence has improved my life and this country.”
Greed and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, he is now a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of abducted Hollywood.
We may have seen him with his foot in shells full of vinaigrate, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this to be quite tasteless even though we initially found it funny.
The profits from his turnovers still turned into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: “Immer and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.\"
And for us, it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the closest and the widest sense.
What was produced in the accounting factory of Ingest &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, negotiations in the criminal proceedings against János begin to strike and its complicity.
In particular, the defendant is accused of participating in organized crime, as well as gross negligence of injury and business fraud, and other criminal acts, among other things, of falsification of documents.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the funds in the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often set up with fake invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - total of HUF 65 million - are to be partially included in the funds of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, in part in the private funds of individual persons.
As the investigation authorities announced, fictitious bills were submitted when referring to tenders, and the associations were not to fulfill their obligations.
According to the indictment, much of the invoices should have been faked.
The billing blocks were purchased at the market of Józsefváros, the round seal being made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies should be issued the invoices was made on that round trip north of Lake Platt, to which István Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this “exclusive tour,” Lados would have to find out pensions and restaurants.
He requested bills on the consumptions to be able to exhibit later on these proposals based bills for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social and Labour, as well as the self-management of Budapest.
These invoices should have been mainly manipulated by István Lados and his complicity, András étri, the latter of which should have been responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports according to our information.
One of the goals of Lados' \"Courage to explore\" was a beer resort.
As two invoices issued by Ingestion and Co in 2003, the gastronomy company is expected to have managed the ninety-six heads group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the head of the company indicates that such a large group would not have fit into the locale at one time.
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002, on the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed grave form and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are expected to have stopped.
The imagination of the billing falsifiers was not set as well as any limits when it came to the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company in which accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not appear at all, according to the prosecutor.
As managing director Győző Farkas told hvg.hu, it was immediately clear that it was fake documents when he was submitted by the prosecutor during a survey document.
“Our company name and tax number were misplaced on the stamp,” he said.
And further: Apart from shape flaws, the fact was also false that the operation should have housed one hundred people after having a total of eleven rooms that would not provide room for so many people.
Even if the invoice had been in effect, the restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The embezzling invoicers have also refused to check that the Budapest travel agency they have seen only offers trips abroad, and thus they have indicated Hungary's travel on the cash bill, which also contradicted the accounting practice of the company.
As has been known in the course of the investigation, they have also applied the VAT to the invoices, although travel office services relating to a country outside the EU are tax-free.
The volume of VAT was wrong in all four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Foundation Jobb Jövőért, as the operation, rather than only 15 percent VAT, is also issued exclusively by the employees, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made by the “accounting armies” was that in one case they had given “waren transport” as a delivered performance, although this is not offered by the investment consulting company, the prosecutor told the prosecutor.
Further form errors - false accounting format, false stamping - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Egyutt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as XXI Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont, could be revealed as defendants.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and Kunfehértó sports camp, whose managing directors claimed never to have issued the invoices.
Another “fault” is the falsification at HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This society was at the time (2001) just in resolution, when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was to have eaten there - the administrator of the mass was thus determined not to have issued the invoices himself.
Invisible Fake
The other group of accounting armies are individuals who were very aware that they had to make fictional bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation issued bills for the Egyutt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, at an altitude of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of the Collab Kft. was transferred from one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to the exhibition of the fictional bills.
The biogate Kft. currently available in liquidation should also have worked with addition and co.: In 2003 the Foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület and Voorösfenyő Egyesület, was to have supplied with fake invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million, which are based on unearned services.
However, there was also little payment traffic, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, which the affected have forgotten to notice in their documents.
The third group of accounting armies shall include persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the post-bot of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a yet undetectable fuel and vehicle trading company based in Budapest.
This company will have issued several invoices on the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF from October to December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is to have acted as a buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian to whom the company documents should also be delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigation, Kubatov has issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the Associations of Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have their countervalues cassed themselves.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are to be founded by Romanian maurers on Iván Kubatov’s explicit wish.
In truth, however, none of these companies were active, which was according to the fact that there were lack of orders.
However, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his complicity lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was assigned to prepare the company’s founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov is expected to have issued 15 invoices in the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The prosecutor believes that Kubatov could have cashed 10% of the invoice and VAT each.
Cubatov is even supposed to have abused the company Sci-Beri Bt. for the exhibition’s fictional invoices - in this case the invoices were added to the applications of Biztos Pont.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért made their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party in January 2006, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány-TMA.
Both received 500,000 forints each, but used these products for a different purpose.
To hide this, they have submitted five fictional bills to the TMA of the Works Team Kft.
By the way, these invoices were guaranteed in the Ministry of Education in the examination of the office of Árpád Kemecsei.
In the negotiations, it is now expected that some defendants will be charged with an opinion on the procedure of billing falsification, as they have already been filed before the prosecutorship.
A sensation could be if the main accused decides to strike János to a full confession.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he had already repeatedly promised to report extensively on everything, his confession is still standing.
The question remains whether this is in his interest, whether the socialists have completed a package with him with regard to the restitution of the bulk of the damage resulting from HUF 50 million, and whether extras in return are ready to assume responsibility.
It is quite possible, however, that extras now play the “accursed” after his quest for milking of the detention and house arrest was poured on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have suffered far greater damage from economic offences and who have not reimbursed them, are on a free footstep, or at least under house arrest, extras continue to resist this possibility.
The Psychology of Overdating - or Why We Are Ready to Pay More
In the case of increases, the buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the fail offer.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now managed to discover the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in Science magazine, people in a competition, such as an increase in eBay, do not want to be beaten and therefore are willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this game with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto while the others participate in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were investigated by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain ring, was measured in the event of loss of auction, in which the opponent’s overriding plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the “cell reward” of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore felt that the increase in prices could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to substantiate their thesis, the economists in the research group employed additional investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should compete against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group were also promised $15 reward, in case they emerged as winners from the game.
The third group received $15 before auction, which was also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was that the emphasis on one was on winning while the other was on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the “opposite losing” group were ready for higher use than those in the control group or the “winning” group.
“These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have been based on the behavior observed in auctions so far only on the joy of winning or risk prevention.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so that we now have a third explanation — Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at the University of New York, said.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor looking for?
Around half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C worldwide, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated to be hundreds of thousands, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often don’t know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for various viruses caused by infectious liver diseases.
Symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and yellowness are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread to two different types: in hepatitis A and E, by the digestive tract (for example, by contaminated foods or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, cervix or speicle).
Travelers are recommended for vaccination against the viruses A and B at any time, against the virus C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur about two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, stomach pain and fracture.
Afterwards, the yellowness occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the healing can take up to two to three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from hepatitis B, far more serious diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that estimates are based on only every 10th infection in medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: Untreated can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people don’t even know about their disease, as the pathogen destroys the liver cells home-to-home — in many cases, the first symptoms show up after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular control investigations, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who underwent blood transfusions before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
The number of chronic hepatitis C cases worldwide is currently estimated to be 200 million.
Since the disease can already be detected in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult the home doctor in the first signs of unknown origin.
In a timely manner, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thus banning the risk of infection and preventing the onset of cancer.
September 30 is the World Day of Hepatitis, 2004 for the first time in patients worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, its emergence and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research shows, religious belief like a kind of “cure agent” works, which is intended to facilitate the death of Catholic martyrs.
Oxford University scientists have conducted an interesting experiment: It has been examined how belief in God affects pain feelings of man, the British newspaper \"Telegraph\" reported.
In the course of the more bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists received electric shocks each while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
Through brain scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that Catholics could activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
The research was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university also participate.
In the attempt, a sparkling device was connected to the left hand, which delivered the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: for one image of the Mother of God, painted by Sassopherrato in the 17th century, and on the other Leonardo da Vinci, Dame with the Hermelin.
The researchers hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would create a kind of religious trance, while choosing the image there, because it was hardly distinguished from the other paintings and felt as soothing.
The experimenters each spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving a total of 20 electroshocks in four stages during this period, while either looking at the religious, or the other paintings.
The Catholics reported that they had felt at the sight of God’s mother, “in security,” as if they were “careless,” and they had felt “peace and rest.”
While considering the religious painting, they reported over 12% less pain than they had seen Leonardo's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the trial, said that similar effects could also be produced with other strongly acting images in the atheists, only to find the appropriate photo.
“We had to find a picture that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“Practicing faith should change our personality and do it in many cases,” Wright said.
According to these excellent results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna image Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you're telling about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can claim with fug and right: she can be found in the pockets of people as well as over her heads in heaven: she knows where people have spent their holidays, to which professionals they go, and what they are moving.
And so still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's CEOs.
In the direction of skeptics, who are plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he directs: these would just overlook the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently stated that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about the users and thus to get closer to the original company’s goal of “ordering all the information of the world.”
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished that Google would be able to answer questions like “What should I do tomorrow” or “Which job really fits me”, but software programs aren’t able to do it because they don’t know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet research, the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses that have been searched for, and the pages visited.
For example, the “personalized search” introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search and then to access it later, so that the matches can later be generated much more accurately, and the same logic is also based on the so-called “recommendations” with which the system recommends customised products and services due to previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a data abuse - “If you look at what I’m doing - some are concerned about whether the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that acts fearably, and less the sense of guilt or the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or the desire for power that happens to many Internet users for rejection.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of the incident, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected from the Community site called \"Orkut\" and also allowed for identification of the pedophiles.
However, in May, users concerned about personal rights could still breathe up when Google successfully went to court with the civil rights organization EFF: that is why Google cannot be forced to issue information to the FBI on a secret request with no point of the Constitution in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully produced the release of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms, referring to the youth protection law adopted years ago, but it has been kept the list of individual users, or their list of web and search terms, back to two months.)
So Google’s image remains controversial: Those who shyly release their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and intimacies through the use of Google’s services, shoot the company with the embezzlement paid by conservative companies.
On the other hand, American Geek culture, which is present in many countries, sees excited computer fans, activists and users join, the next generation of \"cool entrepreneurs\" in them, unlike Microsoft, who is a market leader, even though both struggle for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not require its users to request identification codes as opposed to Microsoft, and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program packaging seems far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the software giant’s official practices.
On the other hand, the Geeks look at the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet knife scarf - a relationship that has been at the center in particular in recent years thanks to the term \"Web 2.0\".
“Web 2.0” means nothing other than collaboration, speech, user deliberately leaving traces and using the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
At the same time, an average youth can manage his profile on multiple community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, it can connect to each other through other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can ultimately integrate this into a tracking system such as friend feed or blip.fm. In addition, they can conduct blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries that are geosted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove that when you look at the party photographs of last night, the girlfriend soon finds out who has enjoyed her unfaithful friend, or the employee will be released because in his blog, he only makes an all-honoring mistake about the management of the company - one is sure: the term \"Sphere\" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Anyone who conducts an online life is what he praises - such as you could form the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even go over the Google monopoly, can do so - like Scroogle, a tool that does access Google's search engine, but deliberately leaves no traces.
Not a few people deliberately register on community pages so that they can not be found, but also Google's online applications, such as text processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be used to deal with alternative versions that are not connected to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible user profile.
The public opinion waits for Google to show its true face.
With the current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense’s advertising areas threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the services introduced faster not only provide Microsoft but also other software developers with head breaks.
However, critical observers also find the disturbing counterpole: for example, the company management has completely rejected a protest of employees after the company’s own kindergarten fees were doubled, the management said that the employees’ multiple aid was too costly, but it all seems that in 2006 Google even went to the knee and agreed with an agreement to filter out all regime critical matches, or those that would violate the good taste.
The internal organisation of the Group is that no new service will be applied in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could re-enact some more forcefully: while some of Google’s book and magazine scanning or archiving projects are now taking measures that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are troubled by the system “Health” which enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database, the next generation of sci-fi authors is already providing the substance - such as “scroogled” the famous novel by Cory Doctorov describes in the best orwelling manner a future in which a person will be horrifyingly near thanks to Google’s data.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd in the trace removal
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two youths suspected of having helped in removing the tracks, the spokesperson for the police commissioner Borsod said on Tuesday.
The young people were faithful, and they are currently being charged with the aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, two girls defend themselves on a free foot.
Aid is threatened with a penalty of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having deliberately murdered several people out of money-hungry.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a 53-year-old a greater amount of money.
However, the suspect did not want to settle his debts, so he locked his creditor into a field in Ózd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act of long-suffering - this also proves the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the site.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the armed forces and the circumstances of their use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange offers purchase for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, have offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the hundreds of percent purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, rejected the offer made by Poland despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is completely owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, who, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily newspaper E15, Poland’s quote includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Stock Exchange have placed offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he also did not conclude that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the agreements of the shareholders, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The first owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent share, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, on Tuesday some leading European leaves already spoke of the “second September”
The global financial disaster we owed to the American president, for example, \"La Repubblica\" - the president has not even been able to turn his own party into one behind the legislation that should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor” like the billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to talk about a “second September.”
Part of the press in Madrid also ordered the Sinnbock in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is responsible for the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of the collapse.
The American financial system is increasingly threatening to collapse, and below it will suffer the whole world.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but now, after voting in Congress, threatens the risk that Washington has no political means of crisis management.
The world economy is hanging in the air, just at a time, as one of the biggest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
You can no longer ignore the threat, for example, the Genevaer \"Days-Anhalter\"
Even though some states could still provide their money institutions with rescue packages, and save banks with taxpayers’ money from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered, and more banks are still pleading, then no more financial injections will help, nor other immediate measures.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralize control of the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid for at weakening monetary institutions, and the Viennaer “The Standard” also reminds, as the newspaper continues, the concerns are more and more realistic that according to the Americans, European taxpayers now have to get a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not been seriously dealing with the crisis that is now fighting like a tsunami over the old continents.
However, the \"saviour\" would not immediately have had to settle with several hundred billion euros, in which case it would be reasonable to pick up the taxpayer's money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the hummel
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to avoid accidents if not to imitate the pollution sensors from nature?
For example, those of bees.
At the CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented in which the Nissan engineers were inspired by humbles in the creation of new preventable systems.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the biomimetic system controlled by Autoboters from Type BR23C, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In the flight, each bee forms its own, oval — terminal area — which is very similar to our own protection shield, Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, said at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers seized the idea of the laser-controlled distance knife.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field within 2 metres, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is registered in seconds break parts, and the autoboter immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
“If it wasn’t, the author could not respond quickly enough to escape the obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the “Mobility Laboratory” and the Autoboter project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are currently considered inevitable.
The entire process must reflect the behavior of bees when they alienate other bees.
This must be done in the fraction of a second.
However, the exhalation, unlike the bees, can not be done up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and it can only be in the direction of the veracity of the tyres.
While there are endless opportunities for bees here to escape other bees, the researchers were able to operate only the rotational movement, or acceleration and braking.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer life span than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent response, and less to the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store it.
This device needs to process only a few inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It does not have to store these, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction on the basis of previous maneuvers, so that it currently only requires a handful of KB of memory.
There is no need for a gigabyte and megabyte heavier memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision prevention technology, which, according to Nissan's assessment, will be serial in production over the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite configuration by deliberately directing the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the target.
A name for the sinful child
Now, the written version of the 700-year-old’s heavy rescue package law is available, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at purchasing the bad loans of banks.
In the first passage, half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time East Coast, after several-day debates, the Congress decommissioned to an agreement over the $700 billion heavy rescue package, Reuters reported.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the U.S. House of Representatives, and said that the agreement was only to be brought to paper.
The compromise on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said the programme will show effect and it will be efficient, but you have to do even more.
The written version of the package was yet to be published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8 a.m. (central European time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a high flight on the stock exchange.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first agree on the draft legislation on the stabilize of the 2008 economy, then the Senate will be on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
The program, however, waives from the Bush administration’s original recommendation, after which the $700 billion should be spent at once for the purchase of falsified, with loans of burdened securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after the Congress is expected to vote over the Causa on Monday. This sum is to be applied for the purchase of credit-taxed, poor securities, and over the other 100 billion USD is to be decided by the President.
The programme is reviewed by a separate Commission, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can purchase bad loans, mortgages, and mortgages-burdened securities, or other “toxic” loans.
As responsible persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be carried out both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the anxiety-stricken funds, and the companies pay the fees to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be provided as an emergency aid for the American financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the prevention of a system risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law once it has been signed, Paulson said.
However, the chiefs of banks that are in trouble and now relying on state aid can expect to be reduced by the government by their operations, which are called \"Golden Handshake\" in the overseas slang.
There will be a shortening of the salaries only in certain cases, and these shortenings will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The shortening essentially means that if the Ministry buys in an auction, the Golden Handshake is taxed unless the bank chief is expelled from retirement.
In the event of a direct purchase of the fake loans, the government will aggressively turn on itself to ensure that the managers will not be overpowered.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions only refer to new agreements, so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that shortenings are regulated by law in managers’ salaries, Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the measure.
The State gains participation rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers is reduced as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus also the saved bank continues to improve.
The bill provides that the President must submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: The measures were taken by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The prices in paper production, as well as in the publishing and printing industries remained unchanged.
In other branches of the processing industry, a price increase was measured between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the major domestic sales markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the price increase in gas introduced on 1 July.
Considering the domestic sales markets of the processing industry during the year, prices in crude oil processing have increased the strongest (32.4%).
In the metal processing sector, a 13.2-percent increase was observed while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11%.

No more visas to the United States from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement to enter into force on the 12th of January, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs told the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In your view, “all is now only dependent on whether the electronic immigration or control system is being introduced overseas in a timely manner.”
However, she also emphasized that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists will have to register in advance.
The head of the Hungarian Diplomacy is starting negotiations in Washington today.
She meets with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her over the “Middle Deservation Cross with Star” to the Republic of Hungary, and she also conducts talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion savings package for banks, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The Congress and representatives of the government, after days of marathon talks on Sunday morning, announced that they have come to an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the emergence of the frozen credit market became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain both claim to be better than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain’s High, who gave him the presentation of presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was fused at the same time.
At an election campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly accept the law over $700 billion heavy package.
He emphasized that the plan also includes the passage of consumer protection that he has supported.
“We need to act now, responsible (...) - your jobs, savings, entire industry branches, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened” he said before 35,000 viewers.
He did not fail to describe McCain’s economic visions as “obsolute.”
In an ABC-given interview, McCain said: “We’ll all have hard to cope with (...) but non-stun is definitely no alternative.”
The Republican Senator said that the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of the operations for top managers - something on which he has existed.
Obama said McCain would not have played a final role in the negotiations, but he, Obama, was in touch with the minister.
On Sunday, the spokeswoman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill on Monday.
German Press Show
The right bearing is intact, only the voters became more self-conscious within the camp - so commented “The Mirror” the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article \"Bayern's Revolution destroys their fathers -
According to the renowned politicist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein Huber duo took over its offices.
The Christian Societies have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
The break in the era is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
Amazingly, the CSU's disaster didn't come about, but on Sunday something ended, but it was almost ten years ago: the improbable hegemony of a state party.
For 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed 47.7% and fell below the fifty percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 federal elections, that is, in the much cited Stoiber era.
Modernisation operated by the CSU in the federal state has lost its own mothers and fathers in good time.
Sociologists had predicted this 40 years ago, but in the process was greatly estimated, but without any effect the secularization, educational success, the rise of East and North Germans in the prosperating regions of Bavaria could not remain on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization is always accompanied by an increase in options, and this has political consequences.
The right warehouse is intact - only the voters within the warehouse became more critical and self-willed.
It is remarkable that in recent weeks, almost all of the classical civil groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, commercial citizenship and voters with scholarship such as high school degrees.
Here the support of the CSU decreased to even under 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese Tageszeitung reports in its \"Who with whom? party chiefs holding back in coalition issues - titled articles on the chaotic domestic situation in Austria after the new elections.
The company wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the integration of the SPÖ into internal affairs.
The BZÖ shows itself open to conversations in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to establish themselves in relation to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates on public television, the chiefs of the party hardly looked into their cards.
SPÖ chief Werner Faymann expressed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very possible - in some federal countries and in the European Union, this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP chief as vice chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, voters would have chosen the bowl-molterer course.
A repetition of this direction does not come into question.
Molterer has responded cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann is trying to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or going into the coalition, it is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed in the Internet.
BZÖ chief Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
“To prevent red-black, we are ready to assume government responsibility,” Haider said.
Járóka: The Devil’s Circle of Poverty and Segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, which is now headed by the EU Presidency of France.
In his speech addressed to the Plenum, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz-Affiliated of the European People's Party, in particular to the education segregation, as it is one of the most serious legal violations facing Roma children, is also the biggest obstacle to their validity.
The high-ranking conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spiderla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Chance Equality.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil society in the field of equal opportunities.
As Fidesz’s press office reports, Járóka has noted that in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would primarily push out of the labour market due to its low level of education.
“The vast majority of Roma youth don’t have middle school education, and thanks to poor elementary education, only a small part of them can reach a university degree.
Járóka further emphasized that education is a fundamental human right to have a key role in the establishment of other human rights.
Investment in early training of Roma children can strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
It is important, in the opinion of the MPs, that these connections become aware of a wide circle, i.e. Roma and non-Roma, as far as possible.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the stronger his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and through income and sales tax, they make their contribution to national spending.
“As Union citizens, Roma must be assured the right to high-quality education — the bad and segregated instruction must be set up — according to Lívia Járóka.
As the MP explained, a joint, goal-oriented and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to accelerate the de-segregation process in the education sector, and proper compliance with the existing and planned anti-discriminatory guidelines is essential.
“We must break the devil’s circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a full-fledged citizen,” Járóka urged.
Since Congress in Berlin last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European level, but also national level, within the meaning of the European Year of Equal Opportunities.
CSU: Grace in Time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein is decided
Despite the election debacle roles, there are still no heads at the top of the Bavarian CSU, staff debates have been challenged.
Party chief Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein still remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem after the disastrous 17-percent loss of vote will be decided on the last October weekend on the extraordinary party day.
The much shouldered duo, however, had already come to realize that it does not want to stick to their chairs.
In this way they want to embarrass the angry group and the party base, which demanded personal consequences one day after the \"Bayerian tsunami\" in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, the Christian Social Union reached another 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was the sole ruler of Bavaria, which generated 18 percent of German GDP.
While the Conservatives remain the decisive force in the important southern federal country for the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party’s internal restructuring, potential successor Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Minister Horst Seehofer will also be integrated into the exploration team, which will lead to a possible Munich coalition with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing “free voters” on probe talks.
An irony of fate is the same as the list of “Free voters” that Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-stober appearances first took advantage of the Huber-Beckstein Duo to then unscathedly serve the goaltender politician.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its forces on the stabilize of Beckstein.
The former Prime Minister and CSU chairman called September 28 the ‘bitterest day of his political career’.
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic remarks towards CDU - his view that the CSU would have earned much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has also contributed much to the success at national level in 2005, is not put back on the legs with a joint act of force, Merkel cannot become a chancellor again after the September 2009 federal elections.
Merkel, who has not made a heck out of her disappointment over the fiasco, believes that the CSU’s loss of terrain will not negatively affect the large coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of social Democrats continues.
At 18.6%, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition has been able to enter the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this lies to the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suggests illegality in counting the votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognized the elections.
Although the legislature of the 10-million-member state has been unopposed for decades, the counter-party gathered under the name \"United Democratic Forces\" (ODS) has seriously hoped before the recent elections that Lukashenko, who, in the unscrupulous elections and thanks to a 2006 constitutional amendment, had already renewed his mandate for the fourth time, would \"let some MPs of the opposition in Parliament\" this time.
That is why the ODS has even distanced from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine, thanks to the rising prices at Russia’s natural gas import, is becoming increasingly dependent. For the relief of price increases, even loans have been received, and the country has also agreed to the sale of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline, which the country leads to the Russians. In the light of the opposition’s expectations, the hope was that Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukanko and other high-ranking politicians have entered the EU due to the EU’s anti-democracy political system.
A temporary relaxation resulted in the evaluation report of the OECD elections, where emphasis was on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, on Monday, the OECD's quick report criticized the campaign - which is why opposition members may not be present in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the countdown of the votes.
Despite all of this, the opposition may recognize an improvement in the political system: political prisoners were put at a free footing, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to reject the recognition of the independence of the southern Ossetians and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on the paper, has regarded the two territories as independent for a month.
“We have taken two steps forward and a backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” said Alexander Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although \"the powerful have been afraid to leave only one oppositional to Parliament.\"
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to voters.
“We have to deal with many problems here - the oppositional newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the way when distributing stones, but I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones -” Milinkevich said, citing that not even the most-supported layer of pensioners is in agreement with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
“Thanks to the country’s debt and the increase in trade deficit, it is only a matter of time until the ‘social security’ of a cemetery’ begins to break down,” Milinkevich said.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Community’s Independent States mission, explained to the Ria Novosti news agency: “People believe the deeds, and not the words, so the lack of opposition is a proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: “From now on, breakfast is served before work.”
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi, there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
As of today, the measure will come into force against those Schlaummeiers who first stamp off and then go to coffee drinking during working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers.
“Dreamable doors are a means to increase labour efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services,” said Brunetta Minister.
“Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism, which Brunetta once again underlines.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says, “The choice of rotatable doors is also of great symbolic value.”
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: “This process was supported by all who worked together from all sides.”
So everything in all there is now no more breakfast during work time; end with coffee or croissant.
Brunetta's advice is given with a smile: \"A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonderfully.
During a meeting of the Supreme Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
From Rome, the Minister announces that “in three months, officials’ absences have decreased to 50%, that is, 60,000 people a year are more at work.”
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration
“The pay dynamics, such as the minister, have been twice as large as the private sector in the last 8-10 years and far above the inflation rate.”
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have come together to oppose the Brunetta decree under the Codacons-supported vocation.
“While the Minister for Public Service is profiled with numbers of lower declines at work, the consumer center writes, the people of the ‘active failure’ are growing uninterrupted.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable public service officials have come together to declare war on the illegal standards of the decree.
In particular, the regional administrative court (TAR) shall apply for additional financial compensation for work-related disease; the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, while the control visits can be made and further aspects of the ministry's innovations are challenged.
Napolitano: \"Prevention against work accidents is crucial -
Every day, 2500 work accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For the year 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents were around 1200.
These figures testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will take the 58th national day for the victims of work accidents to draw attention to this dramatic situation.
“The concern-stricken data spread by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is,” the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano confirmed in his communication to the President of Amil (Associazione national mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his “great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of jobs, the protection of injured workers, the assistance for victims’ families and the awareness of public opinion.”
“An angry ‘bastah’ has raised itself up on this; understandably in the case of tragedies, which, measured by their order of magnitude, triggers some vortex in the media and participation of the public, but the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that “there is definitely also a resource problem: it needs to be invested decisively in education and information.”
A special importance is given to the numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness of the school framework on the part of the young people who feed on the working world.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to distract from its social seriousness, to put into effect and improve a legislative standard.
On the one hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber has emphasized how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which insults the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on decided rules that aim to put an end to the problem.
“The data of work accidents seems to signal a slight improvement, but this does not rule out the too high number of work-related deaths,” the president of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli, said.
“We don’t want this “positive trend” to mean less attention. That’s what causes the tragedy in the end.
“How do you think you’re basically doing too little to resist the phenomenon of accidents, and you can fight against it through various actions?
Stronger controls and inspections are, in our opinion, necessary - so Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate workers who are already in school -
\"An additional effort is necessary - so it adds - as regards communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility from the side of the employer is in relation to a phenomenon representing a social emergency.
Mercandelli also came to talk about the “advanced deterioration in the protection of the victims of work-related accidents” and called on the “disruption of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years”
“The aim is therefore to give the worker a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of a job application will not depend on voluntary or random donations that will be decided by a legislator from time to time.
Mp3 player under charge: danger of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 player, can result in permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which in a report published today in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Csseri (Csseri Scientific Committee on the Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) of the EU.
“It is clear from the report, in a note, that 5-10% of those who hear loud music with portable musical devices for at least five years a week longer than one hour a day risk the permanent loss of their hearing.”
“I am worried that such a large number of young people, who are normally portable musical devices and mobile phones, are putting on a high volume, damaging their hearing without knowing it incessantly,” said Meglena Kuneva.
\"From the scientific findings - so it says on the part of the Eu - there is a clear risk of pressing too fast action.
What really counts is to make consumers more sensitive and to make this information available.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to review the already existing control systems so that they are completely effective and keep pace with the new technology.
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people.
\"The scientists - the EU's communication - confirm that there is too much concern and that the European Commission, together with the other EU members and those concerned, is now investigating the necessary measures to protect children and young people from noise that comes from portable musical devices and similar devices.
At the moment, there is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable musical devices to 100 lb. The concern over the damage that could result from too much noise.
These damage can be greatly limited, in which solutions such as reducing volume and length of noise are used.
In its report, the European Scientific Committee points out that if the users of portable musical devices hear only five hours a week of loud music (according to 89 decibels) so that the legal limits are already exceeded, the maximum noise level at the workplace applies.
Those who exceed this limit risking the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This is therefore 5-10% of users of such devices whose number can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno gives the launch committee on the Commission for the Future of the Capital -
We are starting today, in March it will be over, in June the balance sheet will be drawn.
This is the end set by the Capitol for the work of the Commission on the Future of Rome, the Commission has met in the new seat this morning behind the Caracalla thermals.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the City and Municipal Council will review the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the “official stamp” of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
\"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it - - stressed Alemanno. \"It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political representatives remain the city and community council.
There is no new distribution of powers, only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
In March its task will be completed and the Commission will resolve again, as such a project must have a time-term endpoint.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work provided by the Commission -
Those who question the Commission’s competence, since their opinion lacks connection, Alemanno replied: “Everything depends on the work the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, she provides the Attali Commission with high quality results - and this will certainly be the case in Rome - her contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time to work seriously with a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city.
The mayor of Rome places great emphasis on the following: “This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to our attention. It will employ the best heads of the capital.
According to Alemanno, it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to jump in quality - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step into the future.
A future, said the mayor of Rome, who “will not only limit himself to the current municipal borders, but also look far further, not only with regard to the role of Rome as a metropolitan and political capital of Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.”
Obama, the first anti-American president?
A well-known American politician, who is deeply concerned about being considered independent, wrote: “Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, decimated the economy of the United States and who was dealing with enemy Islam (and still is doing so as a private man).
The attacks against Obama are getting more and more violent, right now, where the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an internet page: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very pleased: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators.
However, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the voter's question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; all say Obama will win with a great lead.
In this case too, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its Editorial: only in the electoral cabinet will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice.
This is where a United States mentality appears, which has been kept hidden until the last time.
Saying what you want, we will decide for whom we will make our jokes, whether for Obama or for McCain.
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will move out of America.
Something you never heard before - only now, where the success of the black candidate seems so secure.
In all cases, despite all this consideration, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistake did Bush make during his term of office? 89% responded: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 500,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a third in the back.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush’s weakness.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its traces with journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the \"killer\" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not really care about the information relating to consent due to the general credibility.
They don't feel as alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems are due to the newsroom’s shortcomings, i.e. the space in which the editors work to put together the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved - as the interviewed journalists - if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism today meets the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, it is even 65% for the executives.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for the journalists to imagine what direction the web is going in.
The most important publishing groups are getting to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the “killer” of the printing press.
The “economic pressure” that the journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping “they bring something good for journalism.”
The biggest rise is in American journalism today between the editor-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national-level editors are sure that their reporters share their values with them while they are only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with the “security in work.”
The executives who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
For the journalists, it is 30%.
The topic of “safe work” in the team (our editors) Anm. d. Red. is always a topic in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists are working under contract.
In a huge nation, as the United States is, with 300 million residents and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV operators and internet operators, employers offer as it is popular to them and so it will be a question of take it or leave it.
The editor-in-chief often gets very high wages, however, the editor can sometimes get only 10000 euros per month, for which there are pensions and insurance payments.
As for the holiday, the matter becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 vacations after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they give themselves, will often become “sick” over the course of the year.
It is a question of climate.
UNIPOL: RIGHT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second chamber of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate agent, who had asked to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppol for bankruptcy as part of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted into a stay in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such settlements (which the prosecutor had spoken out) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain evidence from him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion savings package of the White House: A large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the current issue of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis in the run-up extends the Republican Party, which increasingly splits into its old and moderate East Coast souls, which always favoured the state institutions and business community, and the neoconservatives that “represented in Washington” and the financial world, and, by the way, wins voters in the south and in the center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of what I mentioned above.
This just-mentioned example is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even represents: not only in the United States, also in the West and perhaps beyond, these will be affected.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-afraid events, which finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the state’s unheard Renaissance in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close connections to abroad while at the same time managing an unprecedented amount of the assets of private households that live in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for governments: how to behave against the families concerned, which is also a huge electorate.
So the crisis appears economically global, politically opposed to it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have fallen apart and lost its right to speech: the enlightening evidence for this has been given by the EU, which, due to its two-part divisions, does not know a common way in various national and international conflicts.
Therefore, everyone now expects to take the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and e.g. distribution of aid funds: since the crisis has become more serious, only the US is in the economic situation to save itself without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimation to use these: thus two non-overvaluable conditions, under certain circumstances, on which no international organization or market will be able to decrease in a similar manner.
That new emphasis, placed on the state-national element, is perfectly in line with the ever-increasing importance that is being connected to a most closely related sector in the economy: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is just now that we have been so convinced that we have long been entering a connected whole realm, into a realm of ever-different technologies, the immaterial that we have to determine at once how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can certainly be transported from one place to another in the world, but are still connected to an extremely described piece of earth - a territory.
Therefore, the one who owns such a territory is in favour of another who lives in a barren, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short shift.
Who says territory, who rules, who says politics, also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to create two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is knowledge about the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of dismantling over the existing leaderships, including those of the economy, which have been depleted as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
In addition, a deep rich and still disturbing aspect comes to mind: a loss of confidence, an impatience, an image of inevitability, a sense of distance that is all aimed at an entire class of managers of Western countries.
It seems so convincing to many of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is the majority as a stranger and heir.
The demand for leadership is, therefore, a branch but powerful movement of the dismantling of the leading class and the traditional political establishment, manifested in the unprecedented revolts of the electorate and in the immediate turn of the collective state of mind of the past: starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, to the rebellion of American MPs against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the rights in Italy plays a role here too).
One gains the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, as well as their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems, and therefore less representative value as to what is going on in the lower social layers of the West today and is still reinforced by the financial crisis and driven to overdimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would be easy to exaggerate a “rebellion of the masses.”
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not.
The Superkleber that's going up on walls.
The forces of gravity to defeat thanks to a adhesive and to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which is now almost on target.
With a adhesive applied to an area of only 2.5 sq cm, the researchers managed to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO, an American journal, has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of the adhesive can be imagined as a series of pipes arranged to a stack of Spaghetti,” Zhang Lin Wang explains at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic resins that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass teflon and grinding paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the maintenance of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time allows to remove “problemlessly from the wall,” says Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Dayton.
“This material could be used as a perishable adhesive,” Liming Dai adds.
Maybe already, but the researchers think of a less fascinating advantage, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall into the area of space travel.
For the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER type of DEVELOPMENT - also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists present a microfibre adhesive that, like hair, cleans itself from dust by moving on a surface and thereby always retains perfect liability.
Medicines: Never take fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and their vitamin richness, e.g. in summer, can cause serious health damage if taken simultaneously with certain vital medications, as they can have an extreme effect on the intake of these by the body.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packed and fresh fruit juices in combination with drug intake. During the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again struck alert: It is sufficient to remove a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs to the extent that they are practically eliminated and thus the health of the patients is at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already under suspicion to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medications such as antibiotics, anti-Asthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurologic agents, up to toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTS IN GEFAHR - The same agency of the drug, in a report two years ago, warned doctors and patients of the dangers of this mixture, and stressed the importance of drinking in conjunction with drugs such as diazepan or metadon.
ES IS NOT NON-GRAPEFRUIT - According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
The appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: “These results are usually immediately passed on to the various international manufacturers, who are free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package bill and, if there are still difficulties, do not hesitate to ask a pharmacy or doctor - the expert of the Ansa agency emphasizes.
The Nobel Prize is for Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is for American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trading patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and external policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001, attacks, during the days of Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more crucial to the history of the United States than the assassinations.
A prediction that did not receive little polemics as a response and was presented to the economist years later, but is now proven to be completely correct.
“I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals as part of Enron or Worldcom’s collapses disappeared from the public field,” Krugman said in a statement in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an “economy of great value, but also a Banalizer with a “very aggressive style that is particularly against Bush’s excessive liberalism.”
Open Office, it appears the third version of the Anti-Microsoft package
The day of the publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source Software wins as a free replacement for Microsofts Office an ever-increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in the public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself with some novelties to the public: in addition to a revised and now more spartan-designed initial menu, it is now finally achieved from the basis of guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Eight against was also read on compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates e.g. sending via email. This also includes the possibility of importing PDF files into graphics editing modules while maintaining the original appearance of the page.
In this way, “hybrids” can now be generated PDF files that extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format around the elements of a table and a text processing system.
The cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed by different users on multiple occasions, thus preventing conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor is assigned a frabe in order to ensure a better correction process.
Some companies are just about to publish a variety of OpenOffice features on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result is to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link for download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version that has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Depending on Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD home or office.
In the meantime, free of charge can be an incentive for the spread of the programme in the private budgets, so it is also in the field of business where the large throw could succeed: in the end, various public administration and schools have already been transferred to OpenOffice.
In fact, it does not even lack a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized businesses, and thus even opens business prospects.
OpenOffice is made up of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding source code program; Calc, the table program, which aims at a displacement of Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as Powerpoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of more familiar access; and last draw, a graphics module.
The goal for the year 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads - a goal that can be easily exceeded for 3 million and 600 thousand already reached.
Coal also tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
It opens up a new doping case in the context of the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is the third-classified and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The message published the daily newspaper L'Equipe on their website.
The 26-year-old coal from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver to be tested positive on Cera, the third generation’s Epo, and this was already attended by the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analysis from the blood samples Kohls is one of those conducted by the labs Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry in recent weeks.
Now, if the counter-tests confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and, according to the Associated Press, also notified the Austrians.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose to the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the dress of the best climber for himself.
THEMA DESCRIPTION: THE NEW YORK TIMES FREGES: IS ITALIA RASSISTIC?
Italy, “the former country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants, which will only be taken up with opposition.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated to the subject of racism in Italy, and from the case of the young man, Burkina Faso, Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he had ordered a pack of cookies.
The case is based on what the Times calls the \"Paradox of the North\": the northern regions are the ones in which \"most integration and opportunities of work\" exist, and yet \"the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiment and the greatest support of the Lega Nord\" is to be mentioned.
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times focuses on further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by Lega against immigration and the rapid exposure of illegal immigrants is also introduced as a sign of climate change in Italy.
“Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope for cooperation between Church and State to combat racism at a meeting on the Quirinal.
Student victims of up to 900-Euro per room high rent prices
The market for housing for students does not know any crises.
According to the latest investigation by the Sunia, the tenant trade union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
“This phenomenon has already taken very serious action, and the whole range of students are losing their right to study, as their families are unable to support them at this height — according to Sunia’s director Laura Mariani — in these cities the great demand for the students has led to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other residents.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, without rental price limits, unauthorized sub-rents.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures that lead to a revision of taxation at lower rent prices.
With a closer consideration of the investigation, it is found that in Milan a sleeping place in Brianza district is required about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in Bande Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambie, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in Vittoria.
In Florence, a dormitory averages 350/400 euros, one room is 700.
In Bologna, where students focus in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are for a sleeping place of need, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome prices in the districts around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a dormitory in a double room.
The rentals in the districts around the other universities of Rome are only a little deeper: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those in outlying districts can save money: 300 Euros for a dormitory and 450 Euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar budgets.
In Naples you will need 300-450 euros to sleep, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Polishlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a dormitory costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to outside European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent of 25-30% above the average is required by foreign students.
Looking back to the old cinema Paradiso - the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the favoured multiplexkinos.
“A city without cinema halls is a blind city, like a face without eyes.
This image of the director Giuseppe Tornators describes with effect what is currently happening in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of decommissioning cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, means in the long run death for the one-room cinema in the center. A process that not only appears irrevocable and irrevocable, but also carries the trains of a cultural crime.
Affected are mostly historical places full of memories, \"it's like losing a friend with whom one has put a piece of street full of emotions - the director of the film Nuovo Cinema Paradiso - who brought him the Oskar and the great prize of Cannes 20 years ago. It's the story of a suburb kinos and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a well-lost cinema world.
The figures provided by the Anec, the Central Trade Association, speak a significant language: in the last five years, the huge amount of 316 traditional cinemas have been closed; these drawings have mostly paid for cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main debt is multiplexkinos, because it is just these three regions where the largest number of modern cinemas have been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy is starting the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
“The business has developed in an irrational way,” said Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, “but first and foremost, the maintenance of the already existing one, as a hall in the city, is not all his customers are willing to seek multiplexkinos in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here is the lack of an estate for the foundation of the trade union: the debt burden listed by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not respect existing laws.
To obtain the sector would be between 16 and 18 million euros in the year of need -
It is interesting to see the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to the fears of the old cinema halls, has decided to protect it by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical center and in the periphery.
Among the above measures are also tax benefits for cinema operators as well as benefits to the public regarding the proximity: it will be allowed to park in the traffic-limited areas of the center and also to cheaper parking fees.
“It’s a happy initiative,” Giuseppe Tornators said, “I hope that other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
However, we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to align something against the superpower of the multiplex rooms, because in the end, the audience is more demanding today.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the Supercinema by Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to establish the \"Nuovo cinema Paradiso\", even if I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; when I go to the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to not see the dust-covered posters.
The connections between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adjust the community’s decisions to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The charges against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, arrested this morning for dealing in Mafia business are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced for dealing in criminal associations of the Mafia, at the time to a compensation rate of 10 million euros.
“Every kind of moral and legal standard is contemptible,” the lawyers wrote, “the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli funds for consulting activities.
“So it was possible for the Mafia group to enter the councils on an official way, and to determine the policies of the public administration,” he said.
The President of the Kalabrien Regional Committee, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in its region — anything but an exception to links of local administrations and organized crimes — there are places in which the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others in which such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white west -
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with whom the police of the Clan Piromalli said.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but in 1991, and even then due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been decommissioned from their community offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the Central Rights Coalition after the May 2006 election.
He shouted scandal as the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He was interested in the vice-minister Marco Minniti, whom he denied to have invented everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges, in connection with the arrest order of this morning, declared that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change in the A3 project.
From a hearing in connection with the investigation into the Dal Torrione case, the willingness has shown itself to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli - by which the public administration’s actions have been identical to the interests of this clan -
When the energy comes out of the waves, the big ones suddenly run up.
It is an unfinished source of money that covers over 70% of the planet’s surface and only now seems to understand the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable sources of energy that are now all looking for, and are also looking for occupiers, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years, and these studies have not been on the rise at random since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil broke down by 1980, the idea of sea energy was gased, but now the environmental organisations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s global energy demand could be reduced by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This corresponds to the double of the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides also come.
Giants in the Attack.
The first company that now relies on sea energy is Enersis, who signed a contract to build a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step to take.
Two years later, it is now becoming more and more companies from the traditional energy industry that rely on marine energy production.
“Chevron is investigating these technologies,” said the spokesperson of a company known to the U.S. Giant in the Wall Street Journal, and is considering the possibility of working with us.
This is about the acquisition of an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign that is not to be underestimated, e.g. when you consider that just in Alaska, oil will continue to be promoted by the U.S. and President Bush recently launched the plans for new bores.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; the details are also unknown, but observers speak of an increasing interest.
Enhancemental technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in decline, not least, as the last doubts of environmental protection sites have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a smaller dimension and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, there is a need for technologies with a far greater impact on the environment.
There are several options: Ocean Power uses a system of interconnected bojen.
The thrust of the waves, which move the bows up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The current is sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned facilities of this kind, which are only waiting for state approval. Part of the energy gained could also be used for military facilities.
On the other hand, Verdant Power is already producing energy for a department store and a parking lot with the help of underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines which feed the generator through the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long snake of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Power Recovery Research, a particular interest is worth the potential that lies in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of power.
It is precisely time energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 — up to 35 million have been planned for 2009.
