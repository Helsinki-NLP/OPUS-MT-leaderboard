Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters from each other: on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian temple at the village parking lot has been installed in Gutach, in view of the older town hall.
Two facilities so close to each other: intention or thyroid strike?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach’s mayor yesterday.
“The town hall temple was installed at the time because it secures the school path - Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser Ampel secures both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The facility officially operated yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg/Churchstraße crossroads.
We have the museum, two churches, the spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area.
“At the high traffic and pedestrian level, there had to be a further ample to their safety,” Eckert said.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landratamt Offenburg.
According to current measurements on B 33, about 12,000 vehicles per day pass through the municipality of Gutach, about ten percent of which are heavy-duty traffic, says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of a further amphitheater is more than necessary: “Survivability is just going to happen here,” Arnold said.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, and a circuit transport was also planned, but due to the plug in the Sulzbachweg/Churchstraße crossing area, it was reassigned again.
According to Arnold, in the location choice of the Ampelmasten, everything was tested before: “With an extra for us with particularly long wooden steams, we have stood out to see if these vehicles can exit from the Sulzbach Road to the B 33 without knocking around the Ampelmasten.
The around EUR 15,000 expensive amphitheater itself is the “modernest thing that is currently on the market” Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs, which shine so strongly that the lights can be seen well by the car drivers, for example, in deep sun.
The older light plants consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three light systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the ampel button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the road is free, immediately comes green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
“If a group or disabled people go over the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will be safe on the road,” Arnold said.
Of course, the driver had to think about this as a partner and watch the highway.
This was not the case yesterday: Kaum showed the ampel for pedestrians green, threw a top-class vehicle through - in light red.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth of the soul.
The disasters of his Catholic village-childhood - the speechlessness, the slope to harsh violence and stupid sexuality, the envious and joyless - have often described the butcher poet.
The Büchner Prize winner is best known as prose author, theatre lyrics are rare in his work.
Collage from prosetexts Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance “weather lights on the tip of the tongue,” which can now be seen in the garage X at Petersplatz, therefore a collage of prosetexts.
The theatre maker, for example, combines elements from the autobiographical novel “The Body’s Own” (1987) with prosaminators from “Leichnam, his family bespeaking” (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important requisit: a circled sofa, on which an indication is copulated and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overwhelms the template with a full range of direct incidents, known from the repertoire post-dramatic forms of play.
In particular, the actresses come into play with the somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are taken hard, immersed with their head under water, packed with their evening robes to the wall.
Forced into cellophane or medders, they strike on dangerously high sticks through the insurgency, either monolog them loudly or lie completely muted on the stage floor.
However, the text does not convey itself in this way.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk tune.
Only by the end does the overturning performance come to rest, and Winkler’s subsequent absurd humor flashes.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that takes place in the armature board of each car.
The devices that record every mile and report the information to the authorities are at the core of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to update the outdated system to finance U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have associated themselves with environmental groups, and speak out that the government can use the small boxes to record the miles that have been driven — and possibly even where they have been driven — and then use the information to calculate tax decisions.
The Tea Party is upset.
The U.S. Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
However, while it is impossible to take some action in Congress, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently checking how they can switch to a system over the next ten years, where drivers pay per mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of whom are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we’ll only be able to use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans a record of the driven miles for all California drivers in the state as of 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes paid by U.S. U.S. citizens at the Zapper Column, is pleading.
But in America, no more is done as much as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocents per liter) has not risen for 20 years.
At high injection prices, politicians do not dare to raise taxes just by one cent.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” says Lee Munnich, an expert in traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with drivers to test a mile-based payment system.
“This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term,” he said.
Bureaucrats refer to it as a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is found in urban liberal prosecutors, because, for example, the tax allowed itself to affect driving behavior in such a way that dust and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
California planners focus on the system in the development of strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally anchored goals for climate change.
But Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he sees the most common long-term alternative in it.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also prompted by the idea of paying drivers after a set-back route.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” explains Adrian Moore, Vice President for Policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, invited Congress to move towards mile-based billing.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented this from happening and responded to the concerns of members of rural areas who often had to leave many miles on the way to work or to the city in the day-to-day life.
Several states and major cities are not moving on their own in this direction.
Oregon is the most committed Oregon that currently hires 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministry of 17 countries on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to implement the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical in thinking that the government could track any of their movements.
“Considering Big Brother and such things was a big problem,” explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and result management in Nevada’s Department of Transport.
People didn't want it.
When the test was in progress, Nevada’s ACLU warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the drivers into advanced surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that now look forward to affordable technology that allows the state to capture the miles that have been driven, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, Khan would be more calm to the public as well.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company has not initially arrived to help state-owned traffickers.
Rather, it was their goal to take foot in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles.
But the devices tested by them are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
“People are more willing to participate if their speeds and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, managing director of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs, big mistakes were made.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment with giving drivers a number of options.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose a device at all and instead pay a rate fee based on the average miles driven by all residents of the state.
Other organizations hope to be able to sell the concept of a Belarusan public by equipping the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a control device that also allows parking fees to be paid, insurance must only be paid for driven miles and speed data collected from other vehicles in real-time, thanks to which car driver Staus can deviate.
“Car drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits that the system offers,” it says in a city’s planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder if the whole conversation about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials explained that Congress can solve the problem of bankruptcy Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-on-one fee or an annual loan could be imposed by car drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they can also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for an operation, if an aspirin is sufficient,” explains Randy Rentschler, the head of law and public affairs of the Commission.
When we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beat up watcher
The Voluntary Firefighter managed her autumn lead test despite personnel shortages with Bravour.
Only 11 men took part in the exercise.
Department commander Hans Kammerer had selected the estate Feder in Burgberger Straße in his execution appointment.
There is a short-circuit to be made during the sowing.
Two people were injured by the fire and smoke, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of the case, two breath protectors of the Wehr prepared Hans Kammerer to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead him to freedom.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as it was also a tight stairway to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also strawballs in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first deletion attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was carried out via a flood hydrogenant at about 100 meters away.
Three delete attacks could now be designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also went on to show what to do with little available staff.
In the case of serious cases, support is given to the daily use group Königsfeld.
The commander was satisfied with the execution of the exercise.
Connecting universities and companies is important
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Landtag President Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Newstadt about where the workers came from tomorrow.
At the Hochschwarzwald funding centre, he went along with the senior school executives of the vocational schools, as well as the county high school and the senior counselors of this important question.
“Training is an important location factor,” said Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Center Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed with the model projects for training.
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre, the county high school and the vocational school centre.
He also praised family kindness in the county.
“It’s important not only to have the family phase in mind, but also to have the phase to care for members’ care because of demographic change,” Wolf said.
He also indicated that more and more employees were concerned about the care and care of their members.
“Without the support of employers, the resulting burden of employees can result in an end to the working relationship,” Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose qualified workers, he said.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
“For those who have already met the region’s advantages during their studies, their acquired knowledge and skills are often received by the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region,” the country’s president was convinced.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered, the need for skilled workers could also be granted.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the county is its advantageous location in the south-west of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport.
“Stay firm and make sure public transport is getting better,” he said to the address of local politicians.
Music experience an entertaining afternoon
For the past 15 years, the Kaul family has invited the Dieting Seniors to coffee, cake and then to a Vesper.
In the past, the older citizens were treated in the restroom.
This afternoon, St. Josef's nursing home takes place.
Home residents are looking forward to the delicious cakes and torts.
Later there was Wurst Salat.
With common tunes, Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father, Karl Kimmich.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as a front-limiting of the old school courtyard to the church street before the renovation is to be re-established with the city's relief cost plan.
In the days before the Kilbig, during the first work of renovating the front school courtyard, a small angle wall was built to stabilize and static discharge of the natural stone wall with balustrade over a hundred years old.
Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the National Monument Office, is planning to include in the planning and create a renovation concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation is to be carried out by professionals who should then be put on the table to the Municipal Council for the decision and determination of the further process.
A decision on this is expected to fall in the coming year.
After the restoration, planting and planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it is necessary to take the necessary measures in due time to clean up the wall from the ground to the new under construction.
The historic one-hundred-year-old delimitation wall of the old school courtyard to the church street is mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, need for repair and has an arching tendency forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage, but the wall is currently not destroyed.
A stable wall is required for a school courtyard used by students, which is done by the current fastening work.
Originally, the school court rehabilitation was even planned in the 2008/2009, but high unplanned spending brought a shift.
An important word in the historic school wall restoration, which has even been used for film recordings, will be the National Memorial Office.
If standards come from this site, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the memorial protectors.
The students of the Bräunlinger Primary School, who are now being taught back in a well-renovated old school building with new Aula, can soon use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions about the future of the music high schools in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now joined.
“I think it’s wrong to give up the holistic training at the Stuttgart University of Music,” said Özdemir, the “Stuttgarter News”
Jazz and classics are just together at the jazz venue Stuttgart.
Thus, Özdemir, who is considered a favorite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate at the Bundestagswahl on 22 September, opposes the Green-Roten State Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this forces a new order of the five high schools of music in Baden-Württemberg.
Then, among other things, the course of study is to be attended by Jazz and Pop from the Stuttgart Music High School to the Mannheim School of Music.
U.S. Border: \"Super-Tunnel - Discovered for Drug Smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators discovered and silenced a super-tunnel for drug smuggling.
As the U.S. authorities reported, the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail glass and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were therefore arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
The tunnel has not yet been put into use.
“These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig down under the radar,” said the U.S. Attorney-General of the Southern California District, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a San Diego warehouse, where this was discovered to be an end of the tunnel.
To the drug gangs, Duffy assured: “If you continue building such tunnels and trying to use them, we are determined to make that a huge waste of your dirty money.”
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The rail system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a conductor leads 20 meters to the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters in width.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested because of the captured marijuana.
All three threatened as the highest penalty for life-long withdrawal, as officials said.
Since 2006 eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the San Diego press conference.
However, it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel building.
Usually cocaine is smuggling in smaller quantities and not by tunnel.
This showed the \"controversy\" of drug gangs, whose traditional routes have been cut down by now, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug foundation in San Diego.
They would do everything they could to get to the United States.
No details were announced among the arrested, at least one being Mexican, it was called.
You must be charged with imprisonment for up to ten years.
Geisinger
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250s.
Returning to the first initial mention is getting closer.
If the year ends in good eight weeks, the anniversary year is on.
Geisingen and church houses were first mentioned together for the first time.
In churches a certificate was made, in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there will be an official opening for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this wake-up event will take place in the place where 1250 years ago both were mentioned for the first time, in church-houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned in Geisingen, as well as in church-houses.
Church-houses will be held in July on a festival weekend from 18 to 20 July 1250.
Celebrate return.
On Friday with a feast, on Saturday and Sunday with a feast around the church hall.
At this festival weekend is also the church-house church festival.
City music director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On 21 June, together with the Sonnwendverein of the Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall.
It will be completed and inaugurated during the anniversary year, the official appointment will be on the last September weekend, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary, a new chronicle is also being brought out.
“But it is to become a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the Geisingen of today, which consists of Geisingen, church houses, leiferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen,” says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today’s Geisingen celebrates its birthday in 2014, and today’s spaceship was carried out in 1974 with the additions.
The new chronicle will then be presented at the new festival hall in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November.
2014 is another year with many jubilees.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on February 8 with a night of custom on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmony Gutmadingen will be 90 years and on March 29th has the feast banquet and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Polyhymnia Leipferdingen Music Association will be 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the Fountain of the Fountain from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a grant certificate owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The certificate was made in churches (houses) that were courtrooms at the time.
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
The reason for 2014 to celebrate this 1250 year accordingly, in addition, is the municipal reform for 40 years.
The Council takes railway facilities to the Visier
Should the railway crossing “Am Hirschen” be rebuilt in order to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the councils decided.
Schultach has to take 220 000 euros into account.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal train route in the coming year.
In particular, the safety of rail crossings is to be increased - regularly there are collisions of trains with other vehicles.
The municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they must participate with a third in the cost, the rest of them sharing train and union.
Schiltach's mayor Roland Grießhaber explained to the Council the characteristics of the Bahföhrung - Am Hirschen -
There, the city plans to build a booking at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway.
There could also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwoods, in counter traffic without having to block the glare.
Greeßhaber therefore proposed that a necessary support wall be constructed in such a way that the city could expand the afterward road at given time in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for a road spread: Thomas Kipp, in his statement, brought the critics’ mood to the point: “We need to take so much money into the hands of so few vehicles”
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The railway crossing “Hirschen” is regularly used for long-wood transports.
Even wood from the \"Kuhbach\" area is partly transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn down the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a redirect for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
In view of the fact that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg Tunnel had to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the “Hirsch” railway crossing could also have an important transport significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to investigate what costs would cause the intended spread of the road.
Regardless of this, the conversion of the railway crossing was largely agreed with the measure that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city can extend the subsequent road towards the railway station road, if necessary, to around 5.5 meters for meeting traffic.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a completely different problem involving access to the rapidly increasing \"Geroltzhaus Wegen\".
The administration had examined the construction plans of the train from the engineering office Breinlinger, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus would be possible.
The investigation found that there was no exclusion that the inclinations of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting.
The responsibility for this, in turn, bore the city as a road construction carrier.
The reconstruction can therefore result in liability disputes.
Since both the wood removal and the removal work in the current state of expansion, one does not agree to the reconstruction of the rail crossing, Haas argued.
Also at this point the risk of collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is significantly lower than the other rail crossings, because there is directly beyond the stop center to which a good visual connection exists.
Even trains from the main station had to be stopped at this point so far that no collision threatened.
Mostly, the conversion of this railway crossing was denied the consent, as the city of Schiltach had to “explode” the problem with up-to-date vehicles, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the construction work was completed.
The body considers the conversions to the railway crossings — Vor Heubach — and — Vor Kuhbach — to be made for the already cross-border agreements with the train.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravity waves, or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now start on two major projects they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were made, five are still in the race.
Far Worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already been found by astronomers.
Whether there are at least some of them, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: should you search for gravity waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the Cosmos?
Or, according to earth-like planets, could they find alien life?
These questions are now addressed to the responsible representatives of the European Space Agency Esa.
For their program Cosmic Vision, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will lead the research to decisively advance.
The rate for such “L missions” is approximately one billion euros each.
The launch will be expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
There were 30 ideas on the debate, five of which have now come into the closer choice.
Numerous bodies examined the proposals, and the researchers looked at them.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four big questions, the Esa has chosen to find answers to the missions of the 2007 program Cosmic Vision.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the creation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the spoken dark.
A large infrared telescope in all could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can life come about?
In order to address this question, 2017 will launch the space telescope “Cheops” with a more accurate analysis of 500 already known planetary systems in our nearer environment.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could imagine earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, looking for “biomarkers”: gases that are considered an index of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also to be raised in the end as to what conditions exist for the creation of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation from it with the planet system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined exemplary.
With the 'Solar Orbiter', the Esa has already accepted a M-Class mission (there is the budget of about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe will start in 2017 and observe the sun's surface and activity closely.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
The Esa provides the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision program.
The “Juice” probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) starts its journey probably in 2022.
Eight years later, she reaches Jupiter and will investigate the planet’s atmosphere as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many ways to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead the physicists to a new theory, under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come about, and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our Cosmos was created by the Urknall.
In addition to the matter we are accustomed to, from the stars, planets, and living beings as we are, there is dark matter, the force of which holds together galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy through which the expansion of the universe is accelerated.
So far, the researchers don’t know which physical laws were valid in the first seconds breakouts of the Whyknall, nor what dark matter and dark energy are.
With Euclid, the Esa has already agreed to an M mission, which is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the universe and thus enable conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
The best chances of a willingness as an L mission, many experts believe, “E-Lisa,” has a challenging concept to prove gravity waves.
This includes physical changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisha could do this, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in the All.
In contrast to plants on Earth, it could also show gravity waves that were created during the Urknall, thus providing new insights on the origin of the Cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called “Athena” which is to explore black holes, “Icy Planets” - another mission to the outer planets of the Solar System, “Prism” - a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the “Exoplanet Finder” to detect and investigate the earth-like planets.
There are proposals for sample return transport from Mars, for the research of moon, Venus and asteroids as well as solar physics.
Snowden is ready to \"cooperate with Germany in terms of US surveillance\"
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence service, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and announce before the German Bundestag when the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander give no answers to their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received this asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, he wrote: “Even if the result of my efforts has been proven positive, my government continues to treat a disparaging opinion as a breach of loyalty and tries to criminalize political expression with criminal threat, where no defense is possible.
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the U.S. government to drop the charges against him.
The charge raised by the U.S. Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Time Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make that possible.”
The relations between the United States and Germany are burdened by the allegations that the NSA has shut down the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member of the parliamentary committee responsible for the Secret Service, explained that it was, of course, the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if it was possible, \"without risking him and completely ruining relations with the United States.\"
Ströbele, a Greens MP, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to former NSA employee Snowden, he could not return to Russia if he left the country.
When Snowden speaks in Germany, he needs a guarantee that he is “safe” there, the MP said.
Snowden, in his letter, explains that he faces a “serious and ongoing” campaign of persecution that has driven him out of his home.
However, he is touched by the global response to my act of political expression.
Citizens around the world as well as high-ranking politicians, including in the United States, have called the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit in general.
In his letter, Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation, “if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved”
Frontier Airlines Raises Handbags Fees
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to $100 of passengers who want to store handbags on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $100 for a piece of handbag and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if it was read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers might keep the whole box.
The new fee applies for handbags in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that you would charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 in travelers who only paid on the flight trip.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee was aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to calculate this sum,” she explained.
Airlines began in 2008 to demand fees for the first and second piece of luggage.
Passengers who were trying to handle this have therefore put as much into the handbag as possible, resulting in the fact that the luggage compartments over the seat are often crowded.
Fees are a way to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It’s about the most loyal clients of Frontier, who have clearly expressed that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the field above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger on Frontier’s flight trip may be able to carry a luggage free of charge, but the next person has to pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and check-in procedures would change, so passengers were informed of the fee before they arrived at the flight stop.
Frontier’s new handbag fee will only be in effect in summer, a precise date is not yet available.
Passengers often scramble over luggage charges and other fees, but airlines like to take advantage of them.
They argue that transporting the luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish.
Many on Wall Street view the new luggage fees as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of flight trips after years of loss.
However, most leave the fingers of fees for handbags so far.
Spirit Airlines Inc. requested three years ago as first charges for handbags and later, Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airliner.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is careful about the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the handbag fee Spirit would bring in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who had previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with spirit and was curious about what would expect him to fly when passengers faced the unusual handbag fee of the company.
“The boarding process was among the most smooth I’ve experienced in my career in aviation,” he said.
I expected to see teeth and hand-held discussions on the flight trip.
“The plane was full,” he said, “and the boarding ran as lubricated.”
Frontier also follows spirit at the $2 that is required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and coffee for free.
Water is still free.
U.S. Airways had briefly tried to demand money for refreshment drinks in 2008, but this returned seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company was withdrawn.
Frontiers step to raise fees for the handbag if passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative with which customers should be directed to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to buy directly with them instead of via an online travel agency.
Frontier has gone the most far in this area.
In September, the company began to spend only half the number of multiple fly miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced once again to 25 percent of the flight route.
A third-party flight with Frontier over 1,000 miles therefore brings customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also apply exclusively for direct purchase on the Frontier Places website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The proceeds fell by 9 percent and the flight capacity shrinked almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as can be read in the financial report published by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., on Wednesday.
Republic has tried to get the finances of Frontier in the context of the company’s sale.
Words From the Bible
About 40 women visited the last breakfast of this year in the evangelical church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the municipal house were “speaks from the Bible - and “redempties from the Middle Ages”
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the Church Council, entered the biblical proverbs after breakfast in a talk.
“Words contain life-wiseness, regulations or warnings,” she said.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible sites and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs such as: \"Let the eyes of the wood be vigilant, as sheep fall from the eyes, cast an eye upon a man who is the Lord's, and wash his hands in innocence.\"
On several occasions, the referee also gave advice to their listeners as to what proverb it was.
In the Middle Ages, church councillor Christel Dehner assumed that all good things are three, blue, something to be hoped for.
She explained the meaning and origin of the speech that she called \"bruising in the past.\"
At the end of the day, a Tombola was released.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before being handed over to the winners.
Among the guests of the breakfast round, the mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger was also mixed.
Learning instead of unemployed: Pilot project for uneducated in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is being launched on the Mecklenburgen Seen Platte today.
Under the direction of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as teachers in the industry are to be qualified as professionals for hotels and guesthouses over three winters.
“New to that, the six-month course ends with graduations,” said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg Labour Agency.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies received trained professionals who were increasingly missing in hotels and guesthouses, and the agency did not have to finance unemployment.
The project also includes the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel and Hospital Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains that an internal error and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the website
The estimated National Security Agency declared on late Friday that an error had paralyzed their public website for several hours and not hackers as claimed online.
“NSA.gov was not available for a few hours this night, as an internal error occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an e-mail message.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the failure has been caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early hours of the evening, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours, and this is not for some users.
Previously, a NSA spokesman to ABC News had declared that the authority’s sensitive internal network was “not compromised in any way.”
Secret information is not at risk, the speaker said.
At least one group of hackers claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency (No such authority), is now exposed in the bright light of the public and looks at the revelations made in recent months about its extensive monitoring program in domestic and abroad, a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the intelligence service caused initial speculation about the incident today is the result of targeted cyper surgery.
The number of people without job in October fell slightly by 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota is 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, “we had hoped for more,” says Monika Feld-Bauer, deputy director of the agency for work in Sonthofen.
Many companies have so far responded to attitudes.
One reason for this is according to Feld-Bauer: “We rarely have professionals in the craft, in health care and in the old care.”
Since September, seasonally, jobs for staff have also been in the hotel and guest areas.
In mid-December, the winter season begins.
You will find the entire background report on this in the Allgäuer adblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33.
Winning in Bombardier after decline in delivery numbers and orders
The Canadian airline and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decline in net profit on Thursday after being pressured by reduced orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railway section.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release flight test data for his brand-new CSeries aircraft and did not provide new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
Only three more launches followed on the plane's maiden flight one and a half months ago, which makes it apparent whether the test phase runs as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a price drop of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment of \"outperform\" to \"sector performance\" on Thursday in view that the share has a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
“Two weaker delivery numbers on aircraft were widely expected, but we are very disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector,” Doerksen said in a customer’s letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the aircraft test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, then we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
However, to date, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, since potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new nozzle transport aircraft are relevant.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and assignments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, the management assured analysts and media that the program was on the schedule.
“The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected,” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference and added, during the aircraft’s lifetime, ground tests and software updates were set up.
Every manufacturer is planning differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then attach a revised period, whatever we did.
This happens during the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly after, it was called company side.
However, analysts remain skeptical as to whether 12 months after the maiden flight of the first customer can operate an aircraft of the CSeries.
Bombardier said it reviewed planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it in the next few months.
\"The slow advance of the flight test - even if they obviously match bombings of internal planning - strengthens our view that commissioning to the first quarter of 2015 is moving,\" Doerksen said.
In the third quarter with the end of September 30, Bombardiers net profit fell to $147 million and 8 cents per share of $172 million and 9 cents per share a year earlier.
The adjusted profit per share is equivalent to 9 cents.
Sales decreased slightly and decreased from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected 10 cents per share and $4.56 billion in sales, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer says he delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, a drop of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The amount of orders in the air and space saving was $32.9 billion on 30 September and was therefore excluded from 31 December.
“In the area of aviation and space, the results were within the framework of our requirements, but the low order entry and market conditions were disappointing overall,” Beaudoin said.
Sales in air and space savings fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this savings rose by almost eleven percent to $2.1 billion.
The order stock in the transport savings was $32.6 billion on September 30, and was thus slightly increased by December 31.
The profit gap in the area of transport has been affected by handling problems in some major contracts.
According to company management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier’s action rose by 8.5 percent and amounted to $4.83 Canadian dollars after it was also announced that Google’s financial board will switch Patrick Pichette to the Board of Directors.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world’s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier closest rival, reported a 10-percent decline in quarter profit on Thursday.
United States: shots at Los Angeles airport
An unknown has fired shots on Friday morning (local time) at the LAX airport.
While the airport management told Twitter about the brief news service that the gunman was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported the man was dead.
A security man was also killed.
The media also reported several injured.
U.S. President Barack Obama will be constantly informed of the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.

A traveler told the station CNN that many people had been looking for protection in panic.
Travelers had cried and children were crying.
Among the waiters there was panic, many had been hiding out of fear behind chairs.
He has heard two shots, says a traveler from Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security authority suffered a shot injury at the foot.
The scene has been “like in a movie.”

Until landings, air traffic was temporarily suspended, it was called.
However, on CNN, several pilots were also to be observed at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller U.S. airlines.
The LAX airport of Los Angeles is a United States largest airport.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer, who warned drug boss against police investigation, must go to prison
Basharat Dita, 42, provided information on subworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defense officer who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be discovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Dita, 42, provided sub-world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about their activities in drug trafficking after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The first-class lawyer, named Bash, was arrested in his home in 2011, after the police monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a dinner of the attorney's office.
The findings today revealed that Dita regularly consumed drugs of Class A after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to acquire unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police secured Heroine and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash during a series of house searches.
Dita, 42, passed information on to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Dita, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two points of prosecution.
He admitted cocaine ownership at a previous survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular contact with Dita in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Datta's house and put the drugs there with a 60 percent purity in a black golf gloves under the lawyer's garbage tone.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly phoned Dita, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs, and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was announced that Dita was a “normal product” of cocaine after having been discovered in class A in his hair, wallet and credit cards during tests.
Dita was later arrested, but objected to taking cocaine and said he had talked to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that their discussion was under the \"adult secret\"
During his arrest, Dita took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were guaranteed and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he announced that he was operating an office under both his private address and at work, and commanders would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it was announced that he had called for significant drug trafficking actors, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed of what the investigators knew about them.
“A criminal prosecutor should know better than anyone else that you are not breaking the law,” said Anne Whyte.
Dita is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender, as he has been too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but that of a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these people.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and mandant.
He countered the police investigation as far as possible so that they could continue to carry out their criminal activities.
Mr. Dita took his professional position.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Dita pointed out every misdemeanor of himself and said, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and wanted to pass information on to Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours but do it right away.”
But after hearing this, Superintendent Lee Halstead from the police in Lancashire said: “Mr. Dita has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal in the moment he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to retrieve valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public trust and confidence.
Dita has lost this confidence and is trying to shake behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Dita, which also led to three cases of condemnation for the possession of cocaine and judicial disability, which underscored our determination to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can withdraw from the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of the conspiracy against heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other drug trafficking participants were sentenced to total sentences of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Detta published an area of questions and answers about himself, stating that his dream job was to represent as attorney clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner being Mohammed Ali and chance inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the conclusion of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the song's newspaper Dunningen will frame two services with the \"German Fair\" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical “Rock my Life” that thrilled the audience this spring, the song newspaper will enrich two services with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert at the conclusion of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 at the evening fair in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 am at the service of God in St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title “Songs to Celebrate the Saint Victim of the Fair” D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost considered revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The fair is listed in the context of the services of God, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the Blösergruppe of the Music Association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Locodi at the organ.
Haslag: Skeptics softly look confident
With the elections to the Parish Council 2015, for example, fundamental changes will be made to the Haslag (SE) soul care unit.
There is only one common parish council for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslag, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach were preparing for the changes.
Because there is nothing to change about the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactory as possible.
Over the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the scepticism toward the new softly reluctant but seeing a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the newties in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officers of the soul care team.
With a presentation, Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for soul care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
After this, the SE Haslag as a church community will form a body of public law that enters the rights and obligations of the six individual churches.
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation council in which the parishioner is represented by the office.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, in which six parishes are formed on-site so-called community teams.
Your task will be to promote ecclesiastical life in the place.
When asked about the finances of the individual parish, there was a considerable need for conversation.
The renewals provide that collected balances in the parish are kept for purpose.
The obligations, on the other hand, go to the whole community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the obligation of which then meets all parishes, there was great concern.
“Even in the past, it was only invested in projects that could be handled by the individual parishes alone — relative Haslag’s parish council chairman Bruno Princebach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes, Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the soul care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
In 2006, they had made the task of “Being One, Stay Five” and had to find out that this is not so easy.
The Committees of the Haslacher Seelcare Unit then addressed the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council as well as the practical work of the community team.
The work will be done in further meetings and will be decided in a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
In the end, parish councilman Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the soul care unit, which was agreed with a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorfs have to rely on higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the Stadtwerken, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SÜDKURIER, a four-headed Pfullendorf family of 70 to 90 Euros a year will increase.
The main reason for the rise in prices is the increase in the so-called EEG envelope from 5,277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This deposit will be reassigned every October by the four operators of the major power routes.
These determine the additional costs resulting from the energy transition that they can raise by a shift over the current price.
The townships of Pfullendorf form the last member in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company, in its predictions, even went from a higher downturn, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the specific payments had to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
“We’re going out of a raise of 1 cent plus x, so Bias, where the number will be closer to 2 cents.
Ampel on permanent red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes an ampel just won’t be green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What should you do?
If a affected person has waited long enough for a red ampel and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the journal \"Motorrad\"
The waiting time, however, had to be “adjusted,” which could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to persist for at least five minutes before going out of a function disorder of the ampel.
However, those who continue to ride despite red lights must be in a clear sense that they are to blame for an accident caused by it.
Those who wait less than five minutes, may not wait long enough, warn Becker and appeal to a decision by the Supreme Court Hamm.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes of continuous red, a driver had ignored the ampel and had to be responsible for a vulnerable red light violation.
After all, the amphitheater was not defective, but it sprang back to green a little later.
A ban on driving was saved because of the particular situation - but not the fine.
The Community Council is pleased with the solid budget
Whenever it comes to the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipality bag in Herdwangen-Schönach has been well-filled and the administration has not known since 2005.
The financial year 2012 can also be seen as a full success in this sense.
This became evident in the presentation of the annual bill for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million was more than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget was also about €1.8 million above the approach.
To be thanked is the surplus above all higher commercial tax revenue and the community share in income tax.
The budget of assets was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
“This is essentially due to the higher supply from the administrative budget,” Rothmund said.
As less investment than planned has been made in the financial year 2012, the return to return has also been higher.
A total of EUR 2.1 million could now be increased to EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
“That kind of work is not simply shaken out of the sleeve,” Gerster praised the annual bill.
He and the councils were pleased with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxy, but these good numbers could soon be expensive for citizens.
Because of the good financial situation, in the past, the community was able to abstain from high lifts.
In turn, however, according to Gerster, more and more grants have been cut from the country.
There are conditions for these grants from a variety of compensation items.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain lifts.
“We need to look at the issue of lifting rates, since in the coming years, investments for which we would like to have grants will be made,” Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter has been in the choir for 60 years
At 60 years of age as a singer, Hubert Wermter's story at the men's singing club Cecilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, in which he has been solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colours of his men's singing club on stage.
Even after 60 years, singing with the now well-loved choir still makes him great fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the Committee.
For his commitment and devotion, he received several awards at the same time: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Representative on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed him, since the choir is also a church choir, a certificate of the association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince.
His singing colleagues handed him the certificate of the German Choir Association as well as a gravitated tinteller.
In addition to the honor, the 31st autumn festival was in regular trains: With the MGV Betra, the Songderkranz Salzstetten, the singing department Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmaringer had invited a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which the around 400 visitors had enjoyed.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with vocal songs such as “In the Wine Paradise” and “Lustig, Her Brothers”
Her honorary singer, Hubert Wermter, prepared them to honor another small statue - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's \"Bundeslied\"
The men's singing club Betra also sings classical choir songs such as 'Jägerwerben' by Julius Wengert, 'White, far away' by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song 'When you pass through the valley'
With his mixed choir and his group of women - the “impulsory choir” - the song-kranz Salzstetten provided the women’s quote of the festival.
The mixed choir abducted with the Neapolitan folks — Santa Lucia — and “Eviva Espana — from Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the “impulsor” — also returned to foreign languages: “Liberatio” and “Hey Jude” were part of their program.
The singer-in-chief of the Baisinger Sportverein returned to home to the Vollmaringer Musikverein with “Wash der Schwob” by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts“Bierlied.
For the children, there was a small secondary program — Oma Hanne — alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperl Theatre and read a few stories that the children were busy with lunch.
Children’s dreams become true
The Kindernalbkreis and Kindertags in the Zollernalbkreis get mail in these days.
The Black Forest bot wants to support the facilities in the realization of its construction and decoration wishes in cooperation with the Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
Join the action can include all Kindergaarden, Kindertags and Kinderkrippen from all over the customs alabastery.
If you have a construction or decoration desire for your facility, you can apply with this to the Black Forest bot.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action Kindergarten building site.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Blackwood bot, building and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selected three wishes from all submissions.
What conditions are there for participation?
The wish should be to realize with building material of a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide many fluid builders.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and is then to be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan Press Apologizes About Controversy Media Act
“We are in a frightening situation and we can ask ourselves, ‘What does Parliament think about simply removing the judicial independence tomorrow,’ was in the newspaper, which considers the bill unconstitutional.
“The law is draconian and very punishable and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, chief executive officer of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal \"will always be ahead of time, because it is an extended arm of government - and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
“I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament,” he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government took the new law, “the media effectively into a rage,” on the other hand, wrote The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya, had suffered a severe stroke, and titled the draft as “draconian”
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media drew up the anger of the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras on which to see the units sent out at the site allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping center.
Chief of Police David Kimaiyo responded by commissioning two journalists and a leading media representative, even though the commission was withdrawn after a call to the media.
According to the new law, media houses can be charged with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to take possession of the affected person if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “a single penalty can push most of the radio stations into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper considers that these measures could have a devastating effect on their description of “living blogosphere” Kenya.
If they broke the media to silence, politicians could do unpunished whatever they wanted.
“No one will ever know it,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation who calls the Kenyan media a crucial control factor in public life.
“Let’s leave politicians themselves, lead the country into bankruptcy and return us to the time of hunters and collectors,” he commented.
The Kenyan legislators have already gone through the past to the public.
In May, they agreed to reverse the shortfalls arranged by the National Rewarding Commission and re-entered their dazzling salaries of about 532,000 shillings free of charge per month - they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A Dream Becomes True to FC
At the importance of the city and the football club, the official dedication ceremony for the art terrace sport in spite of the cold weather and the rain did not interfere.
A more pleasant holiday had probably been desired last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play with it.
Thus, all those who came with no umbrella or could not hold such a one for any reason.
This went on to the musicians who framed the feast, as did some speakers.
So Nass also became the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks went to all past mayor Walter Klumpp, who was committed to the implementation of the project, to the Municipal Council, the participating companies and association members who entered.
This is especially true of Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The well-equipped pensioners moved 400 square meters of plasters for the new roads.
This remarkable honorary commitment also honored the Landtagsabteilder Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were given to the urban sports committee Hubert Bayer, the district chairman of the South-Bad Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the club’s youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn added to the original lawn spot so that he could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there was the first consideration to solve the problem, when the construction of a third place at the football club's site or at the real school at Salinesee was thought.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came up for the installation of an art terrace sport site, which was generally considered to be the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were taken two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in heritage capacity, pledged a fee of €100,000 for the construction of the site, and favored the country’s funding of € 104,000.
In October 2012, the Municipal Council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros at the total cost of EUR 560 000, the highest price.
The construction of the 68-and- 108-meter-large art terrace site took place on June 4.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used for the installation of a Dirt-Bike stretch.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of internal and judicial matters.
The responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
These include direct democracy, parliamentary confirmation and the Federal Police.
In the early afternoon, the working group wanted to continue migration and integration.
This might include the issue of dual citizenship, in which both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to end the obligation for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of traffic, which is not on the meeting order on this Friday, the SPD substantiated its No to a car-to-mouth requested by the CSU.
A vignette was a “flatrate for many and thus ecologically counterproductive”, the SPD negotiator explained to his group on the subject of traffic, Florian Pronold.
There are dangers of migration on rural roads, which are already more dangerous points.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be a first step from the point of view of Pronolds.
“There is a danger that at a later time the compensation for Germans will be cut,” he said.

Car driver seriously injured in accident
In the event of an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old Aachen truck driver has been seriously injured.
According to police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on her way to Grefrath with her car on the Kempen outside ring at 21.15 p.m.
When the left wanted to turn off on St. Toniser Straße, she overlooked the coming car of the 37-year-old.
The driving vehicle collided.
The Aachener suffered severe injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Blocking after accident at the Schanzlekreisel
The accident was followed by police, when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza on Thursday night, at 20 o’clock, was on the left track of the two-lane Reichenaustraße to the south.
Shortly before the circuit traffic at Schanzle, he noticed that he was on the left-hand side of the road towards Strophyersdorfstraße and switched to the right-hand track.
This led to the collapse of the BMW of a 23-year-old constant.
Also damaged was the VW Passage of a 19-year-old behind the BMW.
A total of 15,000 damage was caused, police reported.
The highway had to be shut down during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport offers passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In the future, it will no longer be available at the Vienna-Schwechat airport.
A large part of the speaker's throughputs thus fall away - the noise level is to be reduced so clearly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the setting of passages concerning individuals.
For example, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai have already been denied the warm-up calls.
Due to the fall of these passages - on average showing around 200 personal calls by the speakers on one day - it is expected to go more quietly at the airport in the future.
“It has also been shown in the experience that these individual passages have been observed relatively little, but at the same time all other information on change in flight or departure times are going to undergo a bit here,” Kleemann said in a conversation with the radio station.
Highlander Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake car train with tractors, there is another competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 13:30 p.m.
They have a Scottish tradition, but they are swirling in the cold court.
Teams and individual fighters meet in the disciplines of tree trunks, hoofs, and water ponds.
Four and a half meters long and 25 to 30 kilograms long.
“It’s not on the far side,” explains organizer Peter Saile.
The tribe must be thrown down at the right hand, then cross over once and then just lie down.
This is assessed with most points.
In the case of hoisting, it is due to the destination accuracy.
Out of eight meters distance is thrown onto a pflock.
Skill and strength must prove participants over 50 meters in water discharge.
Time and amount of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
From each “Clan” or team, two are allowed to participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition receive prizes.
Training can be done from 10 p.m.
Wishing is a suitable clothing, for example, the contestants can join in the Scottish Rock.
It is also allowed to swirl.
For ‘outfit’, the jury will give a few more bonus points.
You can sign up until an hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swiss Highlander Games and the tractor-pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has been said on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the band music friends are at their expense.
At 19 a.m., the biraböhmic blast music from Schömberg designs the great evening of entertainment.
The chapel plays smooth Polkas and fairy tales.
However, their repertoire also includes sensitive rollers and a satter big-band sound.
With this, the Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and black-worst baron, will be among the rounds for a while.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the Narrenzunft.
On Sunday, the Leinstetten Music Association will hold its first meeting, from 14 am, the Böffingen farm chapel is a guest, and the “Oldies” then leave the feast.
The stoppelacker party with DJ Ralf is already on Friday.
More programs will be held on Saturday and Sunday, including the Oldtimer and Slepper Meeting, exhibitions by companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Further attractions on Sunday are the corn labyrinth, the craftsman market and the sheepfold.
Especially for children, there is a striker zoo, Strohhüpfburg, tractor riding (under guidance) and tractor-surfing.
The organizers are the multi-purpose club, the ski club and the tractor friends “Zündkäpsele”
Milk and egg alternatives in the overview
Vegan diet requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant ant is, for example, a quarker set.
Next, the vegetarian Federation calls the World Vegan Day on 1 November.
On the occasion of the World Vegan Day on 1 November, the Vegetarian Federation Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant-margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt let alone replace it with soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Remarkable plant tooth replaces traditional stroke.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
Half a crushed, mature banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
50 grams of applemus or a dish of ground linen seeds plus three servings of water are also suitable for this purpose.
Lockers will be dough instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a target oven baking powder, a dining spoon of food and three dining spoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of Soyajoghurt or Seidentofu can meet this purpose.
According to Vebu, around 800 000 people are currently feeding in Germany, i.e. purely vegetable.
Sleepless in New York City
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest High School got to know the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, which was reached by foot the heart of the city, Manhattan.
Here has already been a fascinating view of the world-renowned skyline, which in the evening light is a special attraction.
Because of the time shift, students were on the legs for nearly 24 hours, but faithful to the motto “The city does not sleep” the day was decided at Times Square.
In spite of this, on the second day, the statue of freedom could be reached with a ferry and climbed on foot.
Afterwards, the financial centre went to Wall Street to commemorate September 11th.
On the third day, students from the 373-metre-high view platform of the Empire State Building were able to gain an overview of the fascinating city and enjoy the views.
After that, it went through the hectic drive of New York streets across the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, students have now arrived in their host families and experience school day-to-day at Weymouth High School.
This year, a Hubertus fair is also celebrated on the Day of the Name of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien at Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the Sage for a rather careless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn blower group of the hunters Westfalen led by Brigitte Kluth musiced on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) after old, originally French tunes.
The flowers wear riding clothing because they mainly accompany rider, horse and dog companion on drag-hunting musically.
The solemn fair will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11:30 p.m.
The newly designed storage shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One who wants to make the name for the program.
According to Lexikon, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the event of the visit of the same-named café at the store in the county town of Kleve in sight to the University of Rhein-Waal, it does not have to remain at the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, with the beautiful name, the café has exactly the goal of making a real stay not only thoughtful, but always hand-fested and resuscitable.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner life at the storage 8 gives the viewer a good feeling on Anhieb.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambiente looks like a place to feel well.
Here the team, with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner, beautifies the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
For this, there are delicious cakes or individually furnished fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years of age, have already made a name for themselves as gastronomers before the opening of the dirty café at the storage: in Kranenburg they led the “Art Lounge”
From the move to Kleve at the store, the sympathetic café lovers hope to have more audiences.
Not least by the university.
“Where we do not have a specific target group, Daniel Büttner emphasizes.
Rather, the two here want to address young students as well as seniors and all age classes between them.
Apropos Café lover.
The sympathetic couple are behind the coffee genus.
Enjoy the smelling hot brewing in the various variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino drinker.
“For that reason a baguette - that’s my thing - she betrays the NRZ.
Two events were also held in the bright cafe.
Better said one.
Because the port party took place rather outside - the cafe Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ringet night.
“Beautiful, successful, and funny,” the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also not an outspoken fan of event evenings: “You can’t do it all right now.”
And with an event, I always only address those who are interested in the special event.
This is why events will be the exception to us.
\"We want to disrupt normal operation as little as possible -
The name is: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as on the team and the beautiful environment at the store in Kleve.
The road, which is becoming more and more a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many clubs, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the Gastromeile and thus also the cafe Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks to the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Stiftungsfest to which the MGV “Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker” invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club-place of the host \"Witteborg\" in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmonious fellowship in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the appropriate festivity to perform honors.
This time, the special award-songers of the year are pleased with the writer Rolf Wagener.
“Not only have you written a lot for us, but you have also turned so many rounds for us, our warm thanks for that,” said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir samples by means of activity straw went to the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participants this year, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and the last year’s “songer of the year” Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants.
\"Fifth edition of Artur Brückner\".
A special thanks came from the Board of Directors to the team of club-winner Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again enchanted a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV “Friedrich-Wilhelm” meets with its regular choir samples every Tuesday at 19:45 p.m. in the club location.
“New song-happy voices are always welcome to us,” Schlotmann said.
UN announces new targets for poverty relief
The United Nations is now starting to develop a series of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction, announced 12 years ago.
In the lead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in predicting 'sustainable development goals' to replace the Millennium Goals running in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which is adopted by world political leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared on the evening at the summit that the time had come to \"think beyond national interests\"
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to take a process to deal with universal, sustainable development goals,” he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the framework for development after 2015.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate granted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium targets.
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four days, the handball top leaguers continue to have a good mood.
This leaves coach Tomasz Malmon no doubt at all.
All are still fully motivated in the matter.
However, I hope that we will finally win again.
“Because I don’t even know how such a victory tastes, Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the 3rd-liga reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet broken out trees, Malmon warns the show finger in advance.
Many players have been trained in the A youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be very motivated against their ex-coach.
“Then it is to be expected whether or not reinforcement is still in the first,” explains the SG coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous appearances.
Before all things in the coverage work and during the shiftover game, it was a tremendous one.
There is also a need to make the chance recovery better.
Therefore, I hope that my players will finally get their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique to agree to a rare public demonstration of peace.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Because of fear of the country’s future, she has exchanged her business clothes against a t-shirt with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese and joins the crowd in the capital’s independence square on Thursday.
For two weeks there have been nearly daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fightings since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement initially supported by White-controlled Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country will fall back into an extended conflict, but recent events have troubled foreign investors and locals.
For the rapidly growing economy, much is at stake, as the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the north-west could bring investment of over $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional high-ranking Renamos, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government troops attacked Renamo support points and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
Against AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a \"lost\" who wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government.
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying, Renamo gave up the 1992 Peace Agreement.
In contrast to the FT, he explained that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
“Our vision is to renegotiate negotiations seriously,” Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have only contributed little to the relief of the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year.
“We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who come together the heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and none is willing to make the necessary commitments.
Renamo, who is pushing for election reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the attempt of a crippled movement to generate grants and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos election success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party founded by a former Renamo member, Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza, whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year, wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up the presidential office,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has undertaken unrest-founded attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which lies a few hundred miles north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port, mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale are used to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga retorted the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted “to warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not going well,” Mazanga said.
Instability has still increased frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of media cop, an independent media company, because many people have been concerned about corruption, drag-off progress in development and a recent abduction wave.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country’s future and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
“No one interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “examples for life,” an author says.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal power has no chance of against clever tricks” and the artus legends demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are “too wild, too offensive, and too dirty in some cases to be taught at schools, which is why Crossley-Holland advocated for a “careful selection” of old-fashioned works.
“I am amazed that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that in the case of authors and teachers who were “extremely didactic,” children would “completely turn off” because in entertaining stories, the messages would be “unsatisfied.”
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them as in the background as possible.”
The perhaps greatest difference between an adult author writing for adults, and an author writing for children, is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or led to the happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be shown in a sublime manner, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob Retires in Freihof
A hundred years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob occupied his retirement residence in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years in the “Free Court” became alive.
The many viewers were thrilled by the extremely short-lived scene play.
From the arrival of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob performer Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece, which received much adrift under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a spokesperson through the ten different scenes, explained contexts, and bridged periods from youth to close retirement.
On 22 October 1913 Hansjakob comes home to his children's home, in his Freihof.
And then the scene game began, in which Alois Krafczyk once more shined in his parade role as the city's great son.
Stylingly, he performed with the two-panel and \"Schwarwälder Füchsen\" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbachenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with much applause, but also his sister Philippines welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to put herself in the role of the sister and gave her life in mymics and gestures.
Between the single play scenes, the Mühlenbach Farmer chapel played appropriately selected pieces of music and finished the performance.
In order to award the honorary citizens, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honor, who, in the presence of the then-occupied official, Hette, together with a part of the city council, made his appearance.
Their anticipation then made the three-king singers, whom Hansjakob called out: “How beautiful, there will again be youth memories of my own three-king period.
With their song “O Jesuslein,” they enjoyed the audience in the outdoor courtyard as well as the Storch’s children with their loud “Out, Out”
His criticism of the Church of State had expressed his concerns about agriculture, the consequences of industrialisation, or the effects of war.
In the garden, behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
“A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever — it was at the end of the scene game.
There were a lot of applause and many praises from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of Neckar Giants Grows
The chances of the league remaining of the sporty descending Ludwigsburger Bundesliga-Basketballers have risen.
Because there should be a wildcard procedure, then for the Neckar giants, there is now less competition.
The Hamburg Towers Basketball Project will not apply for a possible backyard.
“We will not participate in the Wildcard trial,” said ex-national player Pascal Roller, who has created the concept for a professional club in Hansestadt since 2012.
A first ossuary was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
“We didn’t deal with the Wildcard process, so long as Düsseldorf didn’t get a license,” said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Up until 23 May, ascendant Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitral court and prove its economic Bundesliga appeal.
To date, however, the Rhine countries have twice denied the license.
The Court of Arbitration is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Abendmahlskirche moves into the focus
As a contribution from the city to the 150-year-old existing of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office dedicated the last of its this year's public theme tours on Sunday, October 27, the Evening Meal Church.
After visiting the Atomkeller Museum, the Haigerlocher period was to be considered after 1850 when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
Könender’s final point is a visit to the Evening Meal Church.
There, the leaders are told the history of the building of the church and gain insight into the development of the evangelical community in a through and through Catholic area.
Not least in the church is the view of the dinner paintings created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halfitter.
It is an original faithful reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point to the other half-hourly lead is around 15 o’clock at the atomic basement museum.
There are cards at the box of the Atomic Kell Museum.
For questions and information, the tourism office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. spa business.
Representatives of the Federal General State Attorney could either ask written questions or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax Agency, calling for no more named circles that were familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified in the meantime, it said.
An exit snowden from Russia is virtually excluded.
“In this case, he loses his refugee status,” the agency quoted its source.
Because Germany was ally of the US, Snowden threatened the delivery there, it said.
Long breath makes itself paid
Six men's teams competed at the club's tennis tournament for the winning title.
In the end, the endurance of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match.
A dream weather had been given to the tennis department of the sports friends Rohrdorf for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun at the tennis game was at the front of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the schedule, with everyone playing against each one.
Played in double mode with a long set up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlicher leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta, the tournament went into the crucial phase.
The favourites of Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were similar to Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
In the event of the victory celebration, Carmen Müller was finally able to pass the hiking pool to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the target path.
The second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sammin Osmicic.
The bronze stairs reached Rainer and Bernd Maier from the team Asphaltriecher.
In late afternoon sun and coffee and cake, the successful sound of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Black Forest Free Light Museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is still in the children’s hands.
The museum traditionally welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, August 24th and 25th, as part of the summer holiday program, to a colorful children’s and family party with numerous co-mach activities and events.
“Great and small can learn different old crafts on both days,” the press release said.
Whether making soap, spinning candles, fillings or making ropes, for every age the fitting is involved.
The children are helping the local craftsmen from 11 am to 17 pm.
The museum workshop also works.
In the construction of kuckuck peppers, waterwheels or circles, young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship.
A lot of fun also promises the many old games, such as push car races or stellar runs.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the Free Light Museum offers a puzzle tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 and 14 p.m.
At one end of the day, the children have to guess what stories of the truth are true or false.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the outdoor light museum during a cruise with black forests.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens are to be found and admired on the grounds.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, which drives his Schabernack with the museum guests from 11 p.m.
It’s easy and easy to get along with Hermann Büttner.
The storyteller takes the little guests at 11:13 and 15:15 with the wonderful world of fairy tales.
In addition, the children's dance group from Gutach presents traditional dances at 11.30 p.m.
Furthermore, on both events days from 11 am to 17 pm, numerous handicrafts such as the Besenbinder, the neighbor, the spider, the weber and the baker can be seen in their traditional work on the shoulder.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the Free Light Museum expect a varied holiday program.
In a New Zealand town, Burt Muro is considered a beloved Cauz because he has taken part in a race in America with his motorcycle, construction year 1920.
In spite of a heart failure, Burt is not taken away from his dream.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he transfers by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film, there are coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Piepsen Disturbs Residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the Halde.
At the site, the company has several irons in the fire.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies on wind installations logistics.
Black skirmishes the coal in the campground in front of the pond.
Distribute or charge the coal here as required.
In each movement of the envelope devices, a shriek warning noise sounds over the terrain.
“The signals serve security and are legally required,” says Matthias Schrell, CEO of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
In the case of unfavourable wind, it is unfortunately widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city order.
He took the complaints very seriously and therefore contacted the affected person, says the 40-year-old.
In close communication with the authorities, it is now necessary to keep the warning signals quiet with technical measures.
In the future, he will also rely on open dialogue with the neighbors.
Because Matthias Schrell has a lot ahead of the location.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to its 18.5 meters of deep-rooted canvas terminal, capesize bulkcarriers can also be completed here for a long time.
“This year, we want to knock the 3-million-ton market,” Schrell said.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to power plants in the interior.
If the GDF Suez power plant goes to the network, about 5 million tons of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three ship loaders on the bridge as well as the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketballer despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not narrow the huge optimism of FC Bayern Munich’s basketballers.
“No one can forbid us from winning against the best team of Europe in the past two years,” balanced Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at the title defender Olympiakos Pireus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
In their third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the crucial stages.
The guests first created the piece of art to turn a 15-point back stand 13 minutes before it was finally turned into a lead before Piraeus gave the game a turn again.
“We’ve been fighting back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague Championship, but then made a slight mistake again,” said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful warriors of the Munichers who had celebrated significant victories in the first two matches against Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and Polish title winner Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling the crowd of direct jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays Innovation has been supported, as recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters this year.
“Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were too well-known to appear in a club,” Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year’s event there are performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as by “Stand Up for Heroes” an annual music and comedy benefit event for Army veterans at Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians who participated in the festival this year have become known for rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-sluggish fantasy football series “The League” on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation at both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On”.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racially focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a television show entitled “Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg” at TV Land.
The meeting will be held at the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me when he's here, he sometimes goes through the street between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose my whole money, I might live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran shows itself a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN authorities and Germany satisfied with the process of negotiations.
“After years you now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to eliminate the differences of the last few years,” Foreign Minister Mohammed Djawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way, but the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides will come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boy Killing Game Camrades with Machete
Two children have committed the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14- and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go hunting with them.
With machetes and knives, they armed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the corpse into a well, reported the newspaper “El País” on Thursday.
They would have played football before their apartments in a working quarter.
The Leichnam was found on the following night in the town of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the disciple they had taken should have said that they had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl in front of the police described the tattoo without mention of an attack against her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elderly, among other things, called a rivalry in football.
He was temporarily transferred to a psychiatric youth institution.
Insurers must go to prison.
Due to exploitive human trafficking, supplementation, threat, insulting and dangerous bodily injury, the County Court of Constance sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Federal Armed Forces, who worked as a doorkeeper in Afghanistan after two operations, filed a stand within the framework of a trial agreement.
After that, in five cases he met women via internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the strike after a few weeks against their will.
He was fighting to break with violence and threats.
The income of women who acquired for him for some years was kept.
By confiscation of mobile phones and SIM cards, he undermines contacts of women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who handed over the women, he brought them to various brothels in the south-west.
There, he was able to monitor them in part to control their revenue.
At first, the defendant claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died alongside him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the mental restriction and thus about a limited sense of guilt, the 33-year-old laid down a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to report any of the injured women.
According to a crypto official, at least four additional cases of exploitation of human trafficking could be determined after a first display by telephone surveillance measures.
The conversations heard were marked by high aggression.
In later cases, the injured had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered blue spots throughout the body, has not made a statement to this day.
It is about “a completely broken personality” that violence and exploitation in this meteor are considered normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
“He has dissolved himself from these circles and wants to lead a very normal life after the arrest,” he said.
Oil price continues up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price also continued to fall on Friday, after concerns over a high supply overshadowed a report that grew into China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The type of oil for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in Europe in the electronic trade at the New York Mercantile Exchange in the late morning.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price decline of 5.8 percent in October.
The large crude oil supply has burdened prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy declared on Wednesday that the U.S. supply has increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer rose by 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday there was evidence of stronger demand by two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery of China’s economy, with growth rising to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Raw oil from the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to 108.58 USD per barrel.
Court blocks decision on NYPD's Stop-and-Frick Directive
On Thursday, a federal court in the United States blocked the arrangement of a judge who had requested changes to the Stop-and-Frisk program (“Instruction and Browse”) of the New York Police Department, and decommissioned the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeal declared that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be delayed until a vocation of the city was decided.
The judge had judged in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way the programme for the arrest and questioning of persons will be implemented.
The city filed a call against its assessment and the measures to be taken, including the decision to set up a surveillance body that would support the police in amending their Directive and the corresponding training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments about the required suspension.
The appeal report explained that the judge had to be dismissed from the case as it violated the code of conduct for U.S. judges by determining that a judge should avoid the seeming partiality; this was partly based on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had judged that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because in inappropriate manner they targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of substantial changes, including reforms in policies, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot program with cameras carried on the body in quarters where most of the controls were carried out.
In August, the City of New York declared ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after a police check.
An oral negotiations to call the city is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactics were criticized by a number of civil rights fighters.
Controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls during the term of party-free mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of which were black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, belonging to all minorities, filed a complaint that developed into a collective complaint.
Proponents of changes to NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police and influence the way other police leaders implement the regulation.
Opposers believe the changes would dump police's morality, but not crime; nor would money waste and the broader problem of a police solution, which is under pressure after the fall of thousands of places in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that they did not end the stop-and-frisk practices, which were constitutional, but only reform the way of implementation of the controls by the NYPD.
The Happiness of the Dreaming Camel
Luck is an oasis that only dreaming camels can achieve
With this wisdom of Bedouin, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascinatingness of the club’s “Helping Hands”
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already have significant successes.
The first chairman, Henne, reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauretania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the talks, pictures of the bets were shown on a large canvas, so guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the actions mentioned.
The Association's desert vehicle was also shown.
This is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had suggested that this vehicle be equipped with a photovoltaic plant and now plans to operate at the association in consulting function, according to Henne.
In 2008, the Kimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a poverty district on the outskirts of the capital, during the record time of just one week.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be rationalized in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a physician, henne, for example, acceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, one could not take as many trips as planned, but for this, many physicians came to Germany to hospital in different areas.
In addition, containers are regularly sent to Africa with material, such as medical devices, medicines, association materials, hospital beds and glasses this year.
The co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colorite by telling of Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile goat count from Mauritania and drawing the experiences of the Stammheimer musicians, who traditionally support the association, during their Mauretania journey.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of accounting as a young MP.
When it became clear how much money was lost, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel emphasized that global economy also wanted global human love.
It will not be forgotten, however, that Africa is closer than some think.
Gran Canaria is not far from Africa.
Coulson set up phone hacking for checking a tip
Former News of the Word publisher Andy Coulson allegedly set up “phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm a false tip on an affair of the then-in-minister Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC declared to the court in Old Bailey, News of the World in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive special advisor” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails, and pursued them, but Coulson also called on them and left messages as the court learned.
“In the opinion of the prosecutor, Coulson, who is now the publisher of the NotW, is no one who stands in front of people’s apartment and hopes to tap them on fresh ground, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction,” Edis said.
He said that NotW used three methods to research stories investigatively: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it cannot be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking notice?
He disagrees with this, but we say, “And whether he knew it,”
Rumors about an disabled Clarkes were first caught up by the NotW feature editorial when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: “Don’t waste your time, she’s with Charles.”
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was guaranteed in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective’s computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as “projects”.
During the time when the research ran, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls, in which they were asked for information about them, Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: “I have a story we want to bring out tomorrow that I would like to talk to Charles about.”
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The defendants heard on Thursday that Coulson had faced Blunkett because of an affair with a married woman when he himself was lied to the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argued to have sworn with others to hack phone calls between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have added the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned empire tax, the French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A close-up meeting ends without results.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and professional football in France managed to maneuver themselves into a bag of gas after a failed strike.
Although President François Hollande received association and association representatives on Thursday in the Paris-based Élysée-Palast, he also heard their complaints.
However, he refused to release the football from the planned 75-percent expenditure on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are expected to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will also be continued, the Chief Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, said.
The days set between 29 November and 2 December in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 thus fall out.
Things: No absolute protection possible
“We want to integrate residents into planning early,” Mayor Jen’s Hausler opened the civil information event on the high-water protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the measures planned, ask questions, express concerns and bring in ideas.
Hausler made it clear: “The final decisions fell to the members of the municipal council.
The flood that Gechingen met unprepared on May 15, 2009, had been a cutting-edge event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, according to Hüßler.
A river area investigation was commissioned with the nearby community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
“The protection of as many land as possible is the goal,” he said.
The planning of the protection from a flood of water expected according to German weather service is determined statistically every 100 years.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 percent supplement.
This is referred to as “HQ 100a climate” in specialist circles.
The water masses, which had caused significant damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
“There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement,” he said.
In order to achieve protection HQ 100a climate change, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the community being able to expect national grants of around 70 percent.
However, housekeepers pointed out that there is only one way to promote it when an overall concept is implemented.
The Community is dependent on the participation of citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case, 2016 can be started with implementation.
Among other things, the protection concept already presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides local measures in the flow of the river Irm from the Stammheimer Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, participants took advantage of the opportunity to bring their concerns in.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and backyards were planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, a specialist planner of the commissioned Forest Engineering Office and Corbe from Hillsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized the need for the interaction of all the proposed measures in order to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, it is held to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
Unfortunately, in the case of the residents of the old town, who, even in normal thunderstorms, have to suffer from an overburdening of the channel network.
The problem is known to the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, in the House, it was pointed out that the guidelines for canal systems were different than for flood protection and this could not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three-year-old rain events could be raped.
The wastewater channels would be larger to dimension, millions would disappear.
Seriously injured after collapse
On the early Friday afternoon, two motorists were seriously injured on the 44th Street near Revensdorf in frontal collision.
Police stopped the road immediately, but could say little at first.
However, there are several testimony statements that should be evaluated first.
It is clear that the 19-year-old Lenkerin of a VW Golf headed towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came against her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles bragged together, with the woman being so heavily clamped that the firearm took almost half an hour to free them from the vehicle wreckage.
The actual cause of the accident remained unclear at first.
Both accidents came in nearby hospitals.
The route remained fully closed for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostoyevski of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a divine seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Amazing the relationship in the outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski with his massive oeuvre is to be understood as the founder and apologet of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is to be read as an American prophet, who is very much considered in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in the Heyne Verlag, which sells Haffmans cassette with the 118 narratives of two thousand.
Dick explains America - the realm of stunning technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security alert and faith, to be selected.
Dick had experiences of God, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, and drugs had added to his brain.
He's capped, early on, that the computers are Divinities.
He wrote a computer’s theology and asked what makes a person different from a machine, the creator from his creature.
This is the “blade Runner” problem.
Killing.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The Minority Report comes from 1956, it flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
Here, the principle of pre-crime, pre-crime, is developed here, that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which resembles ours, Mutants look into the future - and the police are attacking.
“We capture individuals who have not violated any law,” says the Chief of Authority.
\"We're taking them even before they can commit a crime of violence.\"
And: “In our society there are no serious criminals, for this we have a penitentiary full of pesud overbreakers - you read time streams.
They assume that slamms are happening, and prevent the criminal thought from being implemented into the fact.
Dick's narrative acts like the Bluepause for the anti-terror laws and the restorative noise of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and philosophy works.
But Dick's story is not over yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no longer a division of violence, the military controls the everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor will be monitored himself and transferred to a future crime.
The system runs through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It creates its own conditions.
Not only do mistakes and sacrifices take place, but they build on it.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Philip K. Dick says, “I always want to come closer to the truth.”
Pronounce Spehafären um Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements about Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel in his Russian asylum case.
Representatives of the German federal prosecutor could either ask written questions or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, the agency reported.
Formerly, the Green Day commander Hans-Christian Ströbele had met as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
NSA disclosures strengthen corporate paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
At the direction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism (BVT), the German Interior Service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of speech between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, again insisted in September that the U.S. did not use foreign espionage opportunities to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or profits.
However, since Edward Snowden, the former employee who started publishing his full horn on U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure if they can speak to the director.
Reports from which the U.S. National Security Agency spyed out the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquired data from U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, the companies have brought paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The barrel to overrun brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been lost, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can get into the vision, then company management is certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between U.S. secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is unthinkable that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Green, president of BITM, representing small and medium-sized IT firms in Germany.
German companies believe that the United States now represents a nearly as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, a survey published by EY’s advisory firm in July.
However, in the documents passed by Snowden, there has so far been no evidence that the U.S. has passed over the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical.
In the Bundestag, it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly...
“This doesn’t work,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you wouldn’t have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything up to the IT industry.
However, the range and technical refinery of the U.S. spy agencies discovered by the Snowden revelations shocked companies who had previously seen the biggest espionage risk in China.
Cloud computing is a big change because European corporate leaders are more aware that data stored in the U.S. are subject to local jurisdiction and are potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade institution, according to the U.S. data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of the non-U.S.-based members plan to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, SAP’s deputy manager, says: “We see a new question from customers who didn’t exist a year ago: Where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that these will remain physically in this courtroom?”
Many German business leaders point out that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at any price.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is not a surprise.
That's always been the case.
“It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
Americans spy on us at a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The company’s management does not usually boast about the counter-actions that have been taken, because the attackr’s benefits have been granted.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick at a fair or the unguarded lieout of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at Automanufacturer Audi, says it has been a standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as a hearing aid.
The German BVT advises leaders to use simple prepaid phones when traveling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is the concern that small and medium-sized companies will remain accessible to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niche.
“Little and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” the BVT warns in a report.
The U.S. warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February, the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate, Russia and Israel were ranked two of the countries that served to purchase economic data from the hacking.
A board member of a German blue chip company agreed when it came to economic espionage, then - the French are the worst -
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Interior Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The secret services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, are spying out their allies.”
Hechingen: Trade fair answers to wedding questions
“Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can take,” said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding celebration is successful, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has continued.
This starts with wedding dresses.
White is must, best served or in cream.
In front are the many noises and the clothes provided with stickers are closed, often with a veil, back, and back, and often end in a loop.
However, the ghosts separate, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Kückermüller.
In the case of men, the suit dominates with western and plastic, but cream-colored or brown combinations can also be selected.
The choice of the location is important, has been explained.
Jewelryless side rooms are not optimal, the furniture should be special.
Here, the domains drew attention to their own offer in the Remise.
Anyone who wants to go ahead with the Kutsche, for whom Uwe Link has an offer.
\"Cuts are also popular for boys' children's semblances - he says.
Romantics is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion, the 'after-wedding photo' - i.e. recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothing, Elizabeth Keidel explained.
Many other details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Do not forget the proper cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable feast.
Dog Friends Successfully
For the time being, the athletes of dog friends Bitz were successful at a rally-obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his female Sandy, he scored 94 points in the Starter class and secured the fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley, he placed it 12th with 87 points.
Susi Höppen, with her Woody in Class 1, set out the critical views of the performance judge.
The parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled-up ringer mat in the high school's turnhall, are convinced that her son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in an upright mat standing behind the tribune in the school tournament hall.
Lowndes County’s investigation officials concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old’s family was in doubt.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, Kenneth’s lawyer and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They had never believed he had died as the Sheriff had followed.
“They believe that every logic is in violation of the laws of physics as well as of the common sense,” Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be confused to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Your son went to school learning and returned to the body bag,” he commented.
U.S. prosecutor Michael Moore said Thursday there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was explained by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I represent the view that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from the consequences of a “position-related upset.”
A second autopsy, however, has a different cause of death, says Moore.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil law investigation into Johnson's death, he will appoint the FBI to carry out the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff’s authority was not immediately ready for a comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in South Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities must release all surveillance videos that the investigators have reviewed.
The teen’s parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained clues about how he died.
CDC releases allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines on the treatment of food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children with food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States now has food allergies.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that should raise awareness of food allergies in the classroom and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine stock - the auto injection of the brand EpiPen is most commonly used - in order to encounter a potentially fatal hypersensitive reaction.
The legislators in the States have recently amended the rules to make schools Epinephrin easier to keep.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that are mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressing on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it,” or “My tongue cripples.”
Parents of intersexual children can choose “Sex indecently”
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third sex for children born with undisclosed genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned to male or female star.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to explain sex to such children, but can indicate \"indeed, or \"not set\" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make over-fast decisions regarding operations for a sex assignment in newborns, and to fight discrimination from intersexual people.
An intersexual person said, according to BBC years later, “I’m not a man or a woman.”
I remain the flickwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children every year are not born as a boy or as a girl.
They are among the intersexuals, a group that fall under the diagnosis of “sexual differentiation disorder” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical cardiovascular, germ drugs (Eery or Hoden) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. recommend using the best available information on gender allocation, if a determination is not possible, and do not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before, if at all, deciding for an operation.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who has specialized in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law \"claws after a good thing\"
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical surgery, but for most children this does not apply,” he said.
You can do a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for how identity develops.
The scientific data about how a child develops his gender identity is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It’s like the secret, which is why people are gay.
In a 2011 report to the European Commission, it states that intersexuals are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender individuals, because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were shown in inferior sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, reduced sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in cardiovascular structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination that is facing intersexual and transgender individuals in professional life as well as on the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Non-compliant with the gender picture, boys now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or third sex on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first sex-free person after a court granted the lifelong preservation of a sex status.
In addition to M and W, German IDs have a third assignment, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs of the strict Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “sexual theory” from schoolbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also voiced itself against German law, reasoning: \"If the world is divided into a new state where sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we're going to twist two more pillars of civilization.\"
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that they found it better when babies are assigned a sex at birth.
“The parent being is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the sex of your own child,” she said to the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born to both male and female relatives were referred to as hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God who had both gender.
Ten years ago, medicine considered sex to be something that one can remove and then rebuild.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are doubted after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex assigned to them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a “psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, it was not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The ruling theory of treating children with undisclosed genitals goes back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who believed the gender to be formable.
He characterized the term “sexual identity” and argued, social and environmentally-related touches — such as the parents raising a child — interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped whether a person considered himself male or female.
But in a case known as “John/Joan” in 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from the child during a mock circumcision, to cast out the child and remove his testament and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but he wasn’t,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he began suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the entry of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations came to the public, which are “not happy with the result.”
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male microscope, but has two significant genitals.
The doctors were not aware of whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never lead a “satisfied life” as a man.
So his external organ and the testes were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical acts.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth, and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD, through which his body was unable to produce enough testosterone to develop genitals.
After learning the truth, he moved back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
Through the operation, it has become infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project to ensure that intersexual people are perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of California-based Law Group Advocates for Informed Choice, ensures that German law can encourage stamping and stigmatization.
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to assign a “not set” to the child,” she said.
We fear the favorable intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still do not know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because “it allows adults to recognize it as a third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex,” she said.
The German law is about the assignment of birth.
This is not a fight to which small children should be forced at this time.
When they are grown up, they can decide on their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law \"powerful\" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male microscope, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Due to the receptor defect of target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
It has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the Children's Psychiatry.
Although barren, she hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a leash.
“The law gives parents room, so they don’t have to make over-destroy decisions,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to make different tests and clarify things and give them time to write before they write, either “male or female.”
In this way, everything is all right - you pull the child big and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness.
And you don’t have to rush an operation that can no longer be reversed.
“This includes the children in the decision with and eliminates the fear that the parents are driving because they think they would not do the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child decides on the sex that is better suited to him - and that's wonderful.
This will enable children to make their own decision.
Unknown injured girls by shots from car
Unknown ones have injured a 12-year-old in Sachsen-Anhalt in shots from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired a group of children on Thursday night in Genthin with an air pressure weapon.
Police told this in Burg.
The girl was easily injured on the left wall.
Rescue forces took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed to a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broken down.
Then they drove it.
The criminal police determined it on Friday.
Until now, police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called only twice to egg-throwing children who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the ovaries the same way, there should be no damage to the property.
In addition, some Sylvester bowls were burned in the urban area, but no damage occurred here either.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his cars had been packed with clad paper and his bike blinds had been removed.
Until the police came in, however, the man found all of his bike blinds in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to continue to operate.
Living with a future perspective
Waltraud Ries actually lives dreamlessly.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with plenty of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes of public transport.
“You hopefully have no fear of spiders,” Waltraud asks Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not spider phobia, but the concern of not being able to cope with the many steps to the house and apartment in old age, she explains.
In addition, since a Meniscus operation, the mid-fifties have had to experience on their own body what it means to move from floor to floor with Handicap.
Recently, a book of her appeared on the subject of 'happily living in old age - which form of living is the best for me?'
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on in old age', she begins to tell.
When she moved into the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago with her husband, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, with the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she’s among the few people who are dealing with the topic of ‘in-age’.
Most put it down as long as it goes.
“It’s always going to be the other one,” she says grinningly.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you think.
“It can be too late,” said Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for a self-determined living in old age.
'What form of living you choose, however, is always an individual decision', she explains.
D i e solution does not exist for age.
Even those who can afford a retirement seat in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that they can get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the language of the country, one also unites in the Dolce Vita,' the textbook author offers to consider dispensing volunteers.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative housing forms or the often cited pensioner WG.
In the old age, everyone has their ticks and Macken.
\"For me such a living community would be nothing,\" she says with an eyebrow.
Not even like in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen.
'At old age, you just need your retreat rooms,' said Ries.
However, that a senior community can still work, the author does not want to exclude it.
But that would have to be different from the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest,” she says.
In this opinion, at least in the capital of the country, it is not alone.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for as long as it goes,' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of civil service life at the age of the country capital.
Your service advises people around the topic of 'getting older'.
That is why older people would often also take comfort and restrictions into account in order to stay in their usual surroundings, which is also the experience of the Goods Test Foundation.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries advises all those who are involved in the old-fashioned reconstruction of their home or apartment to inform themselves thoroughly first and not to hire the best craftsman.
Today, there is also for age-oriented reconstruction specialists.
Even in the rental apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat elevation, the interior architect clears up.
But not always can the existing apartment be transformed old-fashioned and therefore barrier-free, even though it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although a stairs lift could be installed inside the apartment, which would be much larger than that with stairs fitted up to the apartment door.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, it greets her more than before the spider at her apartment door.
The United States wants Snowden to continue to pursue criminal law
The United States has not changed its attitude toward former U.S. intelligence employee Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of having given unscrupulous secret information.
As a result, he had to file a criminal trial in the United States, said U.S. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki in Washington.
Snowden’s recent statements would not change that either.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the United States not to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that the issue is of rules of a parliamentarian rather than of a member of the government of Germany.
Edward Snowden is in principle ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clearly.
This made clear to the former NSA employee in a non-responsive letter, published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and passed on to federal, federal and federal prosecutor.
According to one translation spread by Ströbele, the following word is used:
To the Admissions
I was asked to write you about your investigation for mass surveillance.
I was named Edward Joseph Snowden and was formerly contractually or directly employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I became a witness to systematic law violations of my government, which caused me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a severe and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy limited asylum, which the Russian Federation grants me in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance on my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world as well as high officials, including the United States, have considered the revelations to be a system of comprehensive surveillance that no one is responsible for as a public service.
These espionage revelations drew up many proposals on new laws and guidelines aimed at formally covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming more and more clear; at the same time, the risks taken in purchase have been significantly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts proved to be positive, my government still treats dissensions as a breach of loyalty and strives to criminalize political opinion and put it under charge.
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will lay down this temporary stance.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are met, I will be able to participate in the responsible clarification of the matters relating to the statements made by the media, in particular in terms of the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and legally.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and thank you for their efforts to safeguard the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden witness by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
“The building is in good hands,” says Winterlingen’s mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street has sold the municipality to a private person.
In its recent meeting, the Municipal Council did not agree to the sale in the public sector.
The building changed its owner at a “adjusted” price.
\"The community is satisfied - highlights Maier.
The budget was €100,000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that winterers have handed over the responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and therefore no longer have to come up for the house's entertainment, such as heating, looking at the garden and cleaning the walkway.
\"This effort is now gone - Maier is pleased.
Place concert at high-summer temperatures
The Hammereisbach Music Association gives a square concert on the terrace of the Hammer Guest House.
When conductor Bianca Willmann raised the clock stock at 19.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners were pleased with the sounds of Hammrich musicians.
President Manuela Honeck explains the music.
Honeck thanked all those who helped successfully cope with the first music hook.
Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign, \"Double Down: Game Change 2012 -
The Times presented a copy of the upcoming book and it reported on Thursday evening that the president’s top advisers had carried out “extreme group meetings and polls at the end of 2011” to find out if Obama’s disappearing hope of re-election seemed better when he dropped bids.
According to Jonathan Martin, a national correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading staff members of the campaign and the White House, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect it has on survey values to exchange former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers, including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and former White House executive adviser David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew about the proposed change.
In Double Down, Daley is claimed to have been at the top of his efforts to exchange Biden despite her “enough personal relationship” before finally deciding against such a chess move, after the data showed that Clinton’s “candidacy would not significantly improve Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I expressed a whole series of things you should consider, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
It must be remembered that the president had terrible survey values at the time, so we thought: “For God’s will, what do we do.”
While Daley referred to the investigation as “offensive care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that during the campaign for re-election, significant effort was made to find out if such a train paid off with regard to the ballots.
“In campaigns, not as much money is spent on polls and focus groups if you don’t think seriously about something,” Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley explained that he did not believe that the president of the possible change was “conscious,” the former chief of staff admitted that it was possible that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probes had reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama knew nothing about whether to let bids fall in the elections.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
What's going on with my email?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
When designing the Internet service, was e-mail similar to the traditional post technically implemented the letter secret?
The concept of early internet services was at the forefront of making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not focus on creating a stable foundation for a letter exchange.
Therefore, a conventional email corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If the user sends an email to Benni, are the computers of the two directly connected?
Anna’s e-mail program or browser sends the e-mail to their service provider in the first step.
For example, if you have a GMail account, Google would be.
This email server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content at his provider.
Will traditional emails be read through the network on their way?
Most emails are read on the way several times by software robots.
When providing the sender, it is usually checked whether the mail conducts a damage program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the provider will check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted away into a spam order.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can view corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people read the emails with them?
The probability that unauthorized people will read a mail is extremely low.
In theory, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to receive or receive e-mails.
This includes possible illegal expropriation actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to veil the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the email market in Germany?
In the mainly privately used postal fields, Yahoo and Google, according to an August 2013 investigation by Convios Consulting, only play a subordinate role.
While the shares of Yahoo mail had last fallen, GMail was able to make Google clear.
Mother in the forest sharpened and pensioned
When his benevolent mother died, a man from Wolfsburg kicked a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to cash their pensions and nursing money.
In order to continue to be able to cash pensions and care, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after police investigation into the forest.
At first, he confused the death of the 89-year-olds, and then he spent more than a year and a half with the money.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a spokesperson said on Friday.
The man then hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At the time, it was revealed that no medication was needed for the nursing mother.
The investigator told the pensioner that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this was strange to the officials, they continued to determine.
It turned out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old eventually died of his mother's death.
According to police, there was no evidence of a capital crime.
Do you like ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice-lighting ice in the dark, with the help of quallies.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a shining leak from them.
The idea came to him after he had read a research on ailments and convinced Chinese scientists to artificially produce the shining protein.
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue, thus raising the pH in the protein and triggering the lighting.
Chris explains that the food ice reacts to the heat in the mouth and light - the more you shine, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, says: \"The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.\"
The protein used in ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, pH increases and ice light up.
We tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the pollutant is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball cost me about 140 pounds.
But for this, it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation will be even more ambitious.
He says, “I like to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is impossible on and for itself due to the light burst caused by the ice crystals from which ice cream is made; but I suspect we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a quail that are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball association league after six days.
For the team of Ingo Ehlers, it is now expected that tomorrow it will be the Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season starts new for us.
“I hope that we finally have our heads free,” Ehler’s behavior is optimistic.
Finally, with the exception of the permanently-lost Henry Blohme, he has finally made his entire framework available.
And so does Daverden, like we do at the pace game.
Therefore, we need to keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, it is necessary to increase in coverage, which has left everything but a safe impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz gets more relaxed after the first season win against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that’s why we haven’t been the favorite for a long time, because everything can always happen in the Derby.
At the same time, Panitz wants to search in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
For this purpose, the A-Youth Joost Windßüß, who is active with double-game law at the A-Youth National League HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was a child, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I have become a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years I have not been willing to distribute sweets from my apartment, and will probably not do it this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep, as far as Halloween is concerned.
The majority of Americans — 158 million to be exact — celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the US trade union of retailers (NRF).
One thing that I look forward to every Halloween is the trend.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the US$6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, excitingly uninvited objects are the last cry.
Women no longer need to cover themselves in sexy clothing, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the daft punk spacers will create it into Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of hot dogs.
As for sweets, we are not immeasurable.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate gels, luts, bonnets and rubber beaks.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, who, with the speech “Such or Saures,” pull through the neighborhood.
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and, we don’t want to eat anything.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is sugar candy Corn; however, 15 million kilograms of it are sold for Halloween, according to the National Association of Sugar Manufacturers.
These are about nine billion corn grains.
It's a puzzle I haven't been able to solve yet.
There is nothing more to Halloween than homes in which it spat.
They have great names such as “Terror Behind the Walls” (which, by the way, is in a real prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized spukhouses in the United States, which earn $500 million, according to America Haunts, and this includes the wonderful photos on which you just pink into the pants and then put the friends on Facebook, where you don’t get rid of them again, and one of the type you’re on, leave a comment like “non-face expression”
But let's finally get to the bars.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Curbs when we were children, and cutting a curbush is like adornment of the Christmas tree - something we made from small.
Fortunately, the “Baby in the Kurbis” was only beginning last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting the Kurbis and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on baskets, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The crustaceans, which are slowly rotting in the front garden, are probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of crustaceans were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut something high from their 921 kilos of heavy cube.
Home Fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue Forces Mountains Refrigerated Body
The firefighter had to get out in Helmetts on late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire on the night of Friday.
The rescue forces store a cooled body out of the house.
Rescue forces have found a cooled body in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it’s a resident is still unclear, as a spokesperson for the police in Bayreuth said.
On late Thursday evening it burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the firefighter came in, the flames already struck out of a window.
The forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesperson said.
The building is no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest National Church has launched an offensive to advertise for the pastor's profession.
The evangelical-lutherian Landeskirche Hannover calculates that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors and pastors will be halved by 2030.
For young people of today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and day-to-day process itself.
With Burfien, the National Church has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full position to inspire young people for theology study.
At present, less and less young people choose to study theology after graduating.
Burfien brings this back to the process of disenchanting: “God’s voice is silent, the world is loud.
In this case, the profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am Lord of my calendar and can put my focus there where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to humans as soul-careers.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well of it.
Certainly, more will be paid in the free economy, but for this, theologians have a secure employer.
This is true of the young people of today who are not only about career but also about meaningful work.
According to the National Church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retired each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariat.
In thinly populated areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it can become difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien, among other things, wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology study offers a broad education.
You can even become a federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior you will find race seats and six-point belts as well as a free speech system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with the care of bowler-works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed -
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for tension and adventure as well as a reachable way to world-class events.
We are delighted to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the Strapazen and reality of Rally Raid.
We really had fun developing the Defender Challenge-Wages - this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, in the Defender Challenge, there is a training and test day in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters called for the rescue of a female who was trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock front in a stone break
Cockerpaniel-Hündin Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the stonebreak in her miserable location
Firefighters sailed off the rock wall and rescued the dog from safe death
The firefighter managed to secure a female who was trapped in a rock wall on a 15-foot-high protrusion.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby ran away on Sunday afternoon after a traffic accident and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a stone break on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, who belongs to the dog, came to the stonebreak Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby back and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing female and published help calls on social networks when she was caught in the stonebreak after the small traffic accident.
About 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday saw a walker carrying out his dog, the stranded Ruby on the 15-foot-high sell in the stonebreak.
The technical rescue team of Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and sailed off to rescue Ruby, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and bottom.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue - she was like stiff-frozen.
But now she's doing well.
She then ate a few chickens.
This was a rather unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said, \"Ruby had a huge luck.
It was possible that she was seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was investigated as a veterinarian, but did not determine anything except education and dehydratement.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Looking at the rescue was scary.
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back in the arms.
The vet explained that if it was too big and it was broken up, it would probably collapse.
Firefighters have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid that she would fall down, but she stayed up.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains that he never created Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she had worked as a background singer to Jagger’s song “Old Habits The Hard” from 2004.
Perry explained that she ate with the old rocker at night, and that “he had raised me when I was 18”
She added: “It’s been a long time since, and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he “categorically denied that he has ever made approach attempts at Katy Perry.”
The representative added: “Perhaps she has confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones Tour this year.
Her new album, Prism, landed on Anhieb at number 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European escape gives the Scots the choice
A New Day, a New Fear Story of Independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen Community as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire-secured border along the Hadrian Wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde proposal pointed to the possible economic advantages that would bring more travel freedom in the rest of Europe, but this, according to expectation, did not play a role in the headlines.
Also, no one has mentioned that EU Member States often deal with their strict rules if it is more favorable for them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen Area, the continued non-observation to Brussels would be only a small grant in return for what is really wanted by the Scots.
Not actually a story.
And one who has come so early in the years that it has already been like a fossil: the first time I heard the “Independence Means Pass Controls” Ents at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should you expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why is London’s yoke against Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for Europe's union was put to the fore after the war.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Everywhere in the EU, parties gain ground that is hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro on board as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party was able to earn almost five million votes for itself in the German election in September, effectively evicting the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict savings policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the forced jack in which the national economy is required by holding on to the common currency, many people feel that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are causing excessive budget deficits - that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has established its members on exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters - and would like to let German politicians do that.
Without the possibility of a evaluation of the local currency, southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage to Germany.
The only way to cut wages and public spending is to be encouraged by Berlin.
Behind the current etat and currency problems is a deep European productivity problem.
As a result of Brussels's \"green - energy policies - a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - the European industry is paying double for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States.
This is a deplorable cost disadvantage as we could see in Grangemouth.
The European petrochemical industry does not protect the world from being pushed into the corner by cheap American sliding gas.
As a result, a revolt is drawing up, especially in France, the EU's first cheerleader.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a slavery with which to hold Germany in check and raise Paris at the height of Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed Europe up its own economic policy, which has to fight the attacked French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pens has just won a decisive post-election by the EU-opposite Front National and has thus turned the ruling socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the voter vote - a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits to the left.
What makes Le Pen with their newly won popularity among the white French of the working class?
It will use the EU elections next year to block an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut well in these elections, and this is very well possible, then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point on which I want to go: In no way will the growing resentiment against the EU and the common currency come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the Europe of the (Sovereign) Nations that favors General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite countries may hold on to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that the UK will be reliant on this project, hoping to smile at the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the latter).
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I suspect Scotland could drive very well in a more loose European association, if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries, which are similar to other countries, is easier in a non-federated Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider the same thing as Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is the most successful political movement against austerity policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and conducted) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the following Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to choose independence now, only to get a savings policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Getting Faster
African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age companions, as studies show.
Physical changes do not mean the puberty right now
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is an trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter is already growing breasts and shames at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the Children’s Medical Association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents — usually it’s not a sign that the puberty is rapidly entering,” Kaplowitz explained.
Public displays of development, such as growing breasts, shame and axel hair as well as body smell, show up in girls earlier.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (representing the first rule blood) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“If the development of the breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years until the menarche,” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book Early Puberty in Girls: The essential counselor for dealing with this common problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually represents the beginning of puberty, but it is 'frozen' if the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth shift of eight years ago.
In most cases, the process or stagnant slows down - something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
In the event of rapid progress, tests may be shown by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be eliminated.
There are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and defense of another consequence: premature aging of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are oriented at the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant about medication, but he boasts: “Suppressing puberty can milden behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their peers of age,” he says.
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side,” Kaplowitz said.
\"It was a shock - remember a woman who got her daughter with ten days.
Although there were first signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She got scared and excited from school home because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no clear evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be responsible.
Young people come to puberty in the same way as girls used to.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premium is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine years, producing a link between body fat and entry to puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white age companions.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all possible things, from economic conditions across the climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow face and shame hair earlier, the trend toward a full-fledged earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and sham hair is spread even among babies and grandchildren.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the true beginning of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a medical endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to consult with their child’s doctor on how to talk to their child.
“That can mean having to take a conversation earlier than expected,” said Kaplowitz.
When you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls that bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argued in the face of large orders about seat width
Among leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a controversy over the width of seats in the tourist class in long-distance flights, indicating the tone for a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the width of the seat, which passengers are offered on long flights in the tourist class, not always the ones that airlines strive most, but this proven space is the key to the efficiency claims in the latest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus demanded an industry standard this week, which sets a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the U.S. arch rival Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builders are betting to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-distance pilots, and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed - in particular whether there are rows with nine or ten seats - is crucial for the stated economic results to deliver the new mini-jumbo design.
Boeing claims that its modernised 777X is 406 people in the tourist class who are more than 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transported 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Airplane giants often share levers over technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus appeals to the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the start of a new ad war and showed donors a picture in which three people were chained together in a restaurant, and the title was, “Will you accept it”
\"Boeing suggests long-range flights in seats that are lower than regional turbo-props, says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
In view of changing nutrition habits, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American increased by 10 percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the U.S. Department of Health data.
According to U.S. health statistics, the size of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says his rival held on to a 1950s seat concept when the average body scope of the newly baptized \"Jet Set\" was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been conducted that have shown that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increased sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing argues with Airbus’s numbers on the seat dimensions and says it is not up to the manufacturer to decide how airlines will balance airfares and equipment.
The company also explains that according to investigations, the experience on the plane depends on more than the width of the seat.
“It really goes beyond giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to do to be successful — explains the airline expert Kent Craver from Boeing.
They don’t want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, there is more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it becomes increasingly a subject that can affect sales.
Behind the dispute is a flight order race with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion by list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-distance designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X is compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per row.
“Boeing is therefore asking for more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products,” says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row for existing 777s, pointed out that many passengers decided on the closer arrangement, which could go with cheaper airfares.
“Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat through the 777,” says Mary Kirby, an expert in cabinet equipment, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-wide jet sellers even contribute to the band size to measure the facility at the competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not yet sold any according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more customizability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the roads for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer, great modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to be puffed up, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make smoking a delight
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine infection for a lifetime.
Prior to human tests, further attempts are needed, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers to stop trying to stop and try out all the methods available on the market, but must experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than those approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed in such a way that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before reaching the brain, so a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In trials, infected mice given nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination would have taken a “outtime,” the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given to maintain the level of antibodies so often that they were expensive and unpractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it turns liver cells into antibodies factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be given to people if they are absolutely safe before they are tempted to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
It is more likely, however, that smokers would use it to stop.
“When they start to smoke again, they no longer feel pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to put off the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi contended to be influenced by obesity
The former Minister of the Labor Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales will launch an investigation into state corruption surveillance.
The former NSW minister objected to changing the rules for maritime impeachment at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden shares in three estates on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission on Corruption) expanded its investigation into whether Obeid had influenced various state ministers to hold contracts at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without extending aid after their departure in August 2005.
Now it is determined due to the charge that Tripodi had known of Obeid’s concealed interest in the estates after Tripodi’s former deputy staffmate Lynne Ashpole declared it appropriate on Thursday.
In years of discussions, which began in 2005, the government had pushed on public requests for the farm contracts.
The farmers were opposed, and they wanted longer periods of time.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the companies at Circular Quay, which brought the obeisance to $2.5 million annually, were extended without public tenders.
Tripodi, who served as a port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken out for public requests.
However, he objected to having made the changes to requests from Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a re-designation of the government's duties.
One of the ICAC’s texts showed conversations from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading official who moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the fishing authority.
“The topic discussed in these telephone conversations was the preparation of commercial maintenance arrangements,” Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked.
“No,” Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was being discussed, but it was definitely not.
Not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighter aircraft attack target in Syria, according to official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed a leading government employee to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the goal was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already launched air strikes on missile supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457-visa could be subjected to the test of nationality
As part of the extended measures, the government is thinking about a “religion test” for foreign workers with 457 visas.
If the test is introduced, it will be used over a criterion to prevent 457 from occupying unqualified jobs or as a back door for the addition of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew, who condemned government comments regarding foreign workers because they could be taken as insult by neighboring Australia.
“Laute statements like ‘foreigners are supposed to work behind’ and ‘Australians first set’ are a very unpleasant setback in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white labour market should be protected — and if some in the region were to ruin an echo of this historic architecture, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The discussion proposal covers twelve measures once taken by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who spent yesterday talking about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes that others are still considering.
If the “Activity Criterion” is taken over, someone requesting a visa could be checked to see if “the application is real in the cases where the applicant is related or personally linked to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company”
Companies could also be obliged to pay account of the number of 457 visa holders after in the past, companies who initially wanted to support only a small number of workers, eventually set hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylant probably died of a heart attack after arriving this week on the island of Christmas.
The man’s son, who had come with him to Australia, has been cared for by an adult cousin since his father’s death on Wednesday, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study was announced by the British government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to establish high-speed connections between Scotland and northern England at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “will bring Britain closer together”
Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed train connection between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern Ireland from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern Ireland and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time from finally three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together.
We go ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it’s also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: “Today’s announcement is a good news for Scotland.”
In the name of the Scottish government, Keith Brown urged Carmichael to use himself “inconspicuously” for the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail connection offers the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland’s economic power also provides an argument for rapid rail connections across the UK.
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to investigate the options for a high-speed train connection in Scotland that creates benefits for all and complements the link Glasgow-Edinburgh that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the British ministers next year and making the next steps together.
Rules on electronic devices in aircraft remain temporary in force in Australia
Australian flight passengers must also continue to turn off tablets and smartphones at launch and landing, despite efforts in the United States to lock down the regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their standards so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, if they are in flight mode.
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do this, but many people are angry that they may not read their e-books when starting and landing.
Australian companies observe the decision to which U.S. airlines will have to make unparalleled jobs, but do not pursue any immediate plans to amend their regulations.
The CASA Air Security Authority also explained that the announcement will be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
“CaSA currently has no specific rules regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft,” it said.
The issue is subject to provisions which, according to airlines, maintain safety at any time and that passengers must follow the safety instructions given by the cabin staff.
Virgin has already conducted conversations with the CASA about an extension of its Wi-Fi maintenance system on flights and explained that they should be open to changes, but they should be initiated by the legislator.
“We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the CASA, as we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we offer (draftless entertainment) during the flight,” said a spokesperson.
Qantas explained that you will remain with the current rules until more.
“Our current policies provide that electronic devices should not be used when starting and landing, and we do not currently have plans to change that,” the company said.
FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from, and we will definitely take a closer look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision affects American societies differently depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disruptions through mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, handbag programs and customer instruction.
“After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book reading devices and smartphones at any level,” the FAA announced.
In rare cases, the crew will indicate passengers to turn off the equipment during the landing.
The group also recommends that heavier equipment be stored safely under the seat or in the compartments over the seats when starting and landing.
Before the revierderby against Schalke, co-created BVB supporters had provided lighting missiles for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced hard consequences.
Prior to the Friday game of the football association league against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost already Spenstic acoustic, which offered itself to the viewer until shortly before the appearance of the Bundesliga game between the German champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Iduna Park signal.
Listening to most of the guests with their songs.
On the other hand, where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stood, the first presented themselves with extraordinary silence: no songs, no battle calls.
The pod of the capo, which otherwise coordinated the common anger, remained unoccupied.
And in front of the tribune, a large flag with the inscription “Sektion Stadium Ban” was wrought.
Only as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always as a first BVB player entered the place, burned up short-term cheer.
As his teammates followed, there was loud singing and worrisome shells - but for a long time not everywhere.
There is nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern tribunals.
Even that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again recounted the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not ensure celebration.
Only five minutes before the offer, the capo picked up its podium - and the tension that could be grasped by hand until that time was revealed in a loud scream, as Dickel, as usual, questioned the mood on the runs at the stadium.
The last was as always the southern tributaries on the line - and finally here was again as usual the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the end of the day when, with the request of the South Triumph, the loud call “Derby Winner” came up, everything was back as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before Revierby at FC Schalke 04, some of the co-created BVB trailers had fired light rockets into the spectators' slopes and on the pitch - and almost hit tortoise Roman Weidenfellers.
The game was started late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras in his office, and believed Watzkes' words, this was a rather uncompromising appointment for the fans.
“There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-motion,” the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening on a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As a immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras from choreographing a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
“I have forbidden that,” he said.
We cannot give up zero tolerance policy in terms of pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultra's various possibilities of punishment were shown - until Tuesday they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will set a sanctions by the end of next week.
“That’s going to be cutting-edge, assured Watzke.
One may be tense about how the reactions to the southern tributary fall.
Pandhouses are booming in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle layer
In a Pfandhaus in the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanged a golden arm tyre, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of their daughters.
“My husband and I have just bought a house, because my whole money is in it,” Amirthalinga says.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) every month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income does not extend, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where the debt of the households is increasing - is so great that ValueMax, where she made her exchange, became the third Pandhouse listed on the Singaporean stock exchange this week.
Donating jewelry is not only a quick way to get money — $1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga — but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Pandhouses in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just over 15.4%, which the United Overseas Bank requires, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
Pandhouses, however, offer the advantage that no review of creditworthiness or income evidence is required here, which is why loans are faster than possible with banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to Pandhouses after families feel pressured by increasing living costs as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose financial policy in developed economic areas, families with lower and medium-income income seek to compensate for the difference in the economy.
This week, the Rating Agency Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, referred to as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the Agency, have the highest household debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent still in 2008.
Economicians are also concerned about high consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has barely come out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a drop in consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that in view of increasing costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical high prices in the last two years have further strengthened the trend toward paving personal items, as people are taking advantage of the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the products in the town state are gold.
People say, “The gold price looks good, let’s get our grandmother’s gold chain and get back next month.
The largest Thai farm operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent customer growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the Pand business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 more in Singapore, not only wants to expand into neighboring Malaysia, where the company operates four homes, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, managing director of Value Zall.
The company is funding the 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it took with the stock exchange in Singapore this week.
While some creditors were in cross-fire due to high interest rates, Yeah explains that Pandhouses not only offered cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly raise the debt.
“Kunds borrow items they already own, and the liquidating of personal values does not increase household protection,” she explains.
The loan loan business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secure funding.
Also, not all people who use loan loans are in financial trouble.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in bar.
Customers come from every social layer.
“That includes wealthy people who are short-term loaning something for a business or investment, or small companies who have to bridge tights in the cash flow,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The Secret Service Revealer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to clarify the ever-brightening NSA spraying business.
Following the presentation of the Green Country Day Commander Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia concerned about the conditions under which ex-secret service employees would speak to a German prosecutor or before an investigation committee.
Snowden has referred to his complicated legal situation, said Ströbele to ARD magazine “Panorama”
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government consists of the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package over $325 million for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “unfavourable measures” to avoid a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The funding for a period of four years was decided by government advisers with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has cut down an emergency recovery package, which we think is about the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said today.
The $325-million package includes $31 million in emergency aid for electoral services.
Further 2600 operations, including orthopedic interventions and treatments due to gray star, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-care after stationary stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
“These investments correspond to the ideas that have been told to me by the clinic staff concerned that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,” Tanya Plibersek said.
The minister was on a strict reporting and accountability duty of the Tasmanian government.
The State must maintain the current level of funding in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission shall be established and shall ensure that state health services provide as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie pointed out today, the $325 million would benefit only if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course”
This, however, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed against the Prime Minister in early May.
“I am confident that the federal aid will contribute a great deal to taking the state’s public health system out of the concern list,” Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state, these electoral benefits will largely match the recent cuts.
But the opposition’s health-political spokesman at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today’s announcement is just a “plastor solution”
“We are therefore in a position today because the Labor State Government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system,” he told ABC TV.
It can’t be that a state government almost half a billion dollars from the system and is putting in the Commonwealth 300 million and then doing so as if it were the good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek not to spend a single dollar of the rescue package for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also more difficult cost than necessary.
The action played in France in the 1760s tells the taking story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips into lukewarmness or sensuousness - and there lies its problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes him a bad bout shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and poison gas ammunition facilities, the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on Thursday, while in the north of the country there were serious collisions near one of the locations where supposedly toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people since the beginning of the civil war had been killed three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Banning of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date
November 1st, which the Haag-based organization had set up Damascus to destroy or inoperate all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, including all machines for mixing chemicals to poison gas and filling ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including Senfgas and the nerve gas Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when on Thursday fighting took place in the city of Safira, experts said there was a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses here, as the United Kingdom-based Syrian Human Rights Observatory said.
The activist group, which was pursuing the number of dead over a network of activists in Syria, declared that 120,296 people had died on Thursday.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not been updated so far.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels for weeks in Safira, many of which have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The observation site said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention details.
The fights highlight the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syria from its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a tolling civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is now convinced that it has seen and experienced all the major production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria.
That’s why “no other inspection activities are currently planned -
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
Because of security concerns, the visit of two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC declared that the two sites were \"disbanded\" according to the Syrian statement, and the existing objects of the chemical weapons program were attached to other mentioned facilities which were inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has proposed a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will have to be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC next month.
“I draw the hat from the bravery and courage that you have shown all of the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, the director-general of the monitoring organization in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad’s government and its security forces, which many members of the Alawites belong to, a division of Shiite Islam.
In view of further developments, the leader of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Anger over judgment for Bali's bomb army
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing were angry at the judgment of the last of the prosecutors who was put to court, as Umar Patek’s view was to be shot down.
Patek, who had been fleeing Southeast Asia for almost ten years as one of the most sought-after persons, was sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence for his role in building explosives for the bomb attack.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A charge was also made in a series of terrorist-related charges, which included a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor had demanded a life imprisonment, even if it was referred to as a \"demolition man\" for the man who could have applied for the death penalty because of his reputation as a master bomber.
The decision has sparked painful memories at June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the confusion committed by Patek and his co-soldiers nearly ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“You should put him before a shooting command,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live with every day that I won't have any other grandson and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was equalized to the ground floor when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23 p.m., a huge bomb exploded in a small-loader parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide killer had exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into coma for a month after the attack and died three times while hanging on a life maintenance system.
Hughes said Patek had earned the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were responsible for the massacre and executed four years ago.
In fact, this type should be given the death penalty for everyone else.
To let him live, no, there is no reason to let him live.
To get 20 years after killing 202 people and hurting many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber in court.
He narrowly escaped a decade of arrest, but was finally captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the negotiations, an FBI agent said that secret service reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the goal of rebuilding the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
“He didn’t stand up,” Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no repentance for how much suffering he has added to other people.
The verdict came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be celebrated in Bali and Australia.
“There will be many tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal to his judgment.
FAA: passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not conduct mobile calls)
Flight travelers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies from departure to landing, but not by phone, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they were implemented to depart from the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight personnel as well as the arrangements for dismantling the equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“Despite the condition of the plan, we could soon approve the extended use of electronic devices,” the FAA announced in an announcement.
At present, passengers need to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
You can only start it again when the plane has reached an altitude of three kilometers and gives the captain green light.
Upon entering the landing flight, the passengers must turn them off again and must not launch them again before the plane landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the equipment even when starting, landing and rolling, the FAA said.
Most new vehicles and other aircraft that have been re-equipped at greater altitudes for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
\"If the new regulation is implemented safely - and we work closely with the airline - both sides will benefit - commented Glading.
We are honestly sorry to have to feel on this topic as caretakers.
However, internet connections to surf, exchange of emails, text messages or download of data under three kilometers were still banned, the authority said.
Passengers are asked to place smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So there is still no “Words With Friends” the scrabble-like online game played by actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 on his smartphone when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the flight.
And heavier devices like laptops must continue to be understood, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Phone conversations during the flight are also still banned.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is not with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
FAA may impose bans on certain electronic devices on launch and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker, from the Transport Safety Authority National Transportation Safety Board, said security experts on national traffic issues on CBS News, would still consider mobile phones as a risk.
“Hence is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential disruptions in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also disrupt transmitters,” says Rosenker.
A consulting committee of the industry, which was launched by the FAA to investigate this subject, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represent the view that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to put through because the use of the devices has become widespread.
In some studies, it is said that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the turn off of the device.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by flight travelers in 1966, after reports of disruptions in navigation and communication devices were made known by passenger-carried UKW radios, which were then the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed in such a way and approved by the FAA that they do not make any difference in electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for a few years when the flight height is reached.
The pilots adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally give off significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only give off minimal radiation when it is wrapped around.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
The defendants of a lock-up of the restrictions on device use by passengers include Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems but could not find out.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he felt that the disruption by the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only separate reports of pilots speaking for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the FAA recommended that pilots be allowed to order the turn off of the equipment by the passengers during instrument landing under poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a reasonable adjustment for travelers who would be fully equipped with technology today.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
By Air Rescue Service of North Sea Bohr Island Rescued Bird
An air rescue service to the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea bohr island, was released back to nature.
The water hall was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was pampered by the Scottish animal protection organization SPCA in its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: “This water rink was probably a winter draw bird from northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds above the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drill island.
He added: “He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help.”
When it was released, the water hall was again fit and healthy.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in the UK want to change to our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and have asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 leaders from the economy, who pictured in about the UK sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be surprising.
We have found that the majority of companies are now exporting outside of Europe and focusing on countries that modernize and grow while states are stagnating in the EU.
They want new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil to be favored by the government side rather than with the long and demanding process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
Asked in their view on certain legally regulated issues - from card law to product legislation - the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key skills should be recovered according to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction over the internal market, as, according to the statement, the companies would consider the costs of Brussels’ regulations to be a part of Europe’s trading zone, even 40 percent of large enterprises agreed to be the most traditionally European-friendly.
Finally, and this probably says most, our survey of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of the UK wants a course towards change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade does not rely on politics.
This knowledge, found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “sensible change” that brings the load of action back to the UK.
A change in the agreement and better conditions for the United Kingdom would lead to a 16 percent change of opinion in favour of the EU remaining in a popular agreement.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the UK economy is behind its plan for renegotiating British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power ratios back to the UK from a new deal.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the Eurozone is moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means an increased focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations for companies.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom called Pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new Gaza
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom Board said.
\"Today's event is a milestone: The construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream Gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun - said Gazprom's CEO Alexei Miller in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to provide more diversity in Russia’s export routes across Europe.
A treaty between Gazprom and its pendant in Ukraine, where the majority of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, creates an increased risk of conventional routes, as can be heard from official site.
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks linked to transit countries were \"forever.\"
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream to favored tariffs when the entire project is under operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subsequent countries is to begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed to have an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.

This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country in comparison.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed to this on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
As sought-after German commercial properties are, the view of the transaction volume, according to Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year's section.
In the UK, the plus was only 6%, in France at 19%.
“Immobilization investments offer attractive interest rates,” Ulbrich said.
The return distance between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.
The FAA will lock restrictions on the use of electronic devices in aircraft - even if the phone call is still banned.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offences before charges against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) have been charged with sexual abuse in connection with children before 2011 charges against child care worker Jonathan Lord from Caringbah were filed, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children experienced.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had declared that \"in the organization, it had never had to deal with an incident of sexual child abuse\"
Chief Executive Officer Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of abuse of children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission’s assistants, knew from the first case, did not know the second but did not know.
He admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement to the Commission was also unacquainted with the claim that “it has given external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognized as a front-front to child safety,”
Evidence before the Commission shows, rather, that the YMCA has been taught that it has received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA with 21 years ago, admitted that the management had, from me down, failed to stop Lord and did not guarantee that employees had been aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety guidelines.
Lord was sentenced to 12 boys in the beginning of the year for sexual offense during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, Hare argues that the YMCA had a cultural problem that kept employees from reporting to Lord's violations regarding the safety of children.
The staff said they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, she privately cheated as a babysitter, let them sit on his lap, said he loved it, and allowed children to play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because of her behavior, said that the child service director Jacqui Barnat, who was the CEO of the YMCA Caringbah, was “very appalling and most of the time very close.”
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees to which they did not trust to report their superiors.
Instead, he said, rather, her friendship with the Lord affected her judgment, which is why they did not report him.
Hare explained that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson the organization had to draw from the “Jonathan Lord’s case” — not reporting — was by employees, and the board agreed to him.
Hare said the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations occurred was made by the managing director of the child services of YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent the contamination of the evidence, which, however, has been “extremely” and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization between 2009 and 2011, explained Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual child abuse, the Commission.
He explained that there have been \"serious problems\" in the attitude, review, preparation, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was held until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would take advantage of the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister, but he admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided expressing himself to British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and its role as envoy of the Quartet of Peace Founders in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister’s office, Blair was quoted by Evening Standard from London as saying: “Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ...”
When the horse show experts found themselves in Sharen in Cardiff to shorten the horse of the year, they were aware that a tough competition was ahead.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in the kindergarten and just a few months ago took his first steps, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee quietly passed through the three rounds and got the first prize - leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable pair, both equally large, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style in the annual competition, which is performed by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had his counter nut set up at a generous angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which lie far above his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then practiced with the Shetland Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are a great treat.
They had to step against the entire field of participants and went out of place with Goldpokal and Rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been riding horses for over ten years.
Howells said: “The whole audience was like electrified and all of them fired him and chatted him.”
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is mad at animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
As he started, it won't take long for him to be on the \"Peard of the Year\" and I'm sure he'll be cut off well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said, “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The jurors then judged Fenton and Toffee how well they had beaten themselves and presented themselves in the lead ring.
They looked forward to good cooperation between Pony and Leader - and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes contributed their part to this, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper is to be “reformed” after calling
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter who had been charged with discrimination, was reformed on the title page, a press regulator said.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou, had printed a rare public call to release journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fake reports of a state-owned company.
Now, the New Express will be subject to a \"comprehensive rectification,\" the regulatory authority said.
The “Rectification Order” came from the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Provisional investigations revealed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inappropriate reports about the company Zoomlion listed between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the New Express was unordered,” the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that one has decided to “hang an administrative punishment for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license”
In addition, “Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to make a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant controllers be identified at the New Express and check the management team of the New Express immediately.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two calls for its release on the title page and was behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence,” he said to the state news channel, though.
I did it primarily because I was on money and fame.
I'm aware that I've acted wrongly.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the title page and stated that it was failed to verify the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently filed on television stands.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a legislative change in the beginning of the year in which authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse himself.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railway between the United States and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for the drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-and-90-centimeter measuring tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they have ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless invisible warehouses, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drug users could be transported into it, the authorities said.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were guaranteed, according to the court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities’ statement, worked as drivers were charged with possession and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They threaten a sentence of imprisonment between ten years and a lifetime.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage, which has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartel to challenge how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found an almost 640-metre-long pass with rails, which ran from a kitchen in a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has expressed itself to separate his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, \"life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope for it.\"
Kerr and he still loved himself, emphasized the 36-year-old.
“We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn.
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and her son Flynn was born in 2011.
Veganism, according to Lexika, is subjected to vegetarianism, but it differs in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to consume Sahnetorte, ice cream or a powerful Edamer, these mummies are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the rejection of meat and fish, the vegan leaves off from eating animal products - including honey.
What remains may be asked, but in closer consideration, the vegan diet world is characterized by a significant incidence.
“Brothers are very popular,” explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the so-called Reform House, who provides a variety of special products for Vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store in the domgas.
For 13 years, the native New Zealander vegan lives, in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs for life.
At the turn of the century, the next step took place and I became a Vegan.
“The conviction, however, came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes,” says Proctor, who prefers the leather of art leather.
He recognized that there are also other everyday concerns without animal products.
First of all, vegan is an ethics.
“I don’t want animals to die for me,” Proctor expresses the maximum of vegans that extend to the entire consumer behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, stirrs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products that increased enthusiasm.
“It’s a double bonus,” says Proctor today, “at least vegan doesn’t make up for being a forget, not an ascetic, but it’s an enriching - the assumption that you reduce the selection of food options with food conversion rather leads to the power of habit.
And that’s exactly how some of these conditions have failed so well combined attempts.
“The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that leaves many quick to give up, similar to smoking,” Proctor makes a comparison.
And he says, “Some tastes are not tied to the animal.”
Often it is the spices or the kind of ingredients that make up the taste.
“But you can also generate the same effect in other ways,” explains the vegan.
For example, proctor brings aubergins, champignons and also a few vegan sausages to a grill.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet in which it should taste a lot.
Of course, you want something between the teeth, that is legitimate.
“It should taste, but it’s not just to reduce on animal food,” Proctor said.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I do not take on any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin share.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively vegan.
“My blood levels are best, I often let myself check,” Proctor advises me.
In particular, before the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus critics warn.
“Since animals are fed with feed instead of grassing on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the cold-dry, the vitamin-B12 portion is high - finds proctor.
For Vegans, there is also the possibility of taking the co enzyme in the form of tablets.
“My B12 values are fine,” he explains.
Many ways proctors don’t have to go for food procurement.
In the end, there are basic foods everywhere and each supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need is on site.
I only buy something special from time to time.
“Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but so do ‘common’ finished products as well.
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes was far more favorable and less time-consuming than commonly accepted.
“In the kitchen there is a lot to discover, with a few small knees you can achieve good if not partially better results,” says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cake, Proctor was also able to make his brother-in-law's parents marvel.
Family festivals give the Vegan a new wort.
This has dynamics when you buy together, it has a new priority.
“The situations that can arise here are as different as the people themselves,” Proctor says.
Of course, scepticism was also introduced to him.
Don't taste my food anymore?
“Should I feel bad now because I drink milk - in such cases you have to act as a vegan with a fingertip feeling.
\"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society - proctor doesn't want to freeze enclaves.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not appear to be as vegan as it is supposed - and the vegan does not seem as limited in everyday life as it is commonly accepted.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
“Many dinner shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka,” Proctor says.
In a pizzeria, it softs out on pasta dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slow about it.
“When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult — the New Zealander could find out a development: “You have to talk to people, make them aware of it.”
“If enough demand comes, they may be inclined to supplement the menu,” he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, for example, the bowls in Manhattan or the cafe bird-free.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are available for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
On the other hand, meat dishes are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others - Proctor states.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make the greatest part impossible from the outset,” Proctor says.
Buying vegan products, however, can be a bit difficult at first.
In particular, if you learn to understand that even in peanuts, animal additives can be used as colorers, you seem to quickly leave the courage by following ethics in so many obstacles and falls.
Not only for this reason, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: “Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives - explains the many ingredients that are added to food and cleaning products.
“After all, you develop a scanner look and know what characters and logos you have to pay attention to — sometimes it’s better to take small steps than to stand or to stoop — white proctor.
Veganism, he is an important moral fingernacle that hits the consciousness.
Perhaps he does not quite manage to put down his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to critically question his habits.
The Nasdaq OMX stock exchange operator continues to breathe its customers.
Trade at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other 11 US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues an entire series of smaller and larger panels at the stock exchange operator.
It was not until Tuesday that the Nasdaq indexes were not calculated for one hour due to data transport errors.
In August of this year there were two panels in one week alone.
First, U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massive incorrect purchase orders to the option markets because of technical problems.
Thereafter, the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to view and strike the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trading in the U.S. came to the Nasdaq exchange for several hours because of a computer pan.
In addition, last year Facebook’s stock exchange course had been provided for.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sales orders, later established the exchange surveillance SEC and donated the company to a record fine of $10 million.
Constance: Radler is driving 63-year-olds
The accident was reported by the police when a 26-year-old man, at 22 a.m., was on the left foot from the railway station towards the market site.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly walked from a local on the road, the cyclist could no longer slow down in time.
In the next collapse, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the further course, and pulled a 15-centimeter-long space wound on the head.
A rescue car team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police have issued an extradition notice to Assange
The British police today handed an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard explained that a call was made to the 40-year-old Australian, who asked him to appear in a police station, and added that he should not comply, threatening him to be arrested.
Assange threatens the extradition to Sweden for the charge in a sexual offence after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court has denied his opposition to the extradition in the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would deliver him to the U.S., he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard, a 40-year-old man, made a call to stand at a police station at a time we had chosen, said a spokesperson.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the provision of the police call.
Assange fears that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible espionage allegations after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Drivers with 210 km/h and hot drink between legs receive £1000 penalty
A car driver was imposed a penalty of £1,000 because he was driven with up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After he stopped the police, they discovered the cup of wine between his legs.
In front of the Colchester court, Howie became guilty of not being the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to payment of costs of £90 and a victim sum of £100.
Tax for foreign property owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally scalded the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of treasurer George Osborne, who had imposed a 7% stamp tax on apartments in the 2012 budget, costing over two million pounds as well as annual fees for buyers holding apartments as a company and not as individuals.
The income from the stamp tax for residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which were in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeded 708 million pounds, totaling the proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increases in stamp tax on high-priced apartments and the introduction of the related legislation against a transaction, one can seriously claim that high-quality property is too low taxed, regardless of the effects of the outdated community tax system.”
“By this step, some foreign investors could make the purchase of real estate in London more resilient, or keep owners from selling it,” he added.
First-class real estate - the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price - in the prosperous London Southeast belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has earned 11.8% in last year.
Prices in Central London show a uniform annual growth of 5.6%, but were exceeded by an emerging domestic market where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the connection between the tailing of a dog with its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail were more beaded to the right (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: “Beim people are well known that the left and right brain half respond differently to stimuli that produce positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right brain half is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the lateral tailing of their species, the researchers monitored the animals while these films saw other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
We will probably soon understand why the tail moves in one direction, once in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dogs movies with dogs — either a natural faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, allowing us to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.
When the animals saw an otherwise unsuspecting dog moving the tail to the right (seeing from the perspective of the beading dog), they remained completely relaxed.
However, the tail inclination was mainly to the left (returning from perspective of the dog weeding), so their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not communicate deliberately with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience, in which movements they should be concerned about and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and wetting with the tail in a direction is more linked to friendly behavior and the right side is more likely to produce a less friendly behavior, then you respond based on these experiences.
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and coaches to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behavior and guest scholarship at the University of Bristol’s Faculty of Animal Health, explained that this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right are important to dogs.
Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it comes to a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was: “Hundreds are more likely to go to a robotic dog when his ‘swant’ is on the left and not right, rather than becoming restless, just different from in the Italian study.
According to his statement, the differences could therefore touch that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he said.
“There is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brains are used for different purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined — and dogs don’t make an exception — according to Bradshaw.
However, since their behavior is easy to record, it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys move appearance in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a performance in Glasgow after their lead singer has suffered from throat inflammation.
The band from Sheffield should play in the hydro on Friday.
Due to the disease of lead singer Alex Turner, however, the concert has to be moved.
The band's announcement came after she had previously had to move a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After deciding to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show in the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st.
“At Alex Turner a throat head inflammation was diagnosed, which is why he can’t appear,” he said.
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, which was moved to November 21 in the hydro in Glasgow.
All tickets are valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket owners for the inconveniences resulting from this.
Please contact the customer service agency where you bought your ticket if you need further support.
Pope Francis appoints First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be the first to appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the pope and they are also the ones who choose a pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men, who will ultimately be involved in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal, who has reached an 80-year-old age, can no longer participate in the papal election, which is due to a group of 120 eligible cardinals.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said it will be held a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony is held to appoint the new cardinals, who were also known as consistory.
Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to call the Consistory in advance in February so that other meetings that require the participation of Cardinals from around the world can be planned,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals will probably be reduced by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals can be 120 again, and as many cardinals as 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year is therefore significant because it was the first since the election of Francis in March this year, said Valero.
There is currently a certain overhang on the other side of Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to appoint the Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, who have been commissioned to find opportunities to reform the Church.
In the past, the pope decided everything alone.
“Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He explained that it was \"good possible\" that Francis would ask the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been able to do that - that's all new.
Valero said that typically the bishops would call the cardinals from large places, but Francis “full of surprises,” so we don’t know who he appoints.”
GM calls new pickup trucks back in the United States to repair the seat loan
General Motors called back almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to solve a problem with the manually adjustable seat loan, according to a U.S. regulatory authority for vehicle safety on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for restoring the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety in the case of head support.
“If the vehicle is driven from behind, it is possible that the head support does not properly protect the inmates, so that there is an increased risk of injury,” read the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The returned models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading U.S. car manufacturer since the insolvence-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA could not check the notification letter due to the 16-day Government Shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redeveloped for the 2014 model year, has increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM stock rose by 1.4% on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
A Obama voter's despair
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been neglected by Republican blockade tactics
Blocking policy does not excuse Obamacare's website problems, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I am currently reading a terriblely sad book.
It's a book I believed it would turn me up and give me hope during the mysterious second year of my medical studies.
It is called “The Audacity to Win” and tells the memoirs Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential election.
When I’m done with my patient inscriptions in the evening and go to bed, the book leads me back to a time when the politics inspired millions and a speech could rob the breath.
The election was held as a disaster-stricken and news spokesperson in order to highlight the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried out for joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved into office in 2008, he had approvals of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Moving back to the present is a bad awakening as if you are being torn out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague reminder, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first gave up my voice, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced disappearance of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that the party political blockade tactics have peaked too many efforts that our nation should be brought forward with: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to name a few.
But after I have defended the Obama government countless times against colleagues and acquaintances, I have reached the end of my explanation attempts.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why the removal of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private life of Americans and why whistleblowers are being punished, revealing state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without proceedings, nor why the public funding and spending limits will be dealt with during presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report which states that the White House's efforts to calm the media are the most aggressive ... since the Nixon government.
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I don't know if this is what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood by 18 that government work could contradict the political campaigns ahead of it.
Obviously, the MP is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public discussion.
But if I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself.
And that hurts me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unexplained alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free of the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope of which we had heard for so long.
But with the sinking of Obama’s approval values to under 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become so harsher.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have been resolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to strike a heavy loss against Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electors after the decision, he told his employees that they would have to come back to course and follow the purpose of their business.
“I want us to find our magic again,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest on parental leave
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters get pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a court dispute over paying $6 million in CO2 taxes, raised the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table about whether he was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether or not the CO2 and mining taxes are being deleted.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflict of interest and the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
“He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not he gets vacations,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer election commission officially declared the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes.
Palmer called for a revision of the process for voice counting so that it could go faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why should we not have a system in which to march data into a computer, immediately select it, and then get the result at 6:30 p.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot.
Do you use them because you can then get rid of the results if you don’t like one?
Today, matching pencils with pencils is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has reviewed the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policies include an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office \"very seriously.\"
A public office is about the service to the public.
“We strive for no reward except history, that we can serve in a critical time of this community,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange department, so two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide official investigation into the alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly on the rise.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities in the world’s largest financial market, on which $5.3 billion a day replaces the owner.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that the scandal is drawing around the Libor interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
“Our investigations on this subject continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation indicated that the RBS had passed the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a former dealer to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is now planning to be retired from his current position as European leader of the Forex-Spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was retired this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
The Usher instant message group included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, the situation said nearby people.
UBS announced this week that it has taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma declared that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide — the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are currently engaged in allegations about which bankers should have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said familiar people.
Banks get instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has put the dealers in a riot area that has been one of the most profitable of investment banks’ trading units in recent years, but this year has been under pressure because low-volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play the affair down and said it was almost impossible to manipulate the expanded and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading, the fragmenting of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks led to the fact that “we can influence the market even with very low ticket prices.”
The news came out on the same day as Credit Suisse announced she had announced this week to a trader of her London Exchange Traded Funds office after he had caused a loss of almost six million dollars at the end of last year.
The bank immediately informed the competent authorities and worked with them.
“We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the business has been slowed down,” explained Credit Suisse.
Painted on the Bechtle base
A group of citizens’ initiative, Schweizer Wiese, has decorated the building fence on the Bechtle base at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and spread the footway, said it in a press release.
The planned cover of the collapsed house in the rear part of the property had not been allowed for security reasons, as the site threatened to collapse.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed with his colleague Reinhard Domke about the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparent with the message “We’ve been attached to it.”
However, this did little to upset the about 20 members of the Civil Initiative in their actions.
Your motto on the big poster was called “We are against the ruins”
So she wanted to point to the danger of even greater ruins in the Swiss manner - the giant project should fail one day.
In conversation with many passersby before the building site, it became clear that some citizens believe that the performance of the city’s project will be much better, although few have the same questions on the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they start to resign because the city continues to delay these answers, it says from the BI.
As was heard, the mayor’s public statements also affect.
In May, at the municipal council meeting, he had said that he fears the outcome for the thermal pool, the population should vote against the plans for a bath and wellness complex in the Swiss manner when deciding the citizens.
Some appear to be just too scared, others feel it as a “plumbing extortion attempt” to the population, according to the BI press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick shell for Shiris: Mane no Schwalbenkönig
As satisfied with the current high shape of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, Ralf Rangnick, the sports director of the \"bullen\" was disappointed by the arbitrators.
“There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the Schwalbenkönige category,” he took refuge at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
Youngster occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, where Senegalese became an alleged actress to hang - which was by no means a show of the TV images.
“A crucifixive mistake,” said Rangnick, who described judge Harkam as “full of overwhelms.”
Harkam would also have contributed \"his part\" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grodig coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He defended his German countryman, saying, “I would have behaved like Roger Schmidt in every situation.”
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleague after the scarf.
I didn't know why.
“For I am the one who was insulted,” said the 46-year-old.
In view of the success run, however, Rangnick agreed to a praise Shymne.
“There are only two words for that: correct well,” he stated.
There's not much to put out.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go so far.
Frame changes in winter transfer time will hardly be possible.
There are no great reasons to change something.
“A player comes to the outside with the wish that he will leave the club,” Rangnick said.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's health law
It is a great victory for the Obama government: the U.S. Supreme Court decided today that the closely linked health law to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - it forces U.S. citizens to complete a health insurance or pay a penalty until 2014 - is constitutional in the context of the state’s tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts joined the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy, on the other hand, decided.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 page comprehensive law and also held the view that the provision of the health law, which states would have to extend either the access requirements for medicaid or otherwise violate all state medicaid funding, would not be constitutionally restrictive.
The lawsuit against the law was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place is made with giant mirrors of light
With huge mirrors, residents of a Norwegian village brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of solar damage, the rjukan located in the Vestfjord Valley, from autumn to spring, usually sinks in the shadows of the surrounding mountains.
With three giant reflectors in 45 meters of height, a century-old dream came true on Wednesday.
“Finally,” Mayor Steinar Bergsland swung at the start ceremony on TV2 broadcast.
Some of the inhabitants of the valley were looking for sun chairs, others set up sunglasses in safety.
So far, sun-hungry in winter had to ride a cable track to a nearby summit.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Anderson presented the proposal to turn the rays into the valley with mirrors.
This basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally approved the 5 million crowns (about €615 000) expensive project.
A similar construction has been carried out for several years at the Italian Alpine town of Viganella winter sunshine.
Posts hardly yet on Sundays
“Many citizens will not yet have noticed that the red points for the Sunday emptying are still at different briefcases of the core city and the towns, but read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find that the emptying of Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place,” the FDP says.
An FDP request confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only in front of the post building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be taught.
Whether it is taught in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sunday, the FDP's request will not be answered in response.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to hook up here.
Sunday emptying is an important postal service right at the time of appointment.
“In spite of the increase in the price of letters in January 2013, this company will be in a radical and unsuspectable manner,” he said.
Thomas Bittner, Group and City Council chairman of the Liberals, supports his groupmates: “What angers me is the fact that here emphasis is being changed or also deleted.
The post is miles away from the village.
“At least the briefcases in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten need to be taught again on Sunday, according to Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also valid for the core city, especially not mobile citizens, should be able to reach a briefcase with Sunday emptying.
Röhrenbeck asked in the City Parliament whether the city administration is planning talks with the post on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, also provided a Sunday emptying in Hofheim.
Your party has expressed itself for privateizations.
“Then decisions will be made elsewhere,” Maier said.
Frankfurter Parkfahrts are going to rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
The magistrate of the city today advises on a proposal by transport dezerent Stefan Majer (Green).
This means that parking costs are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, it is not intended to increase prices, but to shorten the time interval of parking watches and parking lights from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Council will have to decide.
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this “not a good idea”
The possibility of parking directly in front of the business is “an invaluable advantage for smaller retailers to be underestimated.”
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is “simply appropriate and actually long overdue.”
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Happy City: Fast Actions Overcrowding Hosts
With a narrow frame, Mr. I of the TSV pleasure city had to enter the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbische Alb.
The elders stood with an experienced team on the other side.
Soon, however, it was shown that they could not fully keep up with the rapid actions of the pleasure-cityrs, including age-related ones.
With the hard and placed storage, the Gönninger was extremely heavy.
Repeatedly, they missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz clean over the network center and were not on the scene during the block-off.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the pleasure-cityrs in all interests.
In view of this exhilarating and play-determining performance, the third sentence was then somewhat lazy and hopelessly won to the 3:0 end level (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There will be a much more powerful opponent in the field on November 2 with the TV Bayersbronn, which was able to get through in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Joy City were at the Murgtalhalle in Bayersbronn.
They delivered a hard-hitting two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused errors and points gifts especially in ball adoption; even in the passes, the precision was occasionally affluence and in some critical play scenes, the overlover prevented the view of possible score gains.
In this powerfully balanced meeting, however, Marcus Blasutto’s TSV team voted through the great physical commitment and enjoyable engagement of both teams.
Care Day at the Small England Hut
For the fifth day in the aftermath of the Natura 2000 project above Hotzenwald, a group of committed participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to popular encouragement this day should be cut free in the area of the cottage overlooking the valley, Mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many hikers referred to this area as the glistening piece of snow, on which the landscape offers the ideal framework for magnificent views.
He thanked the present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable tool to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
He offers every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, the ecological consideration can also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Department of Nature Protection of the Government of Freiburg following the welcome of Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the control of the screen and wished the action to be a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the wide view covers the goal of obtaining the growing old Allmendweid field with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You will need these free connections for the type-keeping process.
Tribukait said they don’t want to miss out on breaking a lance for the planned biosphere area.
In this plan, the current measures are not only seamless.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognized UNESCO status and thus a continuous addition to the life project and the past days of care for the future.
After these various performances, Revierführer Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the helpers in groups.
The larger trees had already been hit in the front, the forsslepper was optionally ready for call.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of water bushes and care for the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the free view at the point of view.
Löffingen: Köpfler is still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the city of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children’s, youth and senior policy, as well as its own urban works, can be referred to as an attractive city, no second mayoral candidate has yet been reported.
As the only candidate for the aftermath of the no longer candidate mayor Norbert Brugger for age-old reasons, the 46-year-old bank merchant and business manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has been established.
The application period runs on Monday, 11 November, at 18 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei accused of Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a lawsuit on Thursday for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company overtaken by Nortel during the insolvence increase.
Rockstar, the consortium that the Nortel patent purchased for $4.5 billion, accused Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies of patent violations in Texas.
Rockstar is located in the community property of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google will be charged in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents involve technology that match the search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the complaint that thus meets the core of Google’s search engine business.
Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar representatives were not immediately accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid worth $900 million for the Nortel patent.
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $4.4 billion.
After it was overrated by Rockstar’s Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $1.5 billion, a business that was also a part of Motorola’s library of patents.
“Although Google has failed with its attempt to acquire the patent in auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so,” the complaint said.
Rockstar is demanding a high compensation from Google, as it claims that Google’s patent infringement is deliberate, the charge said.
Egypt defends first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi is laying down the oath of office, but his day of triumph may not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was defended as the country’s first freely elected president and thus entered the succession of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With its introduction before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He laid down the oath before the 18 black robe-dressed judges of the court, who had his seat on the Nile and who was following an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” said Mursi at the solemn ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life, absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said the 60-year-old Mursi, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group who since its founding 84 years ago had been seen as a banned organization by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o'clock.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the court to cheer up the new president, and, unlike the presidential prunk of the Mubarak era, traffic was stopped only for a short time so that the car convoy could cross the commonly-inhabited road that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatical replacement wheel, Brotherhood has been mocking his personal prestige since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he not only presented himself as a candidate of Islamists, but all those who wanted to target the efforts of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state,” said Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie, the judge in the wood-burning chamber in which he held the office oath.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo where he was supposed to give his speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem that he listened to in a courtroom.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of attendees in the university’s largest listening hall with a voice hearing from “The Army and the People Are One Hand.”
The University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, developed into a high-burg Islamist student group in the 1970s.
On Friday Mursi placed a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the rebellion, which led to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubaraks last year, and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers that had been taken over by the military council from the head of state chased out of office.
But with the passing of the official oath before the court, and not as usual before Parliament, he opposes the will of the military, indicating that the struggle of power will continue.
Mursis speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg Discothek \"Blue Velvet\" has begun.
On Friday evening it is called \"Pump this party\" on the morning of Saturday evening it continues with a Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are, of course, promised by the organizers on both days.
Worker crashed from leader: seriously injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a leader and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heater at the outside facade of a guest house.
As he went up to the ladder on the roof, the man threw them away, and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter (Christophorus 6).
Rape in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life imprisonments on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim later died from the consequences of serious injuries.
John Kana was found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had caused abduction nationwide.
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial property in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The view of young people was so amazing that the caregivers and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the process to having been in a bar on the actual night with Booysen.
He also stood up to have them beaten and raped, but he objected to being responsible for the girl’s death.
The police had initially gone out of several murders, but released two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was not enough.
The prosecutor also emphasized during the proceedings that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
In South Africa, rapes are almost part of everyday life: there are approximately 64,000 ads each year due to sexual violence.
These are almost ten times as many as in Germany, but with 82 million people there are significantly more people than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa, however, estimate the dark figures in sexual violence at the 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the black forest ham
Jumbo looking for the “best ham in the world”: For TV broadcast “Galileo” visited the Pro7 star Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham is the pork claws, and turbomast is not a good condition.
Can ham that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli as head of the large shink factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the operation of the company “Adler” in Bonndorf.
\"Germany's favorite ham - as Jumbo announces the black forest ham.
Only with hair protection and kittel, he comes into the interior of the factory.
Jumbo also has to get his hands infected before he can get to the micro.
Jumbo to strengthen at Schnellimbiss in Waldshut face
“Here’s a huge amount of work to do — the television makers, blackwood hams as a mass product.
16,000 Colognes per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what it is about quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
TV with a level?
Details such as the ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
“I’m excited when you meet Roberto Blanco, what’s going on, so Jumbo is cynical.
Here, the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But watching is still worth it.
The viewer sees that the dismantling of the Colognes continues to work hand in hand.
For: Blackwood ham is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the mixture of spices with salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo optically of a “U-boat”
The trick: Tanning branches here in smoke provide the special taste of the black forest ham.
20 days in smoke make the ham almost black.
\"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo - he announces the test-feeding.
“It’s nice,” said the TV star.
This will allow all stakeholders to live.
Did you think travel agencies belong to the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its winning prospects for the entire year and expects record revenue from holidayers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now accounts for a cleansed annual profit before taxes between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are reached, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent of profits in the first half of the year and set a strong start to the second half of the year, particularly in the Australian and British private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries are profitable, and some of them are well in the direction of record annual revenue before interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest outcomes.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which balances a weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it ran well for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while also here the business customers spend less.
The U.S. business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit for the whole year is expected for the third year.
The shares of Flight Centre rose to $38.20 yesterday by 3 cents.
Schools are held at a greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will need to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic lyrics and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
In the test you will also find “unseen texts” input to encourage wider reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is cancelled.
As of 2015, students need to pass a separate GCSE test for language, with strong incentives for choosing English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curriculums for English and Mathematics tomorrow - the first subjects to be radically redesigned.
Other core branches will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Supervisory Authority for Tests, will announce a new organisation of the GCSE structures, including a new listing system and less course work.
In a speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there is a “wide consensus that we need to reform our test system to restore public confidence, stressing that the GCSEs would become more challenging, ambitious, and stricter.”
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics — 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year — than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours annually and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the hour plan, from coalition circles, it is said that the comprehensive math examination - combined with a stronger weighting of the expertise in rankings - will likely encourage schools to spend more hours.
In the curriculum, more attention is given to “problems from the right life,” including financial mathematics.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Conversation Forum
The next Ecumenical Conversation Forum on Monday, October 21, at the New Museum of the Castle, is about the subject “To Hell with Hell - Theological Consideration of Today’s Dealing with the Last Things.”
He is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Conversation Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Churches of Salem, the Castle of Salem and the Cultural Office of Lake Condo.
Johanna Rahner wants to look at the forum of the question of how people are starting the “last things” after death today.
In the past centuries, people have known too much about it, putting on those images of heaven and hell, which, to this day, shape our imaginations, so the contemporary prophetic teaching of hopes of perfection is more likely to be expressed by some embarrassment or even speechlessness.
“The greater hope is Christian women and Christians driven by religious criticism,” said the referee.
“They have provided us with so many questions that we seem to have come off the call sign.”
Johanna Rahner continues: “The crucial challenge remains the problem of death.”
This is the question of that desire, which dreams that in the end all things may be good.
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She promoted to Dr. theol., also in Freiburg in 1997.
The Habilitation of Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a chair for Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at Kassel University.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Little Heuberg confirm their faith in the firming of their faith
In two religious services, 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the soul care unit Am Kleinen Heuberg were established.
In the morning, the group Laudato-Si, accompanied by the youth choir The Spirit, accompanied by the church of Laudato-Si.
With the reception of the Firm Sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and invented the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, the companies, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the assistance of numerous community members, had been preparing for the big festival.
In various projects, they met various tasks of Christian community life and together they experienced the youth day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race exciting participants
With amazing weather, 214 cyclists arrived at Illmensee to manage the round course across the hill chains around the lake.
This was announced by Ulrich Knobel of the Illmensee Sports Association.
Among the participants were, in particular, on the short distance of more than 15 kilometers and 300 meters, also numerous men's cyclists who once wanted to practice their hobby in competition atmospheres.
Two juniors of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German Championships.
Both of them were expected to move from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small amount of time to the goal and defend his title as the overall winner of the short-term.
In the second place, Pascal Treubel was able to place himself again.
With the ladies, theresa Dueli was from the team nightmare, which created it on top of the winning staircase.
Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie Sanders from Owingen.
An enjoyable development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years in the younger to more than 70 years in the older starters.
In the main race this year, there were even more absolute topatletes at the start.
Four drivers were able to get away from the regional top drivers.
Under Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half professional from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl, along with a teammate, has been a world champion twice in the twelve-hour drive.
This year he became a European champion in this special discipline.
With it also Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German master titles in the Duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of height, it came to a winding final in the finish line before the three-sea hall.
Pangerl was the first to race across the line.
Only one second after that, the Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall score.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the goal as the third of the overall score.
In the women's score, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the lead race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured the second place before Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sporters and helpers showed themselves very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
Along the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the \"CNN Heroes of 2013\"
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as the CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle saw his sick father again and again lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain and there caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” Georges Bwelle said.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
“It’s not easy, Bwelle comments.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has changed little since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
However, even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonites could not afford to visit them.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of health expenses in the country are private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffer to see Bwelle’s decision to do something against it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vessel surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels in rural areas on weekends offering free medical care.
Since 2008 he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people forced himself into small buses and drove the torn medical equipment on the roof over unfixed terrain into the villages that need help.
Not everything is always smooth.
More than once, they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle, with his broad smile and his limitless energy, is happy to be present at the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team will begin examining hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per trip, according to Bwelle.
They come from a circuit of 60 kilometers around the village - and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive cribs, donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document needed for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local deception.
The operations usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the intervention, the patients stand up and go into the recreation area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is eaten by the generator of the group and thus Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It's a tough pensum, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group — a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students — has performed 700 free operations last year and knows that it is making a huge difference with their work for the people they help.
One man explained that the free operation of a performance break he received now enabled him to work again.
“This is changing the future of my family,” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as surgeon at the hospital, Bwelle also works at private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he funded 60% of his nonprofit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest came from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteered to work in Bwell’s group.
He is either in the hospital or is trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and medical students like O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to collect practical experiences they would never get at home.
“We can be in operations where we help to drop blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated sanitation material.
However, they are only once in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transportation and guidance.
“He’s no doubt a hero,” O’Malley says.
He devoted his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people do not know any limits.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life and thus fulfill a promise he has given to his father makes him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to bring people back to laughter and to relieve the pain.

the Battle of the Battle
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingways Novelle — The Old Man and the Sea — is cut on the body by Horst Janson.
Janson is himself an old hare in his metier, the art of acting.
The old man Santiago can't have anything to do with fishing.
That's how the two simply complement themselves great.
It is almost believed that the folds in the neck of the old man, the fisherman Manolo, can be seen.
If Santiago is tired of life sitting on the chair, this is true of Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who did not give up and ultimately won the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his willpower.
Janson is on stage as a single performer.
He manages to focus the audience’s attention on himself, so that his monologues are not momentary.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is only made of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann allows the old man to act in front of the fishing village in the boat.
Over the course of the performance, he lightes the respective active scene: the cottage of Santiago, the bar of singer Marie-Luise, who sings the life-sustaining spirit of Cuba with her songs and her magnificent voice.
The four musicians play Cuba’s rhythm for this and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Tourism: Departing to the Romans
At about 120 meters in length, a wastewater channel from the Roman period has been obtained below Cologne.
Those who visit Cologne don't go to the dome.
Around 157 meters, the two towers run into the sky and make it the second-highest church building in Europe.
However, few visitors who marveled at the two filigran church towers, feeling that there is also a lot to discover under the dome.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the field of Cologne Underworld.
Meeting point for his tours is the service center of Cologne Tourism directly at the Dom.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: “We start in the deep garage,” says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore, from the remains of the old city walls, only that was not too big.
For this reason, most of the users of the parking lot are also rushing past the Roman remains today and are just putting off their car.
But who looks more closely, in the D2 park deck, discovers an archaeological site separated by metal grid rods.
It can be seen about five meters high ruins made of hand-teller-sized stones.
“There are remnants of the Roman city walls that were built in the second half of the first century after Christ,” Schulze says.
Before it goes back to daylight, the participants at the upper park level let them take a look into a windowy, 15-foot- deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old dome, which is unfortunately hardly perceived.
The next station of the round is the Pretorium, and here the participants get back to the depth.
Here we experience the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Pretor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
\"The abbreviation stands for \"Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium - which in good German means as much as \"City of Roman law and city of the Agrippinenses, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the emperor's cult - means -
And the Pretorium is the former Instead of the Palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front room of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman wastewater channel, which is obtained here at about 120 meters in length.
“You can quietly walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want,” Schulze tells the guests.
A surprise has to be found.
After getting the key at the cash box, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, walkable shaft.
“We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath,” he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the water that was essential for the ritual washings.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read through changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall site for which the construction work is to begin in the near future.
Until the end, however, a few more years will pass.
Bein almost hacked: Reposition of Rocker Process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment will be rerolled after over four years.
A trial for attempted murder, dangerous body injury and damage to two 30-year-olds has begun in front of the Frankfurt District Court (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants swivel to wake up.
They were to be active in the rock scene and at the time were among the bandidos.
In June 2009, the prosecutor accused them of having hit and hit three men in a car together with unknown complicity in Finowfurt.
All the victims were severely injured, a man had almost lost his leg.
Victims are supposed to have been part of the competing group of Hells Angels.
One should have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Before that, it seems that there was a pursuit of several cars.
According to the charge, it was about cross-border battles and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were released in a first procedure in early 2012.
A court spokesman said it could not be proved that the men had actually been involved in the bloody fever.
The perpetrators wore masks and were not recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice upheld the ruling after revision of the prosecutorship and referred it back to the Land Court for remanding.
One of the defendants is currently in the open execution due to another offence.
It was primarily about the reconstruction of the processes during the fact-night period.
As a witness, the commissioner was charged at the time.
In the center were cell phone conversations of the defendants and other persons who had stopped the police.
It’s hard to believe that rockers in court are almost always in favor of an earlier law, and don’t say it.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had been unpacked.
Attorney Stefan Golfier of Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that new traces have been revealed since the last trial.
For the process, 11 additional negotiating days have been set up.
The Disturbing Society does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it was going home.
Only: in the books of the people on the sidecar and back seat, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Clearly, for this one may be responsible for some cocktail or sect!
What’s closer than going to the next drive-in to give yourself a little bit?
I’m happy to be there when it comes to fast food Holen late night or early morning.
A couple of pommes, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like going home and going to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco walkers make notice.
Because what does a lack of regularity require you to throw your fast food bags out of the car window?!
Especially on weekends are discarded paper bags on street edges and on parking lots.
“Why,” I wonder.
Are the people too deaf to take the bags with them at home and up to the next garbage bucket?
It's not just that the paper witness is snuffing the landscape.
Bags have also already covered transport facilities such as a guide plank and thus caused accidents.
As to what is thought to be, “weighing society,” but not according to it, she probably doesn’t even know what this word really means.
When you're on the way more often in the evening, just right with several people in the car, you know what a back bench can look like after night-long nights: clamots, bottles, and other trash towers.
There would be a few bags more or less, unlike the street, where no one wants to rumble on the food remains of others.
I’m already seeing the day when cities and communities will be bleeding the wayspace - and the fast food chains for their bags have to demand Pfand.
Obama's Retirement in Health Policy
After intense criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday with his often repeated, clear promise: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of their defendants received a letter of termination, the Republicans accused the president in recent days of misbehaving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama made his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them,” he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the announcements, Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look into the free market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or more favorable than forecasted.
“They come a better offer,” he said.
The government referred to it as a little surprising that the five percent of the people who have even completed insurance had to look at another tariff, as their contract did not meet the new standards according to the Affordable Care Act.
“I want to tell these Americans directly: you deserve betters,” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House of Representatives’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
“I’m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement of a imposed Sebelius to a councillor sitting behind her at the yesterday hearing in the House of Representatives was recorded after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri, and it was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly questioned why the Affordable Care Act’s Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily renounce a state-funded insurance to complete a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which they now want to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Forces Airport
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous on Thursday told the U.S. news station CNN that Israeli fighters had attacked an air force terminal in Syrian Latakia a day earlier.
The aim was to have been “ rockets and related equipment” that the Israeli government feared were intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia was shot on Thursday night, and the Israelis were responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latakia, where Russian defence missiles of Type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles were seen, which channel 2 according to have a range of 35 kilometers and can transport explosives up to 70 kilograms.
The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believes Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesperson for the Israeli Ministry of Defense said, “We don’t comment on these reports.”
In the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized that the Syrian regime had previously, in part, tried to deliver ground-air missiles to Hisbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant crossing a “red line” that would follow a military response.
John Kerry, in an unprecedented instance, explains that the US spy has gone too far.
John Kerry, with an unexpected response, pointed out that the U.S.'s defensive attitude toward their surveillance programs, by saying that the espionage has gone too far in certain cases.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama, held responsibility for having switched to Autopilot when the explosive revelations of the whistleblower Edward Snowden were revealed about NSA’s espionage activities.
By means of the continued information, the U.S. government has been driven into a diplomatic storm of dismantling on the part of its allies.
In a video connection speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “The president and I, as well as others in the government, have learned of some things that have passed almost by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so is what goes back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and of course to the 11th of September.
He then stood as the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to say that the U.S. spy had crossed a border, but also emphasized that no rights had been abused.
He said, “In some cases, the inappropriate has gone too far.”
The President is determined to create clarity, and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be affected.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA be a force of good and that many lives have been saved through their monitoring operations.
He added: “We have to deal with a new world in which people are ready to blow themselves into the air.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is motivated to kill people, to blow into the air, and to attack governments.
So what if you were able to get rid of it and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will travel to Europe to crush the concerns against the alleged American espionage and convince the Europeans of the need to continue working with the U.S. in anti-terror efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs declared on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned because of their threats of not participating in anti-terror organizations because of the frustration over monitoring by the National Security Agency.
“It is very important for the U.S. national security interests to keep Europeans on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism,” said Murphy, who sits in the Senate as a Democrat for the first time and serves as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the terrorist fight, regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes.
Media reports, according to which the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe, have burdened relationships with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence service declared this week that the reports were inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents released by Snowden, after which the NSA monitored the mobile phone of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the National Secret Services, James Clapper, defended the espionage among allies as necessary and explained that it was common on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said his authority was preparing the journey of Congress to take place this year, hoping the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating MPs are to be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the journey was to improve relationships, he also said that there would be some “severe words.”
He said European governments must be honest about the type of espionage programs they have been using for years.
“Two, we can change our surveillance programs and thus better protect European rights, but they also have to deal with the fact that we are not the only ones who spy,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, for John Kerry on weekends, a trip to the Middle East and to Poland will take place there with the Groll on the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the U.S. surveillance activities.
A stubborn injury at the jump joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the FSV Mainz 05 Bundesliga out-game at FC Augsburg.
It was built by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he was only able to do that individually.
“We will decide on its application in the short term,” said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goal protections with six hits.
Because the mainzers already have to reject the injured performance carriers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australians are calling for prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket because she falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, filed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 to have made a false statement after she had told Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the mornings on Sunday, June 10, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they stood up to having the story designed.
Until the trial, she was on-site in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention facility on the outskirts of Phukets, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney’s Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about his daughter’s well-being and wanted her back to Australia.
“We are naturally very worried, but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the ruling and is against a deposit of 50,000 baht on free foot.
In Australian reports, it was read that in the meantime, she vacationed in the resort of Krabi in South Thailand.
From the court's side, it was heard that Bamford will be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and have been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in a adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand might be trying to improve its attacked tourist image after the recent assassination of travel merchant Michelle Smith in Phuket, which is why it comes to freedom.
