Fire in French chemical plant deleted
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen was removed. This was announced to the Normandy Prefecture on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night. No one was injured in the incident. The firearm was in use with about 200 extinguishers.
The fire could be kept.
Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. The plant is located on the banks of the Seveso, which is the company of Lubrizol of U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett, and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which lays down particularly strict security charges.
About 400 people are working at the plant. The chemical factory has already provided headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 a leak detonated the gas methane and the environment was widely smoked by lazy eggs. In 2015, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil was added to the city's wastewater system after an operational accident.
Woman announces her job to seek 57 days after her missing female
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and announced her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie was removed from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days were missing from the female of every track - but Carole King did not give up.
“It was terrible. I got sick,” said Carole King to the Daily Inter Lake, and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had a dog put in panic
In hopes that Katie could stop somewhere else at the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. “The employee says: “She left about four and a half hours ago,” Carole King remembers to “Daily Inter Lake” when the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately out.
“I have never lost hope,” Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake, who announced her job as a postman in order to continue her search for Katie.
\"The Tears Sweater\"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King received a call: A man reported to himself and said that Katie was in his court. But when the king arrived, Katie had already disappeared. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly stood her female under a tree. “I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go,” King recalled, “Daily Inter Lake” “The tears were tied. The people stopped in their cars, got out and embraced us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found them.
Losses in the Federal Armed Forces: Machine guns disappear unscathed
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six machine guns of type MG3 are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, the opposition is unclear.
Since the beginning of 2014, the army has reported the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons, and almost 20,000 shots of ammunition. This is from a list of the Federal Defence Ministry which the German editorial network reports.
According to the paper from the Office of Secretary of Defense Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, a part of weapons and 3474 shots of ammunition have been recovered. Among other things, six machine guns of type MG3, eleven guns of type G3, four guns of type G36, six signal guns as well as two guns of type P8. There are also 30 guns missing for machine guns of type MG3.
The extent of gun and ammunition losses in the federal army was “frightening” the left-country minister Martina Renner, who said that in the course of the investigation, nothing was found. The left-wing politician spoke of a “thorough balance sheet” racer who was criticized on the list was not aware of whether or not the one found under the disappeared ammunition was also the one found in connection with the investigation against the terror-prone federal army officer Franco A. “And this although a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of possession of this ammunition,” Renner said.
Oil tanker - Stena Impero - left Iranian port
More than two months after its determination by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker Stena Impero left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitive showed, the tanker was moving and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was designated in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but he remained in Iranian waters for the first time.
The \"Stena Impero\" was imposed by the Iranian Revolution Guards in Hormuz' Sea Road on July 19 under the provocation to have violated security regulations, but Iran was suspected of responding to the controversial, temporary determination of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the Gibraltar belonging to the UK.
Hormuz Street is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil exports is shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region have been tremendously sharpened over the past few months. The trade shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the United States and Iran.
Merkel appreciates the courage of people in the Peaceful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel honored the commitment of the people in the GDR, who went to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, brave citizens had turned the DDR regime into whacking, Merkel said at a feast of the Thuringian CDU Group on the upcoming day of the German Unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor recalled, among other things, the occupation of the Stasi Center.
Musk pursues extradition record
Tesla’s quarter may hold record. Despite delivery boom, there were last losses at the electric car group.
New York.Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given its electric car company with the prospect of new record numbers a tremendous boost on the stock market. “We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
The demand was strong, so Tesla was able to make 110,000 orders, it was called roundwriting in Musks. The challenge was to bring the cars to the customer soon, and to this end Tesla had to provide as many resources as possible for the quarter end.
Investors liked that: Tesla’s shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. The price has been out of stock for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well over 95000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be set in the current and next quarter of the year. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is requested, but here are the winning teams low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Puzzle solved: That's why we can't kick ourselves.
A kind of brake in the large brain prevents people from kicking on their own. This was found by scientists at the State University in Berlin with the help of experiments to rats, how they reported on Thursday evening, and progress in the question of why children resisted the puzzle to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why only the nearness of a kicking hand has already caused laughter before the touch. This lies on a deep layer in the large brain, which has already caused laughter in the event of expectation.
According to the data, earlier research has shown that rats with \"laughs\" react in the ultrasonic region when they are bitten by humans. This \"laughs\" is given through the part of the large brain, which is the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-infliction
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self touch and touch by others - that is, people cannot kiss themselves. However, the Berlin researchers have found in the experiments at the rats that laughter as well as the activity of the affected area of the large brains are suppressed during a self-infliction. This is also true when living beings themselves are laid down. During the strange touch and the puzzle by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and the impulse has been strengthened.
Pass the self touch and touch by others at the same time, however, if laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the brain of the rat is not able to distinguish between the self touch and the touch by others. The new findings suggest that people cannot kiss themselves because the self touch activates a brake in the large brain.
The rats were also trained to bite themselves, and in the experiment they broke this initiative, sometimes in an early stage, showed abject behavior or fear. This ambivalence was similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of the cat is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster destroyed: Large fire in French chemical plant deleted
The big fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is particularly dangerous, was deleted. This was announced by the Normandy Prefecture of the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night.
The samples taken give no reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was injured in the incident. The firefighter was in use with about 200 extinguishers.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called on not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to the company Lubrizol from US billionaire Warren Buffett
The plant is part of the company Lubrizol of U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso EU directive, which specifically prescribes strict security charges.
The chemical factory has already provided headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 a leak of the gas from Methanethiol and a wide range of the surrounding area was removed by lazy eggs. In 2015, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil was transferred into the city's wastewater system after a business accident.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by her own sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at the first meeting in Parliament after the forced break was canceled on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to run the country on 31 October without an agreement from the EU, Brussels should not rely on its demands for changes to the Brexit Agreement.
Regarding Cox, who had committed himself to staying in the UK in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: “The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and the country again would be to carry out the EU exit — Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist in 2016 during the referendum campaign.
Moments of attacks by Oslo and Utöya are revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday in honor of the victims. The monument \"Jernrosene\" (German: the Iron Roses) is made up of about 1,000 billion billion roses. It reminds of the roses that thousands of people had laid off in the days and weeks after the attacks before the dome in Oslo.
At the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be unveiled - the roses have been mutilated by people from all over the world, including survivors and victims. The opening will include Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
The right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had first fired a car bomb in Oslo’s government district on 22 July 2011 and, in response to the Utöya island, killed dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers’ Party.
Iran Releases British Tanker
The UN-General debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict, but there is now less problem. The British oil tanker Stena Impero in Iran could be in the sea again. It could be a piece of puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker, Stena Impero, has been back in international waters since mid-July in the streets of Hormus in Iran. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the ferry company Stena Bulk reported.
The “Stena Impero” has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew are now driving to Dubai for medical investigations, said shipping chief Erik Hånell. By noon the ship had left the Iranian waters. “Beautiful that it is over,” he said to Swedish television station SVT.
\"This is part of a pattern of attempts to influence the freedom of the seas. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law - it was in a statement on Friday.
On 19 July, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards had ordered the tankers to ignore the regulations of sea law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members were in line with the circumstances, Hånell said. They had been working professionally with their families as soon as possible in view of the difficult and uplifting situation in the last ten weeks.
The British government suspected behind the determination of the Stena Impero, a response to a similar incident in British Gibraltar: in early July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was intended for Syria, was put to the chain.
In mid-August, the \"Adrian Darya-1\" was finally released. Opinions that it was about a exchange business to get rid of the \"Stena Empire\" that London vehemently returned.
Hormus Street is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the world's oil exports are shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region have been tremendously sharpened in recent months. The trade shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the United States and Iran.
After the tensions between Tehran and Washington, the nuclear conflict between both countries is under way. The Americans are calling for the Iranian leadership to build nuclear weapons. Iran is back. The United States was out of the international nuclear agreement in 2018, which should prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the U.S. government has been putting pressure on Tehran’s leadership with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a stricter and more advanced agreement.
Because of the dispute over the Stena Impero and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for military protection of the trade ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani has presented a plan for security and peace in the streets of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the initiative “Coalition of Hope” for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign forces, wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined as a war winner, given the criminal duties imposed by US President Donald Trump against Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to redispose. Financial chiefs of Asian companies considering to move their production from China to another country call India in a survey of UBS as one of the preferred alternatives, which has not only to do with the inevitability of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pool to young labour market and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be creating a more important role in the global production chain.
But now that India has become the focus of Trump’s focus, from the Haudegen in the White House devalued as the “kingdom of customs,” America has withdrawn trade benefits for 2000 products in early June. The United States claims India is subject to proactively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the frictions with India are just a side scene. In addition, the world's largest democracy is also seen by the security-political glasses. Delhi and Washington are linked to the concerns about China's claims of power in the South Indian Ocean. In view of this, a salve of U.S. criminal duties against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term, must therefore weigh himself safely.
The problem lies elsewhere: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a heavy standing in the socialist Republic of India. Also under Modi. Its reformers focus mainly on the bureaucracy of error that suffocated in the multi-people state all too long every business spirit. Companies now receive faster construction permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more gripping insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for them to more quickly liquidate companies with high debt.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic perspective, in India, much more has been achieved in the first five modes of the year, but this is not true in trade policy.
In the West, Modi depends on the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, whose country is economically radically renewed. This impression is not least due to the fact that the Charismatic Prime Minister knows only too well which democratic Western managers like. At the core, however, the “India First” Advocat never deviated from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to rid themselves of anachronistic processes and thus fit for global competition. Business people who survive through the shooting of their industries are among the chief voters of Motis nationalist Bharatiyaataata Party and complain about this short-sighted policy.
Besieging Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac was to be held a report next week in Paris. The former head of state will be installed on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP, calling on the Chiracs family, will be in the close family circle. For Sunday a public mourning celebration in Paris's disability was set up, as media reports reported.
To target the competitor: Dabo is the first secret hero of the Athletics World Cup
The world peak had long been in the goal when the submerged Khalifa International Stadium was playing its warming scenes. In the first advance of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby started to swing out of Aruba. He could hardly hold himself on the legs about 300 meters before the goal, ran in an unsanitary position when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country Guinea-Bissau suddenly grabbed him and pulled the last half of the stadium round into the target. The forces were still at both but to stop the running armband watch after the round. As if the scene had not been kurios enough.
“I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same,” Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he was completely unexpected drawing the attention of the gathered journalists. The shy ones he was only out of the way, did not want to talk about his heroate. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he just wanted to help a sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited by the World Cup. Under normal circumstances, he could not have even started. “That is why I am proud to walk here for my country,” he said.
This he did in the evening with emphasis - and much more intense than he had thought. Because this heroat will remain in mind. For example, Dabo even left his competitor Busby to take the lead and voluntarily took the last place - at least five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. It had nothing to do with it at the end, because the busby only with much help was disqualified at the end of the World Light Athletic Association.
At the same time, Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, arrived to set up a personal best-time at the World Cup in Doha, although he himself was disappointed by the official data at 18:10.87 minutes: “I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes, I had already been — but only in training, there are no best-times.
Millions of Masch: Egyptians are preparing for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in the face of possible government-critical protests. In the centre of Cairo, an increased police presence was to be observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed.
Even in recent days, police have strengthened their road controls and partially searched the mobile phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds were arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Enemies of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, the government of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi had been facing protests with hundreds of participants in protest against the political leadership of Egypt for years. The Spanish exile Egyptian construction contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who had played the demonstrations with video broadcasts on Facebook, has called for a “million march” in central places in the country for today’s Friday. Ali calls for a “people’s revolution,” although the man is not a “guest” for most young Egyptians, because he is a contractor for the army’s millions, but his messages arrive.
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECSR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests.
Willing arrests
Many people have been \"willfully arrested\" only because they were \"in the wrong place at the wrong time\" and have been told by HRW, calling for lawyers to be arrested. The allegations against the arrests range from \"dispersal of false information\" to membership in a \"terrorist association\" in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities surveyed and searched security forces in uniform, but also in civil clothing, according to HRW statements, as well as arbitrary passersby.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country. Therefore, the government blocks sites and online services in Cairo to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online dealers: Shipping dealers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online traders, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns land on the garbage. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online traders such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate back-to-back products instead of destroying them.
While it is not possible for companies to be exempt from sales tax on donations, the Ministry declared a question of the Green Country Day Group, which the Funke Media Group newspaper reported on Friday. However, traders could lower the market value of the unsaled returns so low that they would not have to pay any or little sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had found that in order to order on the Internet, the federal citizens returned every sixth package. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in trash. They would also cost the companies additional money according to current legal situation, because the financial authorities evaluate donations as a turnover that then affects sales tax.
Green Group CEO Katrin Göring-Eckardt urged finance minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with an permission that companies can not assess commercial products accordingly and donate freely to non-profit organizations. The companies had to rely on not to be punished for donation. This applies not only to online trading, but also to other businesses from fashion shops to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There never was a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, Devolved Parliament, is to be expanded soon.
For Branczik, Banksys's work — the restitution of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitudes of animals and tribes — is to be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital on Saturday, until it is to be enlarged on 3 October. It is estimated to be 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at Bristol Museum in the Southwestern United Kingdom, where Banksy lives. In this year, the artist had again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion, the work, which used to be called \"Fragrated\" was renamed \"Devolved Parliament\" (Delegated Parliament)
The picture could change the owner for a million.
Finally, on Wednesday at the first meeting of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, after a forced break by the Supreme Court imposed by the Supreme Court, made a tough exchange with the opposition, and Johnson wants to carry out the Brexit that has already been postponed twice on 31 October, even without any agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, interferes with the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture that depicts a man who with a meist breaks a star of the European flag. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day when entering the UK.
Brexit debate is like a ‘space in the park’
The fierce verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred in the face of the Brexit election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy in the park - Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation.
In the past few days, Johnson had severely attacked Brexit opponents in parliament and accused them, among other things, of \"dealing\" to the people.
Cummings said that the only way to get back to rest was to finally respect the British’s decision to leave the EU, and it was not surprising that people were told that the UK had not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the uplifting mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. “We should speak with respect,” it said in a statement. “And we should listen too.”
Pakistan Prime Minister Khan calls for Uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister, Imran Khan, once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in its first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely to occur, Khan said on Friday at the Uno-General debate in New York. “If this is going badly, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst, the United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir.
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them to the shared region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each rule part of Kashmir, another part of China. In early August, India had withdrawn independence status from the Indian Kashmir region, thus raising tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water.
The protesters in Cairo are demanding the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
In response to the current protests in Egypt, the government will be able to shoot more than 2,000 prisoners in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in there. Protesting has never been impossible in Egypt. However, since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything possible to avoid a scenario like the Arab Spring.
However, one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, perspectivelessness and the feeling of being stabbed by the government of its own, drove millions to the street. And that is a problem that the El-Sisi regime also fails to deal with, no matter how hard it is against resisters.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the rate of inflation is 10 percent. Those who want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who will finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the largest economic actor. The military is building roads, houses, football stages, food and much more. This has been the case before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, including the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically it will always be when large parts of the population have difficulty affording themselves a bottle of water at all times.
Tüv Tests at the Terminal: BER-Chef: No 'Showstopper' - More for Capital Airport
Two months have been checked to see if the complex plant flow at BER-Brandschutz works together. The operators are satisfied with the course. However, the Tüv is not yet complete at BER.
After large-scale Tüv investigations at the terminal of the future capital agency, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year, which is certain, said Supervisory Board Chief Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Control Board.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed exam, but also said it was still inadequate to finish in the terminal. “We have many detail topics, but we don’t have a real show stopper — He assured that the schedule was still buffered until the commission was launched.
However, there is evidence that the temporary reserve is no longer likely to be too large. The construction display is now scheduled to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year that was intended for this autumn.
Hundreds of shortcomings in power cables are still to be resolved; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. \"To create the conditions for the flight operation here, we must continue to work intensively on the handling of the shortcomings - it was in a written notice.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there are missing proofs, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the doubles on which the cable tracks hang. The airport chief expects this to be by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal still does not work satisfactoryly. The problems the project had led to a further crisis three years ago. This time it was about smoke cuts that run down in a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They drive down too far. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then there will be new attempts with hot gas smoke in the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree angels as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should go into operation in 2011. The cost has increased from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros since the start of 2006 to the opening next year.
Because passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, the controllers are planning to expand the airport, which is why it is expected to go to a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on October 18, as the Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managers. Finance chief Heike Fölster will switch to the German Railway at the end of the year, staff chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen will go to pension next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster.
Chemnitz: Automatically Blowed for Drugs - Police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and chased several automatics into the air in the Chemnitz city area for this purpose! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
Over the past two years, the number of blasted cigarette and parking lights cars in Chemnitz and the region has increased greatly.
After two detonations at the end of May, police held a 33-year-old German on the Civil Road and on Further Street in Chemnitz.
Police spokesperson Andrzej Rydzik: “In the course of the investigation of explosive explosions in fact unit with a particularly severe case of theft led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only confirmed this suspicion against the 33-year-old.
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now has a total of eight acts.
The police spokesperson: “With the prey, he has apparently funded his drug addiction - only four times, between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019, the bomber had blown a parking lot on the Civil Road.
The total damage caused is at least 60 000 euros!
The automatic bomber is now in charge, and the police investigation against him continues.
It is also possible that he was responsible for further automatic locks in Chemnitz and adjacent counties.
AUA takes over Eurowings-Anhalt from Vienna
In the midst of the price struggle with low-cost airliners such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA — the commercial control of all Eurowings countries from Vienna — confirmed on Friday a press spokesman for the Austrian Airlines to the APA.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa-Billigflieger Eurowings is thus de factoly dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four will remain in Vienna. The AUA will take over from January 2020 in the “Wetlease” including Eurowings staff. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations. The routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA Turn Cross and network planning, the speaker said. The flight times are to be agreed on connecting flights. The objective is to strengthen the Vienna Turn Cross and, on the other hand, to expand the decentralized traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, the Eurowings in Vienna will only serve as a “Production Company” for the group-sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. The board product will be adapted to those of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants will come from Eurowings. The Eurowings available under AUA flight number will no longer be completed in Terminal 1, but as the AUA will be done in Terminal 3.
On Thursday, Ryanair’s daughter Laudamotion announced the fleet in Vienna next summer on 16 aircraft. The Irish airliner sends four Ryanair machines, including crews to Vienna, also in the so-called “wetlease” that the union has been criticized as a conversion construct to the collective contract.
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary said that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, saying on Friday, “We will remain the number one in the location, in five, six or ten years.”

However, it is certain that the acquisition of the number nine of the British throne order and the real estate mogul will be a similar big celebration to the marriage of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Diseases
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what causes a heart weakness or infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the heritage of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
About the analysis of the heritage of 9,000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to get more detailed on the track of the causes of cardiovascular disease.
The research project was the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation promotes the project with EUR12.5 million. From Switzerland, the Davos High Mountain Hospital, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital of Zurich is involved.
Overweight, smoking, and unhealthy nutrition are among the essential risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. The interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficient, it was known. Now, scientists want to compare the full heritage of 8,000 healthy people with the UKE’s 1000 former patients.
At present, in more than 4,000 of the about 20,000 relevant human genes, there are possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - it was called the clinic.
The goal of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attacks. The data could also be used in researching other people’s diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, Head of the University of Heart and Vessel Center. New insights on the interaction between the heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancers are possible.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized the firm will to use the data for researching other diseases. The Foundation’s clinic in Davos has so far dealt with allergies. Now, on the medical campus there, a Center for Cervicular Precision Medicine is being created and a professor of bioinformatics is being created. In order to establish his commitment, the logistics contractor living in Switzerland said that he had been operating at the heart of Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The bioprobes of healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the Hamburg City Health Study. According to the clinic, 45,000 professionals are the largest local health study in the world. In the case of the heritage encryption, strict attention is paid to the protection of anonymised data, scientists assure it is a petabyte (1000 Terabyte) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital of Zurich.
According to UKE, the inheritance of a human being can now be decrypted within 24 hours. The pure cost of this is € 1300. The first gene sequence worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million. The study is expected to begin on October 1, already in late 2020, all 9,000 samples are to be analyzed. The first results are expected in the year following.
Nigerian police release hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, police released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Qur’an school. According to residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the minor victims, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo reported. “The victims were abused. Some of them reported being raped by their teachers,” Sabo said.
In fact, the guardians were held by their teachers under “the most deplorable and inhumane conditions,” said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children at the age of nine, were chained in a small room.
According to the Qur'an, the Qur'an school has been the subject of information for about ten years. Residents would have noticed repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents had been shocked when they were taught about the conditions in Qur'an school, Sabo said they had not been aware of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In most Muslim northern Nigeria there are many private Qur’an schools. They replace the often lacking state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed gangs. According to the UN refugee aid plant, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border in the neighbouring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police free 400 children from school
\"Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries pointing to torture,\" said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children were discovered on Thursday after an indication in an Islamic school, and the conditions there were “humanely unworthy.” The officials arrested the school principal and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held at their school as slaves and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television shows showed destitute and injured students in a clearly poor state of health.
World footballer's choice: Further allegations after Messis and Klopp's Kür
Football - Significance not valid -
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, the World Football Association Fifa is the best player, best player and best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the World Football Election, accusations came from other countries to the Fifa. Egypt was not worth it - with a Kuriosian reason.
In the past few years, many things in the Fifa have turned out to be bad news: the World Cups, dubiose plans of their President Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of a variety of corrupt officials. The Fifa World Cup election has so far not been in the suspicion of going off inconceivably - if one can see that the voting national coaches and national team captains of member associations often vote more for sympathy than for objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already accused him of not agreeing at all, further disagreements are now taking place: Egypt accuses that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account.
The Fifa apologizes to the fact that “the signatures on the electoral forms in major letters and therefore not valid” have been issued. The Egyptian association has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan's coach is also amazed
While the situation is understandable in the case of Egypt, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not agree as it was then worth it: with Lionel Messi on place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, however, the vote went the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
There were also charges made by Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera: \"Don't vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my voice is false, thank you,\" he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association simply agreed on his behalf.
The association now came to the news on Friday: Voiced, but of course was no intention. The full electoral documents were \"irritable - with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was in a statement of the association. However, elected by the second captain Manuel Rosas. \"We assume responsibility for the administrative error - it was in the communication. However, both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, \"all the way it is in the official list of FIFA -
The other cases now allow Fifa to check in an investigation, but stress that the election was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Football Championship and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine Affairs: Ranghigh Republicans speak out for official investigation
“I think the investigation is important,” said the Republican governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. “Where it comes from, it is determined by the facts that are being found — he wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking action.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly invited Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone call to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
So far, the Republicans have held back criticism of Trump because of the whistleblower affair, and few have been disappointed. Scott’s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party, and the moderate governor of Virginia has repeatedly opposed Trump’s policies, such as the locking of environmental regulations and the strengthening of immigration regulations.
“It’s a deeply disturbing situation,” Baker said, “the right way and the responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and go to the ground.”
Scott and Baker, U.S. Governor of the United States, have not formally co-communicated against Trump, which will be decided in Congress. Their statements are, therefore, particularly symbolically important. However, even first senators of the Republicans have been critical of the situation.
The affair could have been sparked in the introduction of an official meeting against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into this, and they charge him with abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on an actual term of office fell in the Senate where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are small, so far no U.S. president has been dismissed by an impeachment trial of the office.
Was there torturers on the board of Racketes — Sea Watch?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they are to have been raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had uninvited the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship Sea Watch 3 and 53 Libyan refugees. After fierce protests and international criticism, including Austrian President Alexander van der Bellen, her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
New heavy charges are now being made against Rackete. Three men who have been tortured in Libyan refugee camps with the \"Sea-Watch 3\" could have arrived in Italy. The suspects were arrested in a camp in Messina, Sicily, after migrants had recognised their tormentors in Italy. “We can’t exclude this, but we don’t have any secure information on it ourselves,” said Sea Watch spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects had raped, tortured and even murdered in the North African country. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). “The migrants were systematically scrupulously scrupulous and brutally exposed - by repeated and constant physical violence - it was then in the communication.
NGO and aid organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who the ships are. “We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports,” said new builders. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee from Libya. It is therefore very likely that perpetrators are also on the ships.
Italy's Justice Minister Matteo Salvini called for Rackete, who is still being found in Italy for aiding illegal immigration, immediately apologizing.
Musk targets delivery record at Tesla
Tesla chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company with the prospect of new record numbers a tremendous boost on the stock market.
“We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the Electrek industry blog.
The demand was strong, so Tesla could make 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's roundwriting. The challenge was to bring the cars to the customer soon, and to this end Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible for the quarter end.
Investors liked that: Tesla's shares went out of trade with an plus of more than six percent. The price has been out of stock for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well over 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be set in the current and next quarter of the year. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is requested, but here are the winning teams low. Despite the tree, there were last losses.
U.S. budget dispute: Renews just one bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate will follow the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided to make a transition funding until 21 November.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump have agreed in August on an increase in spending limits for the 2020 and 2021 budgets, the United States is once again with no spending plans before the new fiscal year starting on 1 October. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on a transitional funding (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, it would have come to a shutdown on Monday at midnight, a part of the federal administration. President Trump still has to put the decision into force.
Shutdown
The federal administration will now be funded at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year to end on Monday 2019. This is because Congress has not been able to meet the 12 spending laws in a timely manner to allocate funds to the various departments and authorities, so the federal administration cannot benefit from the spending framework extended for the new financial year from 1.3 Bio. to $1.4 Bio.
Democrats in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, have completed ten of the twelve laws, but the spending laws reflect priorities of Democrats who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are hardly majority capable.
In the Senate, the Republicans are trying to force $12 billion for wall construction, one of the major priorities of President Trump. Democrats are concerned about the wall construction plans and their funding, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over wall construction was escalating in December 2018 and has led to a 35-day shuttledown.
On the wall construction separates the spirits
At the moment, it is unclear how the parties would like to approach this question. More likely than an agreement on all 12 spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of transitional funding beyond November 21st. Also, a shuttle is not excluded at the time.
In the face of the ongoing inability of Congress to agree in time on the twelve spending laws, and the resulting risk of a shuttle win ideas for the automation of the process of popularity. Template p. 1877 to avoid Shutdowns, the funding of the federal administration would automatically continue at the previous year's level, hinder the travel activities of parliamentarians and refrain from their wages until the new annual spending plans are presented.
France allows artificial breeding for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial reproduction will also open to women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted with a vast majority for a bill of government that all women can take advantage of in-vitro reproduction, so that the demand for anonymous seed donations may be significantly increased.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that in the future many children without a father could grow up. The French bishop’s conference is also against the renewal.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as a “retroviral” for society. It depicts the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with gay parents.
Fertilization with sperm of dead husband further prohibited
In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial reproduction is allowed to be ‘post-mortemed’. In Germany, in the past, in which women have been in vainly charged with the execution of the sperm of a deceased person. The opponents of the procurator in Paris argued that such a child would suffer a “especially severe fate”.
On the other hand, many MPs of the La République en Marche government (The Republic in Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and MPs of the opposition spoke out for artificial reproduction with the sperm of the deceased partner. They emphasized that a widow will be imposed a “doubled grief” if her husband’s death was still unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now-failing amendment consider it unjust that a widow may be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown one in the future, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial reproduction in France has allowed only heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They have to be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in summer that the leash oily continued to be banned.
In Germany, artificial fertility is obviously open to all women - for single or lesbian couples, however, it is often difficult.
Climate compensation: Calls for airfare for Unis become louder
A lot of flights will be held at the universities, which is why the country wants to make a climate tax there in the future. The principals say they don't have any money for it, but now they're under pressure at the same time.
The universities should also be limited by flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Street School
The discussion on climate spending on flights from universities and universities that were challenged before the summer break came back into swing. After the National Rector Conference had sceptically responded to a corresponding proposal from the Green-Black Coalition, the plans now received support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral candidates from six bath-wart-berg universities and an educational university for compensation of service flights, which was the first step in urgent need, at the same time there had to be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, in their opinion. The original cabinet decision was still on ice in July, because the CDU still did not approve the presentation of the Greens.
Russia again captures North Korean fisherman
According to the FSB secret service, the arrested were to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At the time, there was a shift of gunpowder between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later suffered serious injuries, but this time there was no injury.
The Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way in Russian high-rise waters, where the Coast Guard of Russia, according to its own information, drives patrols to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 inkfish seized
In the re-controls, 30,000 inkfish were discovered and seized on the boats. In addition, the information was seized by three fishing and two motor boats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia’s fishing authorities had not issued any fishing licenses to North Koreans this year even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have been arrested there for a time this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the remote region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also accused high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished with tight synthetic networks banned in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be destroyed.
More than 18,000: The United States reduces asylum ceilings
The “biggest nation in history”: Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country of the earth is appalling itself with security seekers: as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington confirms, the upper limit is further reduced for the legal attraction of refugees.
The U.S. government wants to reduce the historically low limit to accommodate new refugees once and for all. In the economic year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed to enter the country, as the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs has stated.
The government of President Donald Trump has dramatically reduced the willingness to accept protection seekers from all over the world in recent years.
The peaked upper limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980. The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs still referred to the U.S. as “the most compassionate and generous nation in history - a formulation that strongly reminds of the use of the language of the U.S. President. language.
A “responsible treatment” of refugees aims to allow refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump said. For his hard course in migration policy, he gets much to say by supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to tear down. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a timely link between the current action and the current domestic developments in the U.S. capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure due to the Selenskyj affair and a potentially threatening office arrest procedure.
The U.S. government, according to a statement from the Foreign Office, will focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who helped the U.S. military in the country and who have thus been put in danger, as the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shows.
The U.S. wants people from this northern triangle to apply for asylum in other countries, and in view of this, the United States has only concluded with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements in order to prevent immigration on the U.S.-south border to Mexico.
Court orders release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
An Orang-Utan female was moved to the U.S. at the request of Argentine justice from the former Buenos Aires Zoo. The “Sandra” born in the Rostock Zoo in 1986 was granted the rights of a “non-human” person, which is why their release was forced. The animal was brought by direct flight to Dallas on Thursday night, but not as a passenger, but in the freight room, as Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human flesh is not able to adapt to life in the wild, it is expected to live in the open air of the Center for Great Apes in Florida, where 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees are already housed, including “Bubbles” formerly a pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before entering Florida, however, “Sandra” has to endure a 40-day quarantage at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. state of Kansas.
\"Sandra\" spent several years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process for \"Sandras\" by animal protectors in 2014 has helped to transform the Buenos Aires zoo into an ecopark. By 2023, a research and education site was to be established to preserve the diversity of species.
Record for Swiss Extreme mountaineers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The Extrembergeer Dani Arnold is a new Husaren ride in the Italian Alps at the nearly 3000-foot-high Great Zinne.
Without net, double ground or other aids, the Swiss forced the 550-metre-high north wall of the Great Tinne in a new record time.
Dressed with Jeans, T-Shirt and only supported by absolute sulfur freedom, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the rise, thus undercut the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
In spite of the trade conflict with China, U.S. sports product manufacturer Nike has found a significant gain. Net profit has risen to $1.4 billion in the last quarter (knapp 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year’s period, as the Group announced on Tuesday. For this reason, the new marketing strategy “Nike Direct” strategy, which the Adidas competitor directs to its customers online.
In the three-month period, sales increased to $10.7 billion by the end of August, and the Nike sales figures increased by 22 percent in China, making Beaverton’s Beaverton Group in the U.S. state of Oregon even in the People’s Republic of its approach to direct contact with consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive forward with strategic investments the “digital transformation” of the sports item manufacturer and thus expand its competitive advantage. The investors responded to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports item manufacturer rose by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban due to racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a life-long ban on a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil had been ridiculed by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and urged his club to take measures. “@officialasroma you already know what you are doing with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am” wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded on late Thursday. He reported to the fan's account on Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporters would never be able to visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly scant racist insults against black players of rival teams. “We can’t have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify the responsible and throw out of the stadiums - Fifa president Gianni Infantino said on weekend.
But there were also recent discussions about Juventus Turin’s supporters. The Italian authorities have now established 38 random fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them may no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said.
The fans are in line with ongoing investigations against 12 leaders of ultra fan groups in the Juventus area. The twelve are accused of severe extortion, money washing and private violence, and the club had the investigation with a display last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are to stick with tickets behind the black trade. They would have “militarily controlled” the ticket trade for the fan curve and should have pressed Juventus employees to get to more favorable cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - all year rounds are thought of with gripping designations. Look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective feelings of life of young people?
\"The Krabbs come - This call officially started on September 21st at Gucheng Lake Gaochun, which also introduced the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department of Public Works of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern outflower of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international “Slow City” in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international “Slow City” movement. The city, in an ecological sense, has ideal conditions with a mixture of “30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields” The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, the people in Gaochun began to develop into an important part of Gaochun’s economic development. Over the past few years, Gaochun has been actively involved in a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of the Krabbenzung as well as a technology-based scratch. The city has been concerned with promoting more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to “distribution of power, optimization of management and authority services” and, with care, has established the service network for “authorizations under one roof, a team for prosecution, a network for services, a platform for credit allocation” to enhance the city’s environment for approvals, services and development.
Gaochun creates the development zone and its position as an international “Slow City” as a support sign to establish intelligent high-end production companies, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health industry, as well as organic agriculture companies, which are leading in the “3+2” area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national, all areas of tourism and foreign transport of national importance, including Gaochun’s ecological and cultural resources, the state of the buildings for civil services and public service, the areas “Tourism +” and “+ tourism” further developed and the development of culture tourism at a high level of quality.
The conflict between Iran and the United States: Ruhani talks about the end of the sanctions - Trump opposes
After returning from the UN General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of an alleged offer from the United States to cancel sanctions, and the United States, in return for talks with the Tehran leadership, had put an end to all sanctions, Ruhani said on its official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, objected to Iran’s colleague via Twitter: “ Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed against him so that there would be a meeting.
Ruhani describes the event in this way: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had insisted that a meeting take place. “And America says I lift the sanctions - complemented Ruhani.
However, if this proposal is not in an acceptable manner, Ruhani criticized. In view of the current criminal measures and the poisoned atmosphere of the maximum pressure, no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York, and the hope of saving the nuclear deal with Russia and China was that the Islamic Republic would stop developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel at the edge of the UN General Assembly, had expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
After western Turkey was rocked by two earthquakes within a short period of time, fear of disaster grew. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. The 5.8 earthquake caused the Marmara region to shake off Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the millions of metropoliss. The government now wants to use a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Octay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said. In the city itself, the latent danger is again ignored. Every year, poorly built housing houses collapse - among other things, because of the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas, which have been registered in the centre as a refuge, have been built for a long time. Not until the 20th anniversary of the August Gölcük earthquake had warned Istanbul's Building Engineering Chamber that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul would not be earthquake safe.
The epicenter of Thursday's quake was in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometers of depth, as the Afad disaster protection authority reported. A small aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
The Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu announced on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. The TRT State broadcaster showed people circling out of the houses in panic. Students in the Silivri district were brought out of the buildings for safety reasons. Some students cried as was seen on pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly dangerous. Under the Marmara Sea there is a section of the so-called North Anatolian disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earthquake. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At the time, more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake could threaten 7.1 to 7.4. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called Go-Bags with all necessary packed up next to doorways, and schools teach children how to take care of themselves when the earth wakes up. When the next big quake comes, be unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu pursued the developments of the Istanbul disaster coordination centre (Akom), according to which two minarettes of mosques crashed into the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panicking. Buildings were evacuated. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Phone lines were interrupted. It has been more violent than Tuesday, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Halfmonds, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter about aftershocks. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The time of the quake is given according to official information at 13.59 a.m. (local time). Only a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a aftershock, which was given with a strength of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
It was not until Tuesday that an earthquake of 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt until Istanbul. Its epicenter also located in the Marmara Sea west of the million-metropoles, the Afad disaster protection authority said on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that earlier or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tactical plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now, and it has become more likely, he said to CNN Türk. “This could be the sign of a larger earthquake,” Ersoy said.
A few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In Albania there had also been a violent earthquake just a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also at Lake Lake Lake Lake Earth.
Parliament: New vaccine in Ukraine affair
Two brilliant documents provide new vaccines in Ukraine’s affair for possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible official detention procedure, the U.S. Democrats see themselves strengthened: the complaint filed by an anonymous indicator about Trump and its controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president’s mountains important points of investigation against the president. Trump himself once again sees himself as a victim of a “hex-hunting” also doubting the credibility of the whistleblower’s credibility.
USA: United Airlines's passenger locked in toilet - Flieger redirected
Because a passenger had been locked in the board toilet, a flight from United Airlines was redirected. The WC train had been blocked from Washington to San Francisco during the flight 1554, the airline said, according to U.S. media.
In the event of an out-of-plan landing on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the narrow cabin, and for about an hour if she had been locked in it, U.S. media wrote calling on other passengers. To continue the flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In a video distributed on the Internet, which according to U.S. media is intended to come from Flight 1554, it can be seen how several people are trying to free the woman. “We are currently working on opening the door, Ma’am. We will get you out soon, OK”, says a man in it. The airline has apologized to all passengers.
Kakerlake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unrecognizable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous story “The Change,” British successful author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit Chaos in the UK.
The novel “The Kakerlake” (Original: “The Cockroach”) will appear in German on 27 November, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) told it about the transformation of a man called “Jim Sams” who was ignored or hated in his previous life but is now at one time the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into effect and is determined to let nothing and no one stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying: “If Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers lie shamelessly like once the Soviet leaders, when Brexiteers in high positions are in a position to face the disaster of a no-deal, then a writer must ask himself what he can do.
Kafka’s first published 1915 story is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself “turning into an unheard-of unscrupulous, gradually being excluded from family and society and finally being made subject to it. “Ian McEwan is envious of Kafka to describe a world that is in the head, it was called Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria’s rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary receive whisper brakes to reduce noise loads by freight trains. In addition, sections of rail connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernized and electrified.
This is intended to make EU government travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions.
Thomas Cook: All Travels Off until October 31st
A day after his insolvence application, German travel operator Thomas Cook dismissed all trips until, including October 31, 2019. Travel could not be reached for reasons of insolvency, the company announced on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings by the brands Thomas Cook signature, Thomas Cook signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travel, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Travel and Air Marin, which have already been paid or paid for. As for travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company opened up. In accordance with the insolence insurance, the further procedure will be examined.
Thomas Cook in Germany had been in the sog of the British Mother Group’s Square and had applied for insolence on Wednesday, including Neckermann Travel, Öger Tours and Bucher Travels, employing about 2,000 people in Germany.
Auerer wants to transfer money to hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday's hotel abroad, which currently still houses Thomas-Cook-Ulährers, will receive money from the Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that holidayers are no longer invited to extra payments.
On the basis of booking information and without submission of separate bills, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesperson for the German Press Agency said. “This applies immediately and under the condition that Thomas-Cook travelers from these hotels are not immediately requested or otherwise required for individual payment of hotel bills,” said spokesperson Bernd Engelien.
The insurance therefore responded to reports from hotel guests who were forced to pay their own accommodation on site. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had been heavily criticised this.
How many hotels are affected is agreed with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, the insurance spokesman said. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook Easter vacationers were still on their way from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured holidays and return visits of the Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvence managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution to the future.
However, the now announced payouts to hotels by Zurich insurance only help the travelers who are currently on their way. For Thomas-Cook customers who are only planning to fly into the holiday, it looks bad. On late Thursday evening, the company announced that all travel until including October 31 would be cancelled. This also applies to such bookings already paid.
As for trips starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In accordance with the insolvence insurance, the further procedure will be checked, it said. Basically, insurance Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new trips is stopped. dpa
The company relies on the applicant Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. Customers could be informed on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys Sprengmine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana's engagement, and in Africa he is now walking directly on the tracks of his mother.
With a blue splitter protection vest, the British Prince Harry in Angola has set fire to and destroyed an explosive mine.
Close to a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he set up the customs circle on Friday morning. At a safe distance, the explosives in the savanna landscape exploded without damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 mining fields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his journey to Africa, Harry wanted to walk directly to the town of Huambo on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same explosive champion, who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to leave the way she went at the time. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a minefield in 1997 had also been demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip that started in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town since Monday.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has clearly stated: He will not guarantee a third suspension of the Brexit negotiations, but what statements have been made to the polarizing British by an eternity. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom is like a damocle sword over the blonde. His suspension of Parliament to be able to run its Brexit course until the departure date was cancelled in the beginning of this week. And a law adopted by Parliament required Johnson to make an extension of bilateral talks in the event of the EU by 31 October.
Boris Johnson still considers deal possible
However, the pressure does not seem to go beyond Johnson, and he has now made an indication when visiting a hospital that he is supporting an extension of negotiations in the event of a non-conformity by the end of October:
You know, we will obey the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best of all with a deal, I'm careful to be optimistic that this works.
And the time is gradually running out of Brexit in Brussels. The EU and the UK negotiators have time to prevent the UK from leaving the European Union without any agreements, but the recent talks have failed again. A deal by the end of October is currently more difficult to imagine. The British Prime Minister does not break the law, is in force again shifting the date of departure. The opposition, however, does not trust the Prime Minister's words. She fears that in the event of a no-deal, Johnson could somehow enforce the Brexit.
U.S. Government: Other deaths by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the U.S. has increased to twelve. In addition, 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this context, the U.S. Health Authority CDC reported. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there have already been more than 900 affected, about 500 confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar rise in lung damage has been known. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the U.S.
Fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Mohammed Ali’s videos were distributed millions of times in online networks, and the Spanish construction contractor and actor in it calls for a “people’s revolution” for this Friday he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military to challenge critics of corruption and abuse.
Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed. In the past few days, police had already strengthened their road controls and partially searched the mobile phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the protesters also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there was protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. An open protest had not been held in Egypt for years. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW) human rights organization, nearly 2,000 people have been arrested for the past week. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested - only because they were \"at the wrong place at the wrong time\", HRW told lawyers.
The organization has also criticized censorship in the North African country. Therefore, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after overthrowing democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially convicted in recent years.
Ocean Change: Arved Fuchs of Greenland Expedition Back
The Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. He was greeted on his arrival in the port of Hamburg, among other things by the skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg with the race yacht \"Mallizia\" across the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship Dagmar Aaen on the islands and Greenlands.
The Fridays for Future movement were a blessing, the polar researcher said. He had waited for years for the young generation to speak. For decades, it was known that the earth was warming. Despite this, many acted as if there was a planet B.
“What happens on the sea often takes place at the exclusion of the public,” said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the pollution of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, he and his team were measured with a drone of Greenland glacier ice and fished with nets for microplastics.
For his campaign for sustainable and respectful use of the world's seas, the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the \"Seadevcon Maritime Award\" as part of the Hamburg Climate Week.
Teuren Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists pay for nudels 430 euros
430 Euros for two tables of Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: This seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. Although the bill with 80 Euros of drinks money was paid by the two women, they posted the receipt on Facebook, triggering hot reactions.
“These cases damage Rome’s view, and we ask the police to investigate whether this is a fraud — a spokesperson for Federagit, the Association of Travelers in Rome, according to the Roman daily newspaper Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The Japanese had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this is not to be taken out of the bill. Also, a drinking fee of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump might have been confronted with an office detention procedure after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats want to check this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision would fall.
At the beginning of the scandal, the phone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj, who has finally brought the public to the public the conversation about national security and democracy with his complaint, is monstrous: the president has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the 2020 election.
The core of this project is also to follow up in the currently published co-written conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full wording. However, the 25th of July phone call is only an episode of a much larger history, in which the center of which is next to Trump's personal attorney: Rudy Giuliani.
From a public perspective, the story begins in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giulianis reports travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows that his intentions are very clear. “We don’t mix into an election, we mix into an investigation into what we have the right to do — he says the newspaper is inappropriate, but “there’s nothing illegal” Giuliani wants to be investigated in Ukraine for which there is hardly a basis — because this information will be very helpful to my clients and can be helpful to my government —
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixed on Trump's rival candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton conspired with players in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for Russia's findings in the United States.
This is exactly what Trump is going to say on the phone with Selenskyj. The version of Giulianis and of the President is: Former Vice President and current candidate for the Democratic presidential candidacy Joe Biden, as the President-General of the Obama government, has pushed on the resignation of Ukrainian Attorney General Wiktor Schokin, to stop the investigation of the gas company responsible for him, in whose supervisory board his son was Hunter Biden.
In fact, when Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney-General go, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, and Hunter Biden had never been directly affected. Schokin was also accused of deeply corrupt gestures, and the U.S. government was not the only Western partner at Weitem who pushed for his resignation.
Disruptions on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions on Instagram and Facebook. Therefore, Germany, the UK and Spain are particularly affected. On the website, users report that Facebook has not been loading since about 15.30 p.m. Instagram also admits the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems affected by the disorder, though not so far.
Instagram and Co. are more often affected by disruptions
It's not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and in July, the services fell out for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users are also taking advantage of Twitter this time, especially to air their anger.
Polish scientists in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were on their way with a hose and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They had luck in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for the storage.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
“At 9:30 a.m. we received the message, just before ten we were started, and good 20 minutes spàter we were over the hose.
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, 19 scientists are working there, and the frozen researchers are sure to be brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone DO NOT charge wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used anyway.
Since the last few new smartphones have come to the market, which support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - all in advance the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to call back to memory a study from early July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature adds battery
Researchers warn of the wireless charging of smartphones, which is extremely harmful to the devices, according to the findings of the University of Warwick. The reason for this is the significantly larger heat development. If a mobile phone is normally charged by cable, the battery is heated to 27 degrees within three hours. In the case of wireless charging, the researchers themselves have measured over 30 degrees on the charging pad in a perfect manner. If the mobile phone is slightly adjacent to the coil, the temperature is even higher. In addition, the water intensity of the charging pad also increases, which in turn drives the power consumption to the height.
Capacity and Lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a crucial factor. Since each individual degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only consumes capacity, but it also does not last for as long as it does. The life span is therefore lower. The researchers therefore recommend always charging the smartphone by cable. Since an battery exchange for modern smartphones is always connected with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently increased the cost of battery exchange even once again - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without an inconvenient cable salad and an effortless plug-fumble line. Since there is hardly any restrictions on the technology in the world with qi (that is for inductive energy transfer), it is only in the exception of the researchers.
Everest-Stau-Photograph: 13 eight thousand in six months
According to its own data, a Nepalese mountain climber has reached 13 of the world’s 14 highest mountains within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set up a record, he announced his expedition organizer.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight thousand people in seven months. Purja calls his project “Mission Possible” He has made international headlines: a picture of mountain climbers who stand on Mount Everest Schlang in the spring.
The image of the mass and rank sparked a debate over stronger security measures on the 8848 metres high mountain and the highest summit in the earth. In May, eleven climbers died in the crash within a few days.
A problem for Purja could become the 14th-century boost: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As a reason for this, it is called bad weather, among other things. In the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wants to talk to China to allow it to rise.
Four Dead Elephants Discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals are also a vicious elephant cow, a police spokesperson said on Friday: “We suspect that the elephants were poisoned.”
The four Kadavers were found in a shelter area near the famous and visited by many tourists of the former Sigiriya rock fortress. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old, according to the police spokesman, and an autopsy was arranged to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed each year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously held themselves harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year, mostly when the animals move through their habitat-built villages.
According to estimates in Sri Lanka, only about 7,000 elephants are still alive, and the death of them is the death penalty.
British oil tankers leave Iran
The British oil tanker, Stena Impero, leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its capture by Iran, which was announced by the Sea Office of Bandar Abbas, according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolution Guards had rejected the tankers driving under the British flag on 19 July under the charge of disregarding sea law in the Persian Gulf.
Management by Thomas Cook in the Critique
The responsible Economic Committee of the House of Commons wants to investigate the plot of the travel giant Thomas Cook, which is intended to include the board’s salary packages as well as the question of why the British government would not be able to contribute financially to the surviving company. “Our interest is in the company’s supervision as well as in the control of external book reviewers,” the committee chairman Rachel Reeves told London.
According to experts, genes are overestimated at the risk of colon cancer
The role of genes in the family-enhancing colon cancer risk has apparently been overestimated so far. In conclusion, researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg are in a current study. Other risk factors such as family diet habits are likely to be more difficult than previously accepted. This has been the result of calculations of the individual gut cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk lets Tesla stock rise
This was what Musk wrote to Tesla employees on Thursday (local time) from the “Electrek” industry blog. The demand was strong, so Tesla could make 110,000 orders, so it continued in Musks.
The challenge is to get the cars to the customer soon, which requires Tesla to provide as many resources as possible at the quarter end.
Investors found the information: Tesla’s shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. The price has been out of stock for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well over 95’000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver 360'000 to 400'000 cars in total. For this, six-digit numbers must be set in the current and next quarter of the year. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is requested, but here are the winning teams low. Despite the tree, there were last losses.
Will British government implement Brexit legislation? Johnson reluctantly
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is looking for opportunities to reverse the last law decided by Parliament against an irregular Brexit.
The law provides that the government has to apply for a shift in the deadline of departure, should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a 'capitulation law' that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had stated on Thursday that Johnson could try to use “political skikans” to implement the law. Johnson could use a procedure trick that shifted the law to the time after the EU exit.
Johnson said he was seeking a contract with the European Union. \"We are confident to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is to deal with an agreement.\"
Iran seems to be driving uranium enriching high
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has raised pressure on the European contractual partners in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. \"Leaders show the European States inability or lack of willingness to act in the event of concrete actions - said Rohani at a press conference on Thursday at the outskirts of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they do not agree to their promise, he put \"further steps\" away from the agreements of the difficult negotiated 2015 agreement.
The conflict is the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, as a counter-performance, contained the promise of Tehran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the U.S. withdrew from the agreement in order to force Iran with \"maximum pressure\" into a change of course in the Middle East as aggressively regarded. President Donald Trump's government wants to negotiate a new deal with tougher demands, and is now resuscitating hard sanctions against Tehran. Iran has recently responded to this with a resurgence of the uranium enriching limited in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used the centrifuges installed in early September with uranium or at least prepared for use.
Perhaps the Europeans were not willing to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians with the cost and burden of pushing US sanctions alone, but Rohani was supposed to be there, but there would still be other conversations that would hopefully be a solution.
Rohani continues to fight Iran’s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the U.S. estimate that Tehran was carrying responsibility for the attack. Initially, Iran-supported Huthi rebels in Yemen were known for what the U.S. believed was a false confession.
“Those who raise such accusations must present evidence for this,” said Rohani. The European leaders in the talks with him during the UN general debate did not know. Instead, they would have relied only on the fact that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, France’s President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Before possible talks with U.S. President Trump first had to be lifted from the far-reaching sanctions of the U.S. administration, Rohani demanded that the Washington government turn to a policy of \"dialect and reason\".
Comet From Other Star Crosses Solar System
Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the depths of the universe, and it was only once before that the comet allowed conclusions on other solar systems.
What was at first just a guess is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized after its discoverer at 2I/Borisov and sparked the interest of astronomers around the world.
The far-reaching comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory on Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres diameter. After observations of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object to be seen after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017.
The first observations show that the interstellar comet resembles our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands reported. “The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is far above the typical speeds of objects that orbit the sun,” said Davide Farnocchia of the U.S. Department of Transportation Nasa in a statement.
The comet is, according to the analysis, on a so-called hyperbole route that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar floating star, which was first led under the catalog number C/2019 Q4, was named 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name pointing out that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov was already on the run. Thus, the researchers remain for many months for investigations. \"The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes by April 2020 - explained Farnocchia. \"After that, it will only be with larger, professional telescopes to be observed by October 2020 -
Several observatories have already taken the visitor in sight, so a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, in a first investigation of the diameter of the sky object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Records of the Gemini Observatory on Hawaii show a clear wave of the comet.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canarys (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar sulfur star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. “The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets of our solar system, and this suggests that its composition must be similar,” IAC researcher Julia de León reported.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests, according to the IAU, that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, as often as these tips are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellars could possibly start a planned satellite mission from the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the agency wants to station the three-part space probe — Comet Interceptor — (German, for example, comet catcher hunters) at a waiting position at 1.5 million kilometers away from the Earth. According to Esa science director Günther Hasinger, it is intended to be either on an unspoilt, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing’s new mega-airport Daxing
Just before the 70th birthday of the People’s Republic, the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital is a first passenger machine to land China’s United Airlines, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, about 45 million passengers were to be completed annually at the new airport, and by 2025, it was already to be 72 million. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China’s latest prestige project is also called “seastars” because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four starting and landing trains to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic flight management system. A new subway transports passengers to the downtown city of Beijing in just 20 minutes.
As early as the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital capital infrastructure in Germany, which has been in construction since 2006, has since been reassigned. In Beijing, on the other hand, after four years, a first passenger machine had landed.
New oversonic aircraft is scheduled to fly 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - of which the UK Space Agency dreams of making it a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company develops response engines from Oxfordshire, quoted the U.S. broadcaster CNN as saying: “This is the technology that could definitely achieve that,” said agency chief Graham Turnock to the transmitter. “We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced -
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to work closer with the Australians. A flight from the British capital to the Australian Metropolitan is currently about 20 hours. As the only oversonicing aircraft for passenger transport, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until its establishment in 2003 and used it for three to three and a half hours. In 2000, it was an accident at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, where all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, U.S. aircraft builder Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft together with the U.S. Air Force Nasa, the \"X-Plan - Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
“Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport,” writes Reaction Engines on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enable the “first generation of truly re-usable grids” -
Rebellion in Washington: Trump wants to detect anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In Ukraine’s case for possible abuse of power by the U.S. President, Donald Trump wants to detect potential unsightly places in the White House.
“I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information,” Trump said on Thursday before U.S. envoys to the United States in New York. The person in question was almost “a spy” and with such being “a bit different” in the past than today.
The event was not public, but several US media were spreading audio messages on Friday. Democrats reacted to the President’s statement.
On Tuesday, Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives announced preparations for an official detention trial against Trump. Their allegations were mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence employee who raised heavy charges against Trump and his government headquarters.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to receive information from several government employees, according to which the U.S. President “uses the power of his office” to achieve that another country interferes in his favor in the 2020 U.S. election.
At the heart of the allegations is a controversial call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate who could harm his political rival Joe Biden, who was involved in former Biden's son Hunter's business in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his spruce from Ukrainian justice.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House of hiding in the face of Ukraine's agenda: leading government employees would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover. As usual an electronic text protocol was created, this was removed from a database normally intended for the White House after the conversation on the instructions of the White House lawyers and was stored in a particularly protected system.
The New York Times reported that it was an employee of the CIA’s foreign intelligence service.
On Friday, Trump again questioned the credibility of the source. In a series of tweets on the topic, the president wrote, among other things, that the “so-called whistleblowers” has spread information from a second hand that had turned out to be inadequate, so there may be no tippers or spies at all.
However, as Trump expressed himself in New York, the president of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, expressed concern and complained that Trump’s statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
The House of Representatives has been conducting various investigations against Trump and its environment for months now, with Ukraine's allegations, the Democrats are now pushing forward with new growth to launch a possible official investigation against Trump.
“The Whistleblower gave us a timetable for our investigation,” said the head of the Secret Service Committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump slammed into the ship, accused him of misrepresenting things and called for the resignation of the Chairman of the Committee. Trump regularly bombarded the ship and had already requested his withdrawal months earlier.
More than 300 former U.S. government employees from the security and foreign policy sector, mostly under democratic and also Republican presidents, were behind the investigation launched by the Democrats on Friday. If the allegations were true, it would be “an unscrupulous abuse of power” by Trump.
For the further process, there is no precise timetable. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment process. The decision on an actual office appointment fell in the Senate where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far no US president has been dismissed by an impeachment trial of the office.
VW Business Council: Jobs are being \"sluggished\"
The VW’s plans to reduce the cost of production could go to costs of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concerns the car manufacturer’s operating council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from 10 billion euros to 2023 by two billion euros.
A key factor in this is the personnel costs. The \"Economic Package\" negotiated between companies and the operating council by 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can be reduced only if it is almost proven that the activities associated with it are no longer necessary.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from operating council circles, jobs in production that do not actually stand to disposition will be \"sluggishingly down\" over another path, so that the official course is over. Thus, free-standing regulars would not often be reoccupied.
In these cases, the Board of Directors has no opportunity to force the re-occupation. In the meantime, many of the personnel who have failed to accept the work seal have increased concerns about the gradual bleeding of the vehicle works, including the fear that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is more favorable in other parts of the world.
The VW brand wants to further standardize production worldwide and control new projects centrally. This also means that costs are reduced and decisions are accelerated - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Andreas Tostmann said at a manager’s conference in Berlin: “In times of uncertainty from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the United States and China, we are well advised to make ourselves cry-proof -
For example, since 2013, the production costs of each vehicle would fall in comparison to the previous year. Before journalists Tostmann said that the production time for the Gulf 8 to be presented on October 24 in Wolfsburg would be reduced by 1.1 hours.
20 hours.
In our region, Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The works are made in Braunschweig and Salzgitter. For Wolfsburg, VW-Intern, the rule of thumb is that 800,000 cars must be built annually so that the plant is satisfactoryly profitable. In 2018, however, the load in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - subject to the sinking diesel demand and the problems in converting to the new consumption and exhaust testing process WLTP.
As Tostmann has announced last year, however, in Wolfsburg, a million cars are expected to roll from the band, which is intended to enable the alliance of golf production in the stem plant - because the Zwickau plant gives off the golf certification by remodeling to the location for the e-car production.
The SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are also being produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, the expectations now rest on the Gulf 8. In spite of all efforts to build e-mobility, it is expected to remain the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburgers.
Forced to prostitution with Voodoo: human trafficking
Young women from Nigeria have been charged with swearing, being thrown to the backseat and forced to prostitution. Six alleged human traders must go to prison for this.
Six alleged Nigerian human trafficking dealers were sentenced to imprisonment and imprisonment for up to eight years and three months on Friday in Bochum, and young women from Nigeria had been jailed and forced to commit prostitution. In order to enforce their obedience, the volunteers had yet to make a ritual oath in front of a Voodoo priest in the home.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought to the Mediterranean by Libyan sluices. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. In Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to complete the alleged closing costs of an average of 25,000 euros.
The defendants — four men and two women — had admitted to the inclusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians on Bordelle in the process. “The work made it physically and mentally difficult for women to create,” said Judge Isabel Hoffmann in the judgment announcement.
The rulings are based on advertising and gang-related inclusion of foreigners, human trafficking, indulgence and heavy forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIn a continuous dispute with the Lufthansa Group, Ufo’s airline again threatened with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will, on 14 October, be informed of the labour campaign measures in the LH Group, share with Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its daughter Eurowings have been refusing to conduct tariff negotiations with UFO for months.
At this point, Ufo now looks at a decision made by the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to prove that the tariff contracts had not been cancelled. The court rejected the application. The company confirmed the decision and checked to file legal funds on the other hand. \"That a second court sees the matter completely differently, I think it is unlikely - Ufo CEO Flohr said.
In August, Lufthansa had also submitted an application to the Frankfurt National Labour Court for a judicial review of the status of the UFO as a union. The company argued that the union has not used a representative board for months and is therefore unable to fulfill its role as a tariff partner.
The UFO, due to the doubt of its leadership, had already begun to have a UFO vote on the Eurowings’ strikes at the end of July, was a major leadership dispute in the division union, with numerous members of the board as well as the advisory board, including longtime union chief Nicoley Baublis.
Available entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet until now, but it is now about to change, and the country at the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa destinations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future, and by 2030 the number of international and domestic visitors wants to increase to 100 million per year, the tourism commission said.
“The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is a historic moment for our country,” said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult to access. Visas are usually available only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with members in the desert state grant. With the new rules, the old conservative kingdom is hoping to increase revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trading.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. In the Folge, national oil production dramatically broke down, the oil prices would be high. It would take several weeks for the oil production of the kingdom to reach its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted on Thursday (local time) in their Instagram stories several party photos on which she can see in the white wedding look. Reality-Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others, according to People magazine, had organized a youth party in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colorful, including bananas-printed suits on Instagram and asked his supporters, “Help me choose my smoking for the wedding,” according to media reports, the promi-paar wants to marry churchly next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves a yes word a year ago in a New York state office.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that the two had found a common level after initial problems: “If you don’t want to compromise, you can’t make a relationship.”
Two deaths in plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreckage was discovered on Friday in a forested area near the city of Mecin (Metschin), the police told the dead that it was a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday night after the crew had issued an emergency signal via GPS. In the search, a military helicopter was also in use. The accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened by extinction
In addition to pests, isolated species, non-sustainable wood strike and the growth of cities caused by the threat, the World Nature Protection Union of IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It examined the stocks of all 454 species known in Europe. 265 of them are on no other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus are facing extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from “potentially endangered” to “dangerous” “strongly endangered” from extinction threatened, and “extinct in nature” to extinction, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as at risk.
Eberese and Wild Rossastany Threatened
In Germany, Eberese (Sorbus) is particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. “Most of them are threatened because the populations are small anyway, or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats.”
It has been considered a “dangerous” stage for two of the IUCN’s population since 2017. The first threat is next to a fungal Balkan miner moth. Since the 1980s it has spread from south-east Europe across the continent and has hardly natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild roscastania (Aescuus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 copies. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and alone.
Strauch species and moose also at risk
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European red lists for soft animals, shrubs and moose. More than one-fifth of soft animals and moose and almost half of all species of shrubs are threatened, according to the IUCN. This lies primarily at the destruction of the wilderness, in migratory species, agricultural practices and climate change. Soft animals such as snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and being an important source of food for birds and other animals.
“This report shows that the situation for many overlooked and underestimated species is precise, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet,” said Luc Bas, IUCN director of the European Office.
Earthquakes before Istanbul: 34 injured reported
At the latest earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. There were no deaths. Thousands of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged. Since the earthquake on the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. The 5.8 earthquake had shook the Marmara region before Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the millions of metropoliss.
In the last 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered particularly dangerous. Under the Marmara Sea there is a section of the so-called North Anatolian disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian Earth Plate.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the 7.6 strength in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeast Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed.
On Tuesday, an earthquake of 4.6 shook the region around Istanbul, and the authorities called on residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira appear in the half-time show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football finals Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers at Twitter. “Greater it will not be,” Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She was excited to stand on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of appearing in the Super Bowl since 1996 - at the time she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the half-time show. “Now it’s even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I’m going to perform with another Latina - you can’t wait to show what we girls can do on the largest stage in the world -
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honored to stand alongside another artist on one of the world’s largest stages and represent Latinos and Latinas from the United States and around the world. “And then on my birthday, the main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, it was the first time the two ‘queen’ were together on stage.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against sinking viewer numbers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and half-time show are among the most popular TV broadcasts in the United States. Even if you have seen viewers fall last: this February, the spectacle in the U.S. attracted the fewest viewers for more than ten years.
The last Super Bowl half-time show of the last Super Bowl had been in front of riots: In the fight for dealing with quarterback Colin Kaepernick, the top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear. Finally, the Maroon 5 pop group launched the half-time show - the criticisms were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had gone to the knee in the 2016/17 game before NFL games at the National Hymn from protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick released a movement, many players took over the gesture. This resulted in great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the most African American football stars sharp. Kaepernick himself has been inseparable since March 2017 and has no longer contested the NFL party.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are expected to be expensive to pay the price of the travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press report. It threatens high deposits on outstanding bonds and loans. This is also affected by the credit Suisse, writes the “Financial Times” in her issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or the Credit Suisse would have to make a total of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (about €2 billion) on their books, according to the report.
The creditors of bonds had to buy off from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the creditors between 550 and 825 million pounds. The actual tenders that were to be written out would be more likely to be located at the upper end of the bandwidth, an expert said.
How big the losses of the creditors will actually be in the end will be after the bankruptcy process is over. One of these procedures close to the person did not promise too much hope. For example, Thomas Cook’s about 40 aircraft in the UK “old” and many of the real estates are in bad positions. Most of the money can be obtained by selling the airport locks and the Thomas Cook brand.
Rackete is supposed to have brought murderers to Italy
\"We can't exclude this, but we don't even have secure information about it,\" said the spokesperson of the Sea-Watch refugee organization, Ruben Neubauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They were accused of rape, torture, and murder in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the capture camp in Italy. New builders emphasized that the refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships.
Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June while ramming a ship from the Italian financial police, and the three suspects were also to arrive there.
The United States warns the U.S. against Huawei
The head of the U.S. Internet Authority Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government to trust Chinese network equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too big - said Pai to the \"Handlesblad\" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has committed a national security law, which every company, under Chinese law, to follow the instructions of the security bodies.
The applicable law also forbids companies to inform third parties of such requests, as the FCC chief continues. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a declaration of loyalty from suppliers.
First, Berlin wants to try to control the risks, for example, with technical solutions, the “Handelsblatt” reports on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology not only consists of the hardware:
The software is especially important to keep the devices up-to-date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time,” Pai said.
“It’s very difficult to imagine that a government authority, no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks,” said the FCC chief.
To the Chinese Huawei Group, he issues close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The employee company, which is said to belong to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government,” Pai said.
The U.S. presented evidence that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to advertise for the position of the U.S..
Chemical factory in northern France fires: schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A huge wall of fire lights the sky above a northern French chemical factory. The fire has been extinguished after hours - the cleaning could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and children's crickets in the region remain closed.
In 12 municipalities, the facilities would not be able to open cautiously on Friday, the responsible prefecture. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to stop smoking. The injured were not allowed. Farmers and breeders were called upon to bring their animals in, protect their food, and put the harvest in the first place.
The fire could be completely erased on Thursday evening, as the Prefecture reported. There is still the risk that after the deletion of smell spread, the prefecture on Twitter. According to the Prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police officers and gendarmen were in use at the fire station.
A huge black smoke column had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the company’s Lubrizol factory, which produces extras for oils. The production plant is a few kilometers away from the city centre.
The Normandy factory is part of the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites that are particularly monitored, and in the Italian Seveso at Milan it was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The Prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news station BFMTV that it was not “high poison” in samples at first. However, a pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river, dams were built against pollution, the Prefecture explained.
The fire broke out at 02.40 a.m. in the early morning, the authorities reported. The cause was not clear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: \"Germany must invest, and it is now -
French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to increase investments to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany needs to invest, and the earlier the better, the better,” Le Maire said on Thursday evening when the French budget was introduced for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is at a low ebb, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions.
These states, which had a budget space for more investment, had to act, said Le Maire, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these spaces, added the minister and referred to the high state debt of its country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product.
In recent years, France has repeatedly come to Germany to make more public investments in order to sustain the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly asked France to tackle its budget deficit.
The French budget presented on Thursday for 2020 provides tax relief of more than €9 billion for households.
The French government, among other things, is responding to the protests of the yellow-west movement. The new debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson raises a question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson criticised the 'capitulation law' passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a slump.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he wants to enforce an irregular Brexit - despite the last law decided by Parliament, which is exactly what should prevent it.
The law provides that the government has to apply for a shift in the deadline of departure, should not reach any agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a 'capitulation law' that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had made the assumption that Johnson could try to use “political Shikans” to implement the law on Thursday. The Premier could use a prosecuting trick that shifted the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. “We are confident to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is with an agreement -
Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, explained that he felt the political disputes surrounding the Brexit as a ‘scattering in the park’ and showed confident that the EU’s efforts were still under way: “We will enjoy that, we will win, we will leave the EU, no worries,” said Cummings of the British newspaper ‘Telegraph’, according to a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign “Vote Leave” during the election campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, now serves as head street in the UK government seat Downing Street, behind the uncompromising policy that has led the Premier into a rather hopeless situation.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the big rock photographers, but it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photobook \"The Polaroid Diaries\" (bags) dives deep into the whole private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda’s death in 1998, was apparently proud and touched when he presented the picture band “The Polaroid Diaries” at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September. Among the more illustrious guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders front wife Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: “#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeing look at the life of an exceptional family from time to time before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney’s legacy as a dedicated artist and the sofortmagia of the Polaroid film.
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made it, a few hundred of them are now published in The Polaroid Diaries for the first time.
They are portraits, still life, landscapes, several Hamster, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. “She wanted real moments” is written by the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is always at the center: her husband, Paul, as you may never have seen him.
As he dances with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, calling in the bathrobe with a towel on his head or carrying unshaped Moonboats. Certainly, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but who lived beyond the headlight on her farm in southern England or Scotland, and so Mary McCartney said, according to BBC, that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had bathed from old potato boxes, and on the contrary, it was not always with the McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney's recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure snaps.
It’s about the decision-making click: you have to recognize if a great photo happens before you. And then you have to cut it at exactly the right moment — Paul McCartney said. “Knipping two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo — and Linda would have had the gift to always capture exactly the right moment. “She just knew she has it,” Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the image cut, and the colors, which makes “The Polaroid Diaries” not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure in addition to everything else, where landscapes also act like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly re-established Beatles album “Abbey Road” that appeared just 50 years ago.
“We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran.
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from neighboring countries despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published Friday that Turkey cannot cancel the oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there,” Erdogan said in New York, where he had participated in the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems in importing Iranian oil, as some companies had - due to US threats - to withdraw.
Nevertheless, Turkey, especially in this issue and many other issues, will continue our relations with Iran, said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of \"maximum pressure\" towards the Islamic Republic since its departure from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the US, Iran secretly pursues a nuclear program and does not adhere to the agreement.
Its sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, the tensions in the Gulf region have been significantly intensified.
The U.S. government wants to restrict the collection of refugees
The U.S. government plans to drastically restrict the capture of refugees, and the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs declared on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a new settlement program is reduced from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which corresponds to a 40 per cent cut.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that the United States would continue to see the support of refugees, but the most important task was to protect and serve U.S. citizens. At the time, the U.S. immigration system was overburdened.
The U.S. government will focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and who are thus in danger of being put to the test by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be taken.
In the 1980 program, refugees from all over the world are selected and re-established in the United States. The top of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program’s history. Already the current top limit of 30,000 is a low. As the predecessor of U.S. President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was almost 85,000.
“This is a very sad day for America,” said the Chief of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, which would further damage the U.S.’s leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the U.S. - illegal and illegal - according to its own report for the coming financial year, 350,000 asylum applications. These figures are separate from the newly established program.
Donald Trump - \"Comes Near a Top\"
U.S. President Donald Trump has testified to the espionage in the whistleblower affair. Whoever has given evidence of abuse of power to him, “comes close to a tip,” Trump said, according to a recording of a private event in New York on Thursday, reports several U.S. media.
When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial White House operations, Trump replied: “That’s a tip — then Trump added: “Do you know what we did in ancient times when we were smart?
The Democrats made sharp criticism of Trump's statements and accused him of being intimidated by witnesses and of trying to prevent a congressional investigation into a possible office detention proceedings against him, the chairman of the Foreign, Secret Services and Supervisory Committees wrote in the House of Representatives.
The whistleblower, in a now-published complaint, accuses the president of having abused his office in order to ask for an invasion of another country into the 2020 U.S. election, including his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian colleague Wolodymyr Selenskyj in summer: Trump accused him of launching investigations against his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any wrongdoing.
However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is intended to be an analyst of the CIA’s foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat crammed: Baby and grandchildren drown in Aegean
Time and again, people are trying to get across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece, and the boats are often too small, and seven migrants have now been killed, including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed in the fall of a hose. Among the victims were a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were therefore rescued from the floods from the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims was also to be a locker, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken up in the morning from Turkey. They had tried to reach the small island group Inouses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inouses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean are currently over, mostly in many small boats, and last year 174 people were killed on this route according to the United Nations refugee aid plant (UNHCR).
The Who breaks off concert
A U.S. concert by the rock band The Who, due to the impeccableness of lead singer Roger Daltrey, found an end. In the middle of the Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed. At the eighth song, Daltrey said to the audience: “I think I should leave it as long as it’s still running.
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for apologies and complemented that Daltrey could “now really not speak” to the public, promising Townsend to come to his expense at a restitution concert.
For Fridays in Dallas and Sundays in Denver, The Who said they were to be retrieved at a later time. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting suddenly adjusted: WeWork lets real estate markets sit down
In New York, WeWork has risen to the largest office renter.
Within a few years, WeWork has risen from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets, but now the company is in crisis.
The WeWork office owner’s crisis threatens to disrupt balance in the world’s largest real estate markets. A few days ago, founder Adam Neumann had set off as chief, moved the planned stock exchange and started selling subsidiaries and values like the private jet for the executives to gain financial space for the next few weeks and months. In addition, the British “Financial Times” WeWork reports that weWork has stopped the closure of new leases with immediate effect, including in New York and London, the largest tenant of office areas is suddenly off the market.
WeWork hires large office areas in the long term and hires them in part small units to members. These can be individual freelancers, small startups, or entire departments of major corporations. WeWork with this business will burn money at stunning speed. Last year, the company entered a $1.6 billion loss, with a revenue of $1.8 billion. This year, only the rent costs by renting will have increased to an estimated $2.5 billion. In order to limit the loss, the new management will have drawn the emergency brake and stopped renting new areas with immediate effect.
According to the “Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded rental contracts with time limits of up to 15 years, from which commitments of more than $40 billion are due, which could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but also for the entire real estate markets.
According to economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the world’s most expensive real estate markets, in the past 24 months, almost 300,000 square meters of office space. Only WeWork’s new contracts made sure that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new ones that came to the market in this time period. Without WeWork’s expansion, the office capacity in the U.S. metropolis would rise at this time, as Alpert wrote in the Business Insider. Similarly, in London, where WeWork is currently operating several dozen office locations in the best location.
Also in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could be felt without any further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a office house purchased by the savings fund provider Deca for almost 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis last year.
Many tenants have converted their properties to the requirements of WeWork with high investment. If WeWork succeeds in making its business model soon profitable, the property owners would have to write down some of the billions of revenue that were hoped for. Access to the reserves of WeWork, however, does not have them in spite of the long-term rental contracts. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by additional subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only in close proximity.
Russia again captured numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen, and in recent days a total of 262 wildlifeers who fished in the waters have been caught illegally, the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB reported to the Interfax agency on Friday.
It was only ten days ago that 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested and three of them were injured. This time there was no injuries, it was called, and the Communist North Korea suffered from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way to Russian high-rise waters, where the Coast Guard of Russia, according to its own information, was able to protect their marine biological resources patrols. The re-controls were found 30,000 inkfish. In addition, the information after three fishing and two motor boats were seized and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to the Ria Novosti Agency Agency, the Coast Guard Guard in 2018 determined more than 8,000 violations in total.
The Russian fishing authority had not issued any fishing licenses to North Koreans even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the remote region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also accused high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with tight synthetic networks banned in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would spend 200 years to be destroyed. The ships themselves do not correspond to the hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow’s three members of the Russian Coast Guard, a also wounded North Korean died from his injuries, and on 17 September, Russian border guards first set up a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened the fire.
US hangs entry ban against ex-president Castro
The U.S. has imposed a ban on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children's entry bans, and the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs has established this in a statement on Thursday with Castro's participation in \"great human rights violations\" as Chief of the Communist Party of the Caribbean, in which thousands of Cubans would be arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, Fidel Castro, the brother of the deceased leader of the revolution, is also responsible for human rights violations by the support of President Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. \"The abuse of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela - the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo tweeted.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had declared entry bans against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, for months, there has been a bitter battle of power between the government and the opposition. The US has imposed a series of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him into the knee and to help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies to Maduros. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for services sent to doctors. According to the United States and Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people want to go back to the streets for more climate protection.
At the conclusion of an international climate strike week, the movement Fridays for Future is planning new actions and announcements in dozens of countries around the world. The start may be due to the time shift of New Zealand and Australia, before the protests move across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large-scale announcement in Canada’s Montreal. Also, before the White House in Washington, protesters wanted to gather.
How big the global response this Friday will be after the record opening up of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. “Last Friday more than four million people have struggled for the climate. This Friday we do it again,” she wrote on Twitter. To date, 6383 actions have been carried out in 170 countries.
A good third of all the world’s protesters - around 1.4 million - have participated in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates from Fridays for Future. This time, a list of the movement has been planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolitans such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in Nordrhein-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set himself before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 in order to encourage its country’s politicians to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. Within a short period of time, the Fridays-for-Future movement was created. The climate protests mainly involve students and students, but increasingly scientists and other adults alike.
Together, they call for more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate disaster, and, above all, global warming has to be slowed down to under 1.5 degrees compared to the pre-Industrial era, according to the Paris Climate Agreement.
Thunberg arrived in New York, where she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations, and on Monday she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she spoke to the heads of the State and Government of the Earth, and on Wednesday she was assigned to the State of Stockholm’s home for more climate protection of the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
People in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This is a change to fire protection. “This also applies to smoking,” said a spokesperson for the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow, Tass’s agency.
If the cigarette should light a fire, then the penalty would be higher. Under the ban, the Ministry would also be allowed to burn candles. Even to grill meat on the balcony, it is no longer allowed.
Battle against cybercriminals - investigators lift out servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time raised a large server provider for illegal stores in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of hosting numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach at the Moselle, through the internationally acting criminals.
Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night in a major action. The Darknet is a protected part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are expected to have been the operators of the world’s second largest Darknet marketplace for drugs, “Wall Street Market” — which had been destroyed by investigators in the spring. Also, the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers in late November 2016 was controlled by a cyber bunker, according to the Attorney General.
Such a host has been evicted in Germany for the first time. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and abroad. It has been a result of nearly five years of investigations.
New Global Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people want to go back to the streets for more climate protection.
At the conclusion of an international climate strike week, the movement Fridays for Future again planned actions and announcements in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolitan areas such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in Nordrhein-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a grand announcement in Canadian Montreal.
Who are Thunberg’s backers?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. The most amazing thing is that a 16-year-old girl keeps the power people of that time before the nose. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or clever for a climate activist? Historical master performance or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people up for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young person is able to win a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has felt selected to use himself for a more just world. At the time, he has also been able to win a scar of young people for himself and has persuaded them to cross the sea to get into the beloved country, similar to Greta Thunberg recently made his way to America with a sailing boat.
But there is also a shadow side? Why does a stock called “We don’t have time” to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. In addition, her mother has published a book that has been sold extensively, thanks to the daughter standing in the rampage light. Also, old-time followers of Greta Thunberg were a little frustrated about the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably too thick. This is not unfounded, because the action was very well received in the media worldwide, and there is a lot of money due to the impressive action.
Is it still authentic to work with stock exchange brokers during the World Rescue Action? No matter what position is ultimately involved, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratically characterized society, because democracy is a product of different opinions and discussions, and therefore it can also make sense to critically question seemingly strange projects of certain trends.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A foreign comet crosses our solar system right now.
The assumptions of astronomers have confirmed: A foreign comet is at the moment crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and is currently employed worldwide astronomers.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers on Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov on Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was seen during the flight.
The great chance for astronomers is now to get insights into a foreign solar system from close proximity. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canarys reports. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbel railway that leads it out of our system.
Comet has been face-to-face before arrival - and can be observed for several months
However, before it is so far, astronomers can observe it implicitly, because unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in its flight, which means that it can be examined from the Earth for many months. “The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes by April 2020,” explains Davide Farnocchia of the U.S. Department of Transportation Nasa, “after that it will only be with larger, professional telescopes to be observed by October 2020.
The new visitor's predecessor: 1I/2017 U1 - Oumuamua -
First findings about Comet 2I/Borisov awaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - for as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the floating star is similar to ours. This observation is very close to the fact that comets could form in other solar systems by similar processes as in our, complemented by the León College Javier Licandro.
The observation, however, goes beyond individual knowledge, which two such objects have already been discovered within just two years, may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
It was not until recently that a giant asteroid passed over the Earth, and it was dangerous for her to get close to it.
\"Absolutely reprehensible: Rachel Johnson abducted by brother
Before his younger brother leaves the cabinet, his sister, in clear words, shoots the Prime Minister’s warrior language as “less tasteless” it is not the brother they know.
\"Capitulation - fraud - contract - Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to prepare - at least verbally. At the time of the question at the lower house on this Wednesday, this was due to massive outrage of the opposition, and in the meantime, further critics have reported on: Dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the stationer Sky News to use words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit should be \"hanged, long-distanced, quadrupled, tarnished and sped-up\". They considered this highly reprehensible. They did not recognize the version of their brother, Rachel Johnsons, who had been in the elections to the EU Parliament for the Anti-Brexit Party (Change UK).
She was particularly concerned that her brother Jo Cox mentioned, an EU-friendly under-house officer who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 exit referendum, whose memory can best be honoured by getting through the Brexit, Boris Johnson said in the lower house. “It is very tasteless to refer to a MP who was murdered by someone who called ‘Britain first’, who now criticized Johnson’s sister. The perpetrator came out of the right-wing camp, who felt “comforted by this kind of language.”
The widow of Cox also criticized the prime minister harshly. “It makes me sick if Jo’s name is used like that,” he tweeted. The best way to honor them is if you are passionate and determined about what you believe - no matter what you think you are. But never can you demonize the other side - He also complained that an atmosphere was created, which was more likely to be in the attacks.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had laid down his office as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory's deputies. \"I've been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest over the past few months - it's an unresolvable tension - Jo Johnson founded the step.
Johnson’s language was also heavily criticized in the Church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and Archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that “this country is not worthy” of. In a joint statement, they declared: “In the past few days, the language, both in debates and outside parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak to each other with respect.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong sign in the year of its 100th anniversary: In the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear.
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the next final of the U.S. Football League NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
“I feel incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community in addition to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the United States,” Shakira said in a video.
The finale of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place in Miami on February 2nd. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira - Waka Waka - comes from Colombia, Lopez - On the Floor - is the name of Mantto-rican origin.
“I love that the Super Bowl puts two women on stage this time, and two Latinas,” Lopez said, sending an important message to all Americans and the world.
The 50-year-old was born in New York City after her parents were expelled from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed with songs such as “Waiting For Tonight” or “Let’s Get Loud” big hits and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is seen in the “Hustlers” drama in German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. Her worldwide breakthrough created her in 2001 with her first two-language album and the single “Whenever, Whereever”
The announcement of half-time guests is expected to be stressed every time in the United States. This year, many also consider the choice as political gesture. Finally, the country, not least due to President Donald Trump's immigration policy, is deeply split.
The Super Bowl is the largest U.S. sports event and at the same time a huge advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones provided furore there. Usually watching far more than 100 million TV viewers at the NFL final, it is now extremely popular in Germany.
Last year, political controversy broke out in the front. The dispute was over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to fight against black police violence in the process of playing the national anthem, and for this, among other things, had gone hard by U.S. President Donald Trump. From solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had refused to perform a super bowl, including Rihanna and Pink. That the Maroon 5 rock group was eventually criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber assigns Egypt's ruler: First, Mohamed Ali but prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who influenced the flow of blood on Egypt’s roads spent the past week both abroad. One of them was back at Cairo Airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. In 2013, the Muslim Brother Mohammed Mursi, the country’s first freely elected head of state, had spent a pleasant time in New York: U.S. President Donald Trump had praised Sisi’s actions against political Islam and had not lost any silbes over the human rights violations at the Nile in a week when Egypt’s security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the president.
Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad where he withdrew from the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him when he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as only a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the ton of voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafes, living quarters and teases of the country: with his Youtube channel “Mohamed’s secrets,” Ali calls on his countrymen to raise themselves against Sisi.
He goes to the head of state directly and in a very rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president is swung in luxury and let themselves build beautiful new palaces. The army's leadership, on which Sisi relies, rejects corruption and enriches. Because in his second job as a builder for 15 years with just these men's businesses, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least the impression of many Egyptians, as the click numbers just to be exploded show.
After the past week, for the first time since Sisi’s grip had demonstrated thousands against his rule and nearly 2,000 citizens, among them prominent civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a “million march” for that Friday. That really so many people were on the streets was unlikely. But there were some smaller protests, for example, in Giseh at Cairo and in the village of Kina at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests that participants in Al-Sisi questioned immigration and called for his departure. In these protests, the police also set up tear gas and rubber shots. These videos did not prove to be independently verified. The police called them the protests ended.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators broke banners with the president's portrait in pieces last week. On Friday, massive police presence was reported. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the exit streets. In Cairo, several subway stations in the downtown were closed for maintenance work, most of the streets around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 Revolution, were blocked. And on the Rabaaa Square, where supporters of the destroyed Muslim Brother Mursi were disembarked in 2013 until the army caught them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another law should prevent the failure of meeting: Sisi's future party wanted to carry out a grand announcement here for the president.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements for a change in his tactics: “Our goal does not have to be the Tahrir Square,” said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera.
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection is always much slower than the provider, there are various test options.
Anyone who completes an Internet contract does not need to blindly trust the speed data of the providers. Customers can check for how much of it is actually achieved in case of accidents.
Finally, the pre-promised transfer rates are a contract component and should therefore also be reached, explains the consumer centre Bayern.
If the connection is always much slower than recommended by the provider, there are various test options, so the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
“The tests of the providers, however, are carried out according to the provider-specific requirements and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively - give the consumer-central Bayern to consider on their side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set an appropriate time limit of usually 14 days to produce the promised performance.
If this does not result in multiple calls, customers can cancel and, if necessary, demand damages. But with continued success, only the path of complaint will help.
First rank Republican for investigation
“I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this is going from here, the facts that are being determined are determined,” said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone call to investigate democratic presidential and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
Republicans have held back so far with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have expressed disapproval of it. Scott’s statements are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already repeatedly opposed Trump’s policies, such as the locking of environmental regulations and the strengthening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man Stays in MCU: Another Marvel Film Planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: By the end of August, Sony and Marvel will be going separate paths in the future. Tom Holland’s Spider-Man would no longer be part of the “Avenger’s Universe.”
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), which reports several U.S. media. Therefore, the cinema launch is also expected to take place in the United States as of 16 July 2021.
In the magazine Screenrant, Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted as saying: “I am pleased that Spidey’s way will continue in MCU. I and all at Marvel-Studies are highly pleased that we can continue working on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verses.
But how does it get to the sudden good news? Apparently Sony Marvel should have submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney group, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate in the revenue of Spider-Man films with 30 percent.
Thus, Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the “Suits” final.
After nine seasons, the “Suits” series has now reached the big finale in the United States. In the last episode, there have been many happy ends and as many comeo performances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who spent many years in the series, have been awarded tribute in a charming way. Consider the following sections include spoilers to the series finale.
In the finale, Duke Meghan did not return for a last farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some reviews showed the most memorable scenes with the present Duchess, such as the moments of the failed and the happy wedding with Mike or how they welcomed him after his sentence.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned in the “Suits” finale, of course, in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is just calling towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a promising comment about his suit. Whether he actually passed a gown, the veiled Harvey wants to know about the wedding, only to add to it snugly: “Louiss, you are not the Prince of England”
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children were drowned in the sight of a refugee boat in the Aegean. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard announced on Friday. The nationalities were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, located between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be rescued.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferred to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations refugee aid plant (UNHCR) 174 people were killed. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced the intention of visiting both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the competent EU Commissioner, he wants to inform Turkey about the situation of refugees, said Seehofer on Friday, after which he wants to learn more about the “administrative problems of Greeks” in Athens in order to help deal with them.
A spokesperson for the EU Commission confirmed on Friday the planned trip of Seehofers with EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, there are still unusual immigrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people were transferred to the Greek islands, according to the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still functioning?
The increased figures raised the latest doubt as to the functioning of the EU Turkey Agreement closed in 2016, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who come across Turkey illegally to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to adopt a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian displaced Syrian.
In Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, there are almost 29 400 people living in a camp with capacity for 650 people, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey refugee package in March 2016 have so many been there, the state-run radio reported.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
In the future, climate change will test the health system. Climate changes will be “very safe,” one of the biggest challenges for the health system over the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, president of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and high temperatures to create within a short period of time and led to increased heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetes are affected.
Green politician must be responsible for embarrassing photopans
The Chief of Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was manipulated for this reason by the cup?
The Canadian Green Chefin holds a multi-way cup in a photo. But now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally, it seems. The re-usable coffee cup with metal straw, Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, has never been kept in hand. On the party's website, she was shown in a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also spread to the media - and there was still a scrapper (paper) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green-Chefin must be responsible for photopans
The National Post subsequently accused May of manipulation and that the Fake News party is producing more credible information on the issue of environmental protection, and that in the middle of an election campaign on the lower house election, in which it also has Trudeau increasingly difficult due to a bribe scandal.
A user shares a counter-transfer of the photos and writes: “The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their one-way cup.
May was shocked and insulted on her blog to know nothing about this action. To emphasize this, she posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she put it right, being from bamboo. She always told him. A spokesperson of the party said that it was just about to accommodate the party logo in the picture, and not to hide something. From the photo, there is only one cut out of the website.
“I don’t want to call him stupid, but there’s nothing to hide from the Guardian and at the same time, she asks herself something from her overt team: “If they once again like to edit a picture, then they couldn’t do anything with my face, so I looked younger.”
The German Greens were also advised about their use of one-way plastics or for flight trips in Shitstorms - but their images were not photoshoped. So the chief of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, on holiday ice with plastic spoons, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng was guaranteed an upgrade by Cathay Pacific by mail, but when she asked for the check-in, she was not allowed to board - and she was never allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontan gets an upgrade for the Business Class - many of which dream of passengers. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at the check-in offer an exchange from the Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how it should not be done: A self-proclaimed influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On 30 May, it flew back from Taiwan to New York and 7 June.
On the run-off, the Jaqueline staff refused an upgrade, although they showed an e-mail that their Cathay Pacific was allegedly offering an upgrade. The letter wants the influencer to have received from a marketing employee of the airline. On the other hand, the airline accuses Jaqueline of having faked the mail.
In fact, on the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time the woman should have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The staff at JFK Airport were skeptical: they were hooking up at the center. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail is supposed to have resigned the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport cancelled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a life-long flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about €1,280) they had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests, because Cathay had paid the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, it remains closed for future flights. The airline’s conditions also say that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied - and is now a lawyer.
Oil prices according to report on ceasefire in Yemen
The oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday afternoon. Finally, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea variety of Brent cost $61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
A report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen, Saudi Arabia is expected to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia in mid-September had caused five percent of the world's oil production. The Huthi rebels associated with Iran in the Civil War country of Yemen had proclaimed the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the U.S. government, is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would deplore the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is to be reached, one can focus on growth and demand care, Ole Hansen, head of the Department of Material Strategy at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg news agency, said.
A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to $59, Brent was nearly $65.
Finally, Bloomberg had reported on Insider that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia had progressed faster after the attack in mid-September than thought. Thus, the production volume had again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original quantity.
More recently, there have been multiple press reports calling on insiders who report on the rapid progress of Saudi Aramco state oil company during repair work. However, raw material experts have pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a stock exchange and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker - Stena Impero - is more than two months after the fixation by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing the departure while the ship continues to lie ahead of anchor, ship chief Erik Hånell told the Swedish broadcast in an SMS on Friday morning.
The fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the U.S. and the United Kingdom had temporarily pushed oil prices to a high level in recent weeks.
Complaints against Trump are intensifying
A number of leading government employees had made an earnest effort to prevent access to the conversation at the end of July after a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. This declared an anonymous signatory. The spokeswoman of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of \"controversial\" Trump of a \"Hexenjagd\"
North Korea considers Trump and Kim's third summit to be questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that it will soon come to a third summit of powerkeepers Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump. The sense and prospects of success of such a meeting are questionable due to lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to KCNA agency.
The U.S. had done nothing to implement the summit’s decisions in the previous year, the advisor to the North Korean Foreign Ministry said, and he also criticized US sanctions and the joint US and South Korea military maneuvers, but he hoped that Trump’s “wise and courageous” decision would come to an end.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit meeting with Kim had to be held before he prepared for it. The negotiations on a demolition of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have been held since Trump and Kim's failed second summit in February in Hanoi. In June, both of them met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states, and agreed to continue the consultation, but without great success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers are supposed to help with mining
In Angola, the British Prince Harry has symbolically burned and destroyed an explosive mine. Close to a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he created the customs circle. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded. Looking at the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later called out to running TV cameras: “I call all the countries whose names are on those weapons, but have not helped them to commit themselves to help -
Pend under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In view of a short-term interest rate reduction, the pound loses value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt Speculations on a short interest rate reduction from the Bank of England (BoE) to the pound Sterling. The UK currency was reduced by up to 0.4% on Friday to $1,2269.
Inspirators of sales were statements made by the banker Michael Saunder, which led to a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be turned aside, as the uncertainty would affect the UK economy at a later time. This statement was surprising, as Saunders considered itself a champion of a restrictive monetary policy, analyst Ricardo Evangelista of Brokerhaus ActivTrades said.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens on the economy due to the Brexit-Hickhack without directly signaling an interest rate reduction. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants his country to run out of the EU even without a divorce agreement on 31 October.

Doping: Further Russian Manipulations
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today's Chief of Integrity of the Athletics World Association.
In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out to be fake.
In December 2014, systematic fraud was revealed in Russian sports. During this period, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee, after an individual examination at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, had about 270 athletes in the country under neutral flag, with 168 Russian athletes at the start in February 2018. Also, at the World Cups in the various sports, they were allowed to attend the World Cups in the summer of Russia.
Positive findings are missing
In the following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada banner again, but requested access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide insight into the extent of hiding of doping balls during state doping. You should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the independent integrity commission (AIU) of the Athletics World Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data was manipulated from the Moscow analysis laboratory. “Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check if the task force has received the right data,” said David Howman in the interview of the “Frankfurter General Newspaper” of Friday. “We have found numerous discrepancys between the data that Wada has received from a whistleblower, and the one it received from the Russians in January, many positive findings that have been mentioned in the McLaren report.
The WM is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association holds as the only organization on the Ban of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and subject to tests.
At the beginning of this week, Wada had already put manipulations in the room and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the new barrier of the Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
