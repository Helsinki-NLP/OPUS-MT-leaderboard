Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An error-making institution where young people should meet today.
A pit chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now dug.
Small farmers manage the first cause of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It’s nervous when maps are not up-to-date.
This is what everyone who had to be excited about, because the car-navi instead of a surrounding road showed a green way.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bayern of the State Government, are anything but current, but very revealing.
Especially if you compare them to current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed since the 19th century in the Münchner Mercury area.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a flickentepich, which one does not recognize as such.
More detailed maps, so-called \"Urposition Sheets,\" were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bayerische Vermehrungsverwaltungsverwaltung, it was created between 1810 and 1864 and the first measurement of Bavaria.
Their clients: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: it was the present-day neighbors who created the idea of a surface-covering Bayern map.
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued to drive the project, founded the topographical agency, and thus the Bavarian measurement administration.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian Landesbibliothek.
The comparison of the former/now is the example of the capital of the country.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is subsendling, which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.
Sendling was formed 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, as a Münchener Stadtteil.
Today, Unsendling lies in the middle of the city.
The houses of Unsendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was first named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears on the back zoom: hand-numbered flurry pieces from the so-called “surces” from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer produce farmers - but small gardens of the plant - Land in the Sun -
A large green area is located north of the subsendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810, the scene of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a display in the 19th century, and not a concrete desert.
On the other hand, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original position sheet, in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district, you can read not only the street name \"at Gasteig\" or from the elevation \"On the airs\" but also in large letters \"Irren Stalt\"
Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, people were once locked up with insanity.
There, 1858/59, the Munich Kreis-Irrenansanstalt (On the Aushalt Ventungen) was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Guden led the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought about in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
“He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chain of so-called errors.
In addition, he has prohibited the staff from applying violence against the inmates, says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients, it was first spaced, and later it was expanded to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenansanstalt in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest therapists, has been located there.
In the area of the former branch of Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.
West lies the football spot of the TSV Munich East, eastern residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house \"Casa Don Bosco\" was built in architectural reference to the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed in World War II in bombing attacks.
The Marienplatz was recorded as the \"Main Square\" around 1856, which was called the \"Kaufinger Gasse\"
A decisive change in the Second World War also took place in the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes into the city centre.
A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a middle-aged pit chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the pre-work and on 5 April 2017 the spatstick for the second S-Bahn line are carried out.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared to the air image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group Releases Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for colourful people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
“The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is scheduled to enter into force until August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missouriers to pay special attention to travel through the State and to take extreme precautions, as a number of questionable racial-based incidents have recently occurred and are noted here,” said the group’s opinion.
A recently adopted law of Missouri that makes it harder for people to win discrimination charges, as well as the state’s law enforcement authorities, which aim disproportionately at minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
“They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed,” said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven’t heard yet.”
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances early in the year after he had no more gasoline during the trip by the state and was arrested by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report by Missouri Attorney-General’s Office, showing that black car drivers in the state are being stopped 75 percent more often than whites.
“The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be ready to bring bail money or let relatives know that they are traveling through the state.”
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which states are in respect of the number of such injuries to the country's 16th grade.
Travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws that required local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times, interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
The Weidezaun Project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU national day delegates Peter Witt and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the site.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his company, where he farmed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provided 40 milk cows and as many young animals, and housed in five apartments of holiday guests.
The “Black Forest Milk” is for him the alternative non-fertilization path for the milk of his cows, Schwendmann said.
On the table of holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he referred to the Weidezoon project as \"elementary important\"
I can’t be productive in such steep areas.
The Greenland area provides a lot of work, much has to be done with the motorsense.
“We have to deal with the conditions and the topography here,” Schwendmann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parenting business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even though he did not carry out any bio operations.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: “The community has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about the leadership.
The farmers had to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4,000 euros per hectares.
It is hoped that this will allow the up-to-date of the land to be pulled out for a while.
“The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their business,” said the mayor.
The farmers are often criticized for their support
A total of 25 parcels of 11 participants were added to the weidezaun promotion in 2013.
The opening area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of 71 500 euros, half was funded by leaders, one quarter carried the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers stayed for 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture.
“The great advantage is the durability of the fence,” said Schwendmann.
Kordula Kovac emphasized: “You’re doing a good job, without farmers and farmers, it’s not going to happen.”
Peter White also said: “Here are the best foods produced.
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows for the state promotion of pasture fences.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
Preferably, the presence of a conveyor-culette referred to by the LPR is a prerequisite.
In addition, the area which is tossed in must not be sloppy (hungry over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by foresting.
For the 2018 Fischerbacher Weidezaun project, the application is currently being made by eight participants with 24 parcels who want to build almost 16 kilometers of fence.
The opening area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now Trump's White House takes over the statue of freedom
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carelessly staged storm Saddam Hussein's place at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about President's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the statue of freedom.
To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitaters would have lied to him if he had done so.
But he took on its significance, and in particular the meaning that was attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller Acosta said: “I don’t want to go to a complete thing about history here, but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that lightes the world.
The poem you refer to that was later added and is not part of the original statue of freedom.
Miller is actually right, but as he himself put it, it’s not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance on the robbing words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: “Your tired, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who seek to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts”
There was never a time when the “bad waste” was seen better on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump’s USA.
This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural controversy: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.
Lazarus — and her friends, who were committed to putting their words at the base after her death — knew very well that she was carrying out a high-political action.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a used classical representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
The great shout of Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the statue of freedom does not invite anyone, but rather is an early neoconservative that will bring the American flame into the surrounding world: “Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is intended to carry the fackle of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.
The fackle is not intended to light the way to the United States.
Very unusual is Limbaugh here.
The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great fantasy act of Lazarus was to see them as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is in the truest sense about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they need to hear.
And of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would like to recognize.
Their fake is not to light the way, but to lighten the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two shots were part of the UK team.
United Kingdom’s athletics director Neil Black says that the 16-headed Scottish contingent in the World Championship Framework will make a massive contribution to the team.
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that “you’re developing something special in Scotland” and that the United Kingdom’s athletics must learn something from it.
“We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it out,” Black said.
“I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant.
Several of the Scottish athletes are medalists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will join Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was selected by the team captain.
“Eilidh is pretty modest.
Her captain's Red was incredible, says Black.
“A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in were of course great.
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will join the 400m hurdles at their fifth world championships, says that it is “unbelievable” that 16 shots are in the British team.
Scotland’s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which was reached in 1983 and 2015.
The centre-tracker Muir leads this way and has set five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shot to watch after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls her first world championships when the only other shot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is “an ordinary pride” on the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also join the medals and the finals.
“The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me,” she added.
“Of course, I am very proud of all the shots that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podies.
What is my speech as a captain?
Yes, I think she was going well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there.
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don’t apply for a public office if you can’t contract to hire voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scrambled at criticism, sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said, “The freedom of speech can be taken away, and, stupid and stupid, we will be like the sheep being led to slaughter.”
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of doing so early this week.
The governor's staff released the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with \"Na, and \".
“It’s just Facebook,” said many people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a type like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playfully debut his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's side - who is a public forum that is referred to as official and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing online the Petish.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people talking to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a parishioner, no troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profanous.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Law lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.
“I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news,” she wrote in the article’s comments “The Post.”
“I also don’t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are being despised by some rather than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens.
What the governor’s employees referred to as “concentrated spam attack,” others would probably call “for speech.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past, if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guiding articles or arrest demonstrators and silence them.
But that’s exactly what’s happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is accused by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question happened last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned an electorate from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable Porto had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers joined his leadership.
Even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as \"Juricola\" \"Valerius\" \"Belisarius\" and \"Portius\" all wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by George Washington Project's Online Papers.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led next year in the Archerfield Left to the final round before losing to Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and we saw how it achieved its fame with this event,” Rafferty said.
“The players will see this course from its best side, it’s in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he set up this place.
He is a zealous defender of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great show window for this course.
England’s Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
“That really feels special,” said the player in Southport.
“I couldn’t defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returned to action on home floor.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“It always means a little more when you play at home,” Orr said, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing it again, and I played a solid golf.
I’m happy about how it went,
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six shots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking lot costs £5 per car with an inmate and £10 per car with two or more inmates.

Less lung cancer deaths by passive smoke
In the past two decades, fewer people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoke.
As a result, scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) are in a study.
“We estimate that 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoke per year,” said study director Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew his own study on this topic from 1994.
At the time, there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smokes per year in Germany.
The new research was published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
The constructions in the Villinger Straße are in full operation and “begins in time” according to the head of the Fred Heinze Bauhof.
In the area of home connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as much is hidden in the underground, which is not noticed in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly interferes with construction work, represents a major problem for the company’s construction force.
“The ignorance of the motorists in front of red amphitheaters and shut-off grids is already enormous,” says Heinze.
The road is closed and only the buses are entitled to travel.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
“The hot days were very tough.
But fortunately, we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt, who told Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei buys dinner, she does not use a herd.
It only rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potatoes - locally referred to as “nota” - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the cooled knot is removed and swallowed with zealous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, e.g. washing clothes with dry water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned a field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late working can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
“No one dares walk around the village after 17 o’clock,” she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was taken up in Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public hand survey before the occupation forces.
An existing movement that sparked independence against the Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent section of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is oede. The trip involves a 90-minute flight from Jayapura Province Capital to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive with the car hire.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and of well-plated roofs transformed into various yellow brown tones by rust.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here, so avoid journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes too.
“We were not used to wearing this clothing,” says Degei, referring to her vivid hand woven turban, her dark shirt, and her bright skirt.
“In the past, we had only leaves on our bodies.
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
It is also Indonesia’s goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grassberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015, Freeport reduced gold and copper by $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for Papua, which ensures that Indonesia’s powerful military retains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 survey in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military nationals and units almost $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated without compassion.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highland in the 1970s were committed in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission on genocide.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
“We will lose everything,” says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which contains reports of the previous year’s violence, such as illegal executions and tortures - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal cancellation of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia’s researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened as Papua’s resources bring an inflow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the population-rich islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warning cantins sell breaded chicken and God-goddess, a mixed vegetable with peanut sauce served.
Local people are fighting to keep up with this.
“The migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai resident who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura.
\"It has cost the native Papua - the Mama-Mama [the Women] of Papua - their market.\"
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known in popular as Yokowi, promised to address the inequality and violations of law in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former mayor secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the President's Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua, little has changed, and today the locals feel cheated.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Yokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored,” You says.
In fact, Paniai only suffered two months after Yokowi’s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out singing Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk chased and hit the group with their rifle pistons, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of the children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football spot in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting arches and led the Waita dance - in the circle running and a bird singing imitating - from Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began to drag stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated up, a command was sent to the soldier via an internal radio: “If the masses make more than three times resist, they will shoot them dead,” says an official document by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
“When I turned, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist,” he said on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
“It was overcrowded, many shots were fired,” he added.
The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin was the witness of the shootings.
“I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was,” said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, only bears a name, the TIME in a dark mood.
\"I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him.\"
The chief inspector of Papuan police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers just wanted to \"safe\" their station because it was being attacked.
“We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said Papuan spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
“It’s about life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many others injured.
The news about the killings only came the next day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
For three weeks, Yokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to tackle the historical wrongs in Papua.
“I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it won’t happen again in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he had set up an extrajudicial mechanism to remedy historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
“Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed to address these violations, but there are processes that must be carried out,” he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME on June 5 in Jakarta and said he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “everything is regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, who has been charged by the UN for \"criminal crimes against humanity\", who claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote of 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been filed, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such allegations with grim incredulity.
“I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress,” Yohanes says.
\"I'm tired.\"
He says he still lives in fear years later.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
\"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot.\"
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
“After I had buried the bodies, the military searched for me,” he says.
The shootings didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Town dwellers protested in front of the company's location office.
Police said the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning committees.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killed one.
“We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge,” says Domingu Badii, 29-year-old, who lives near the hospital and was a witness to how the injured were quickly delivered here, the TIME said.
“I’ve been hiding in my house for two days.
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers involved to take account of them and withdraw the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always a troublemaker for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the \"Free Papua Movement\" (OPM), the rebel army claiming to defend Papua's rights by triggering sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested in recent years and taken into account voluntarily, under the premeditation of the “revocation of national sovereignty”
Some never appear again.
Paniai is known among people in Papua as “a tragic, forgotten place.”
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here build on everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of notes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality between the native Papuan and the new migrants has increased since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better trained and more prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary skills to run their own companies competitively.
“The young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are no jobs or money here,” says John Gobai, president of Paniai’s tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting continue to be stressed by international media.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua due to lack of coordination with related institutions, although the rare permission was given to film them.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Yokowi's election campaign to lift the reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development were not realized.
“There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia’s most restful eastern provinces of Papua and Westpapua: Visa refusal and a black list,” he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighboring state of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the \"disrupted and widespread injuries\" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group’s allegations and said, “In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it’s difficult to hide the evidence of human rights cases.”
People on site want more foreign governments to take notice of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and pressured him “We want freedom,” according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua says they will probably not vote for Yokowi again.
\"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Paniai shootings,\" said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Yokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a robber military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuas, view their voice for Yokowi as a “indecent debt” he has to pay back.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and horrors, families of the Paniai shooting victims performed a last symbolic act of spite: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never come to justice, but at least they do not let the responsible ones forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” says Yacobus with a low head.
“What else can we do?”
Fire captures Dubai's 'Torch' cloud crater for the second time
A fire was found on Friday in one of the world’s tallest living towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-foot-high, 79-story buildings.
It is the second fire that fights through the high house in just two years, which is by chance called the torch tower.
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
“We have slept and we have risen in the fire alarm and in the cry of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor - a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire control at 4:00 a.m. local time (00.00 a.m. GMT) extinguished the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing accommodations for the affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high houses around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the clothing, the outer clothing for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believe that the system of records for insulation and clothing at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has passed its major Davis Cup Cup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, for this sport, the revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-seat classics, which are often very long, but also very much appreciated, are therefore kept in the traditional application.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted for reform, so ITF President David Haggerty’s goal was barely missed.
“We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions, Haggerty said.
You will continue to work to improve the applications.
It was not until the vote that, after many allegations, the proposal had already come to bring the finals to a neutral place.
As of 2018, there are only relatively small details: so the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the following year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs of the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places, etc., will be easier and players will have to complete less official media terminals before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 of 5 U.S. travelers bring banned items to the plane, find out a survey
A survey of flight passengers found that more than 20 percent of unconscious or unconsciously prohibited objects at the US Transportation Security Administration's checkpoints were smuggling past, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while carrying accidentally banned knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had lately discovered that they had been traveling improperly with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet chart service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers are more likely to disregard the rules.
Of those surveyed who admitted that they were knowingly trying to fly with something forbidden by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately pasted to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3% admitted to knowingly carrying products with blade through safety control, while 2.2 percent of female surveyors and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs to the plane.
The company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggling goods through airport safety and how many would have done it deliberately.
It’s no surprise that the people who carry the most common smuggling goods — knowingly or unknowingly — by safety were those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure which liquids they can take or how much of it.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the largest amount of TSA-captured objects are prohibited.
For a time, people thought that TSA could view books as smuggling.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order
Elon Musk is pleased to announce with the huge number of preorders for his new Tesla \"Model 3\".
He has thus far concluded that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-trumphal figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla chief Elon Musk has first betrayed another less brilliant number in the announcement of the latest quarter balance: those of the disabled in the new mass market model 3.
In recent months Musk has often purchased the more than 500,000 preorders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Musk now boasts: 63,000 have already been withdrawn from the total of 518.000 preorders.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In a refund, Tesla will pay the 1,000 euros (in the US $1,000 and in the UK 1000 pounds) reservation payment.
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding reservations lie ahead, Musk entered into a telephone conference with analysts.
That the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could be a problem to date does not believe the Tesla chief.
His argument: The challenge to ambitious growth goals is not the demand but the production side.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, all models are to be combined - 500,000, 2020, one million.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Those who order a \"model 3\" today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its nail-new, never-tested production roads in practice without a maximum interruption.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if it comes to greater delays, then the unboundability of the reservations could become the problem for Tesla.
Because then, the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running in pairs.
EPA Chief Pruitt withdraws from emissions due to the delay of Obama-era rules
One day after being charged by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the Chief of Environmental Protection Authority, took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama era’s rules in order to reduce emissions of smog-related air pollution.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved to be the needs of the state environmental authorities to respond more quickly than previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint that had been filed against his previous position in a federal court of appeal.
It is about a deadline that was set out for States on 1 October to comply with the standards of 2015 for bottom-of-the-oil zones.
Pruitt announced in June that he will delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid \"misusing himself in local decisions or hindering economic growth\"
Pruitt, who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was a trusted opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry.
The sudden return of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal court in Washington ruled that the EPA manager had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turnaround at Ozone Standards simply strengthened the EPO's willingness to cooperate with the States through the complex process of the timely fulfillment of the new standards.
“Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with the terms of implementation and then is waiting to be charged by activist groups and others, and, in an agreement, to set the date for implementation,” said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We don’t believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take time limits seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority that exists to us.
However, the EPA's opinion stated that Pruitt will use its \"authority to delay and all other legally available powers\" at some point to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best information available.
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive resumption of the ozone rules.
A legislation approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had accused the EPA this week, said the group was planning to maintain legal pressure.
“The conversion of the EPA, according to our complaints, is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities,” Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground-Ozone occurs when harmful substances from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Representatives of public health and environmental protection cheered over Pruitt's surprising change of course.
“It’s disturbing how much pressure it takes to take this reasonable step by the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight against Trump’s ideological Crusade, offering ourselves to environmental pollutants and their special interests.
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 16.30 p.m. to a serenade.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the township, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building on site have made the friends and promoters of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini points out: “It is a unique permanent littleod.
In 1267, the St. Hilariucappelle was first mentioned in the Württemberger Urkundenbuch: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold “the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogtei” to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
According to the text of the decree, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a ruling court to which the church or the patronage law belonged and did not vice versa.
So there were people there too.
As the description of the Oberamte Joyenstadt of 1858 shows, in addition to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which can be seen today in the town of Tumlingen, the \"mountain\" was the third, the village's dominant settlement center.
Old maps from around the year 1600 underwall these historical events.
The patronage law was based on ancient church law.
A Lord, who built, equipped, and occupied a church with a parishioner, remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit it as well.
It was associated with the right to set up a parishioner or to propose a new parishioner to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The greater of the two broke up on Christmas 1673.
The newly opened bell first appeared in 1692, but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616-1648), the window discs were struck and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was dark.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the candles and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the Church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from earwear.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Just let the church tower stand.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was broken down.
Only the tower-drying tower still exists today as a witness to 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are taking care of the Hilarius plant as successors to Dieter Dockhorn.
As an organizer, the friends and promoters invite Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery to St. Hilariucappelle.
It is formed by the Combo of Kepler High School's Joy City and by the contributions of Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Ortsvorsteher Hartmut Romanen speaks the ending word.
The program starts at 16.30 p.m.
Inlet is from 15.30 p.m.
For the sound of the serenade, an umdrunk takes place in front of the cemetery.
“Take a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view of the meadows towards the forest, the organizers take out the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of importance to tumbles and hearings.
The friends and promoter of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini notes.
Association aims to review approval of windwheels
\"Boisheim resists - sees no legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
The association “Boisheim defends itself” has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer nets.
It is illegal.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind power plants could have been approved in the Boisheimer nets, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border at Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind energy plants are basically possible, but at the same time, the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city area.
These zones are intended to prevent a “reparation” of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided on a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer net a few days earlier by a change in the area use plan, it had not been approved by the Düsseldorf district government for a form failure.
In view of the lack of planning legal requirement, the granted approval decision is still illegal and therefore also rescind it,” said Christoph Erkens, chairman of Boisheim.
Current state of things: Before the summer break, the city council decided again on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer nets; an approval of the district government is still standing.
Recognising: “This means that at this point the granting of a permit for the establishment of wind power plants is excluded from planning law.
The circuit confirms the entrance of the request.
“The corresponding letters have been in the district of Viersen since the past week,” a spokesperson said.
The circuit takes it to the occasion to review the matter again.
However, they probably do not cause the procedure to stop.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, on Thursday the circuit did not want to express itself content for the argumentation of the association “Boisheim resists”.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans on an area on the Boisheimer net to build four 200 meters high windwheels each.
As early as last year, the company in which the city of Viersen is directly involved had signed a contract with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large land.
With the establishment of the four wind power plants, the power demand of around 11 400 households is to be increased - which corresponds to around a fifth of the power demand of all four-ssen households.
The New Re wants to invest around €20 million.
Last summer, Viersen’s City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind power plants in the Windpark Linnich near Aachen and a participation in a wind power plant in Buchach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor cracked together: woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Lower Wallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two more people were easily injured.
The state road remained closed for hours.
According to police data, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich, with her car, accompanied by her 53-year-old mother, drove the L 333 towards Bogel.
Planning a city and dealer - Home Shops - Weekend
Bad Langensaltaer and people from the region are planning to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The Commercial Association and the City Administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the residents into the downtown shopping pool.
As the President of the Commercial Association, Christian König, announced, the Home Shopping Weekend will make customers more sensitive to what offers the city offers apart from the usual supermarket ware.
So planned is a market with regional providers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies should present themselves with their training sites.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to be invited to the “Mitt night shopping”.
The action not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearest region.
In preparation, advertisers are on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend end, according to Christian King.
City administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
With this, the Commercial Association and the City go into a further stage of the project - attractive city centre -
These include new offers such as the first “Activ Day” at the Fountain, as well as open Sundays, conversations with all businessmen and managers to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the absence of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials are to be re-opened or re-opened.
These include tourists and tourists.
But also many locals had lost the city centre when shopping out of sight.
In the end, everyone had to contribute to the city center - up to tenants, the businesses of the whole city and associations.
It was possible to overcome the Lethargy, which had partially spread, with a network, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that on the third “home shopping” day, five Thuringian cities were involved for the first time.
In addition to Bad Langensalta, these are Weimar, Summerda, Saint City and Bleicherode.
The day is “representing for the appreciation of local trade and exposing its importance to the public welfare of our cities,” the report said.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also made it clear that every citizen can influence his or her own immediate environment with his or her buying behavior.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. School
During construction work, a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others injured, some of them seriously.
According to the firefighter, on Wednesday (local time) another injured was in critical condition.
A person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A first missing man was later also saved.
The dead were school employees.
As an accident, authorities suspected working on a gas line.
At the time of the holiday, only a few people stayed in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump put pressure on Mexico for the payment of the border walls after unscathed transcripts of phone calls
Transcriptions of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop public saying he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president humiliated him because he had publicly approached the wall, and he said to him, “You can’t say that to the press.”
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and vowed to pay Mexico for the project.
Transcriptions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the United States refugees who emigrated to Australia would be \"laughingly \"mes\" and \"dump\" and that the existence on the trade entrusted by the Obama government would make him look like a \"depp\" after he proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said Mr. Turnbull, \"This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day.\"
Moore's Ford massacre: Activists re-run racist lynchact as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury led by a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns emerged to block its way.
The leader of the mob - a man of middle age in a needle strip suit - took a long train at his gigar and looked at through the windscreen.
In the middle, the inmates swung into fear.
\"We want this n--r Roger--brought the man.
“Keep him out of the car.”
The silence was torn when a young black man was torn from the driver's seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is only a follow-up.
But when a blade is thrown around the neck of \"Roger\", almost everyone in the audience gets very real soaps.
Since 2005, civil rights officers have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to follow the night in which two black couples — Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey — were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with murder.
“It’s really indescribable that in all these years no person has been arrested, even though we see them in our communities, though we know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who assists in organizing the post.
“It’s a dirty spot on a story, but it’s a burden to our souls.
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a life-long civil rights officer.
For him, the revocation serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
“We want prosecution, we want the termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he said.
“We cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.”
A court physician lays a bed towel over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch trial.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained free-footed for decades, civil lawyers say that the dual motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time during the pre-election campaign in summer.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom had a white landowner, Barnett Hester, down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city had been that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was wearing was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they got away from the prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
“As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murder,” an FBI report concluded.
\"It is also obvious that there was a dispute between the state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence and confused the identity of witnesses.\"
Brooks makes it even more pregnant.
“It was a right-wing massacre,” he said.
\"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: \"If you can register and if you vote, then this will happen to you here.\"
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene led the annual performance of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Her presentation is vivid, engaging and is based in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
“We don’t want to talk about Lynch because we are then confronted with its uglyness in all of us,” she said.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t want to listen to me or listen to what I’ve been through.”
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors — a dozen whites and the rest of Blacks — pushed into a room and noised when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is a green co-director here.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
“I feel dirty because I’m not that way,” Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to return at these times.”
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom yelling at Hester and threatening him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
“I said, n --- he, disappeared from my property.”
Rascona rescues the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks into laughter.
Greene laughs loudest.
“What?” asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
“No,” Greene said, still kicking.
“I just don’t think that white people said a --- he’d say,” he said.
“Yeah,” one of the other black performers whispered.
\"You just have to meet the hard 'R'.\"
And right there, the energy in the room shifts, a feeling of companionship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and with emphasis.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman dressed in a mournful dress stands over the body of the actors and performs Billie Holiday’s mournful praise “Strang Fruit”.
Your voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred meters later, a group of about four dozen spectators waved sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost uniformly divided between black and white.
A couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have experienced Georgia’s pressing moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the graveyards of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spensy.
When the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children hook up at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
“They’re not really dead,” a little boy mutters, as if he wanted to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the amount - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his players and then breaks into her arms weeping together, the emotional burden of performance finally breaks with him.
\"It's okay - whispering one of the women.
“We know that this is not in your heart.
You have done this for one reason -
Later, the audience joins the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta are excited about the post with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance behind.
“It’s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... from people who look like you and do it yourself because they look like you,” she said.
“What this really does to me makes me believe that Lynch is still going on,” she added, “this is called just police shooting.”
In the same room, Tyrone keeps Brook's court at his table, he eats and remembers the civil rights.
He said he was already starting to plan the performance next year.
“The post is inspiring in some way because it describes the fears of what we have endured, but it’s also a moment of learning,” he said.
“It’s that if we don’t learn from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat them.
\"Göttämmerung - reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf focuses on a colorfully frivolous scene in front of a gigantic, six-story sculpture.
The rotational stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner with wall remnants and dönerbude in Berlin, a \"Plaste and Elaste\" logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Prior to that, an open Mercedes oldtimer parked in which the Rhine daughters pose as rockergirls, or, as an alternative, an isetta.
Stacked oil ingredients remind of Castorf's guiding motif - money, power and greed - which attracts itself through its \"ring\" setting.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lemmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as already in the “Rheingold” wonderful.
Kess seduces them Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), tearing a body into the suitcase in Hollywood manner and giving the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the magnificently fiancée that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beats Siegfried.
He also had to believe Gunther (Mark Eiche).
The audience thanks the ensemble with a loud applause.
Stormy celebrations are celebrated by Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who modestly bows hands to Merkel-Raute.
There is great acclaim for the festival orchestra, which is shown on stage for the first time - given the great heat back in lower leisure clothing.
The performance was expected by Frank Castorf and his team of directors.
Had he had to have a valid pipe concert in 2013, there was great cheer five years later, in which the single \"Buh\" Rufe went down.
Major Katharina Wagner may have been pleased with this.
“It has been noted that the public has grown together with the ring in some way,” she said shortly before the DPA’s performance.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it was also an understanding of its point of view.
I draw a positive resume.
Max Mass works as a volunteer
They work the same way in several places during their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Mass: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture shop, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I also worked at the school all day.
How are your experiences with it?
Lots: It's a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years old, so a late-level volunteer.
How are you?
Lots: I did abitur.
And then a construction engineering study, let's say, successfully quit.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself what you're doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on site, in the focal point maybe, too.
And was it so?
Amount: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in socialism in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, probably doing a social worker training at the Herne Youth Office and studying in Hamm at the specialist college.
Is it not unusual to have several different places of use during volunteer service?
Amount: Yes, it is very variable.
It’s always on where you make your FSJ.
It can be done from the old age home to youth work - in all possible fields of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also part of the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Unlike in construction engineering studies?
Amount: After all, this is not about calculating statics.
We have people in our heads who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been taken out of the family, must always be contacted individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any touches?
Mass: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that has a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that’s how life is.
Pearson shortens another 3,000 jobs and shortens the dividend to revitalize the business
The British Education Group Pearson said on Friday that it will cut down another 3,000 jobs and cut its dividend by 72 percent, as a further restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is confronted.
The job loss, announced by Director-General John Fallon mostly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, is in addition to its previous restructuring, in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost.
Pearson announced in May in a third cost reduction program a plan to reduce costs by another $300 million (394 million) to revitalize a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which had sold its share of Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it reached an increase of 1% to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
The Battle of Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide
A suicide killer has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and hurting several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a NATO statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports also killed three civilians in the Qarabagh area.
The bombing is the last violent attack that Afghanistan hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide killer killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to a NATO opinion, the explosion took place on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an “improvised explosive rate” carried by people.
The statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since the U.S.-led troops forced the Taliban to surrender power in 2001.
The violence underscores Afghanistan’s precise security situation, as U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicides in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government, their policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA turns to a decision to delay the smog rule after complaints
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has lifted a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama government, which states are obliged to stop smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states have charged the agency for the move.
On Wednesday, the EPA announced the decision to advance the so-called “Ozone Regulations 2015” and said it would show the agency’s commitment to work with states.
“We believe in the dialogue with and at the same time that we are responding to our state partners,” said EPA chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA’s intention to meet the ozone regulations - in which, in part of the country, pollution emissions are to be measured to determine where cuts must be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday saying that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s government has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that, according to Trump, is to boost economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered the backlash of Democrats and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that inhaling air containing Ozone can reduce lung function and strengthen breathing symptoms, such as asthma.
the Community Council on Community Space
In the end, the decision was clear: The Community Council of Fluorine-Winzels decided to set up a community space in the future senior housing system.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing property part has been signed, says Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will take a long time for the church community to be a part of the community, there is no longer a planning barrier to the project to be agreed upon by a private investor.
There is a discussion on a Community area for this.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square meters for a special price.
The administration and majority of the municipal council intend to provide such a community area not only as a meeting place for the residents of the senior-right residence, but also open to the community.
As an example, the word of the “strick café” made the round.
The decision, which has already been preceded by the provision of funds for the current budget in the past fall, will be delayed by funding opportunities.
The building is located in the refurbishment area.
The establishment of a Community space would, according to Tjaden, be eligible by 60 percent of 30%.
The decision is to signal to the investor that in this respect, he does not want to throw a button between the legs, stating that both the saddle - which is borrowed from the environment construction - and the pult roof - would be possible which reduces the height of the tear and makes the construction economic - possible.
Not only does Wilfried Sohmer mean this addition.
If it helps, it will happen unanimously to the body.
It is not that easy in the Community.
Daniela’s reputation refers to the many buildings with which you don’t get so far ahead, for this reason you now lean out of the window in the community room, she says, “I’m doing hard with it.”
Yvonne Staiger speaks out for the Community — but absolutely against a community participation.
After that, she sees a hidden grant to any assets or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area, there is no grant, but it is the opposite of a real counter-value that can be marketed in case of doubt.
Staiger's request to split the decision accordingly finds three advocates.
So it remains with two voices in the original programme, which Stefan Haller sums up in this way: “If we make the decision, we’ll take a huge step toward closing a huge gap in our infrastructure.”
Collision by car: Radler is being hit on the street
When crossing the street, an 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car on Wednesday in Garath and seriously injured.
As police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on his bike on the Black Road road from Hilden at 12.20 p.m.
The senior wanted to cross the highway at the height of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A truck driver driving in the same direction granted him priority.
When the long fields were on the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic.
He joined a car that was driving a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was dragged to the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital by a rescue car.
FC Bayern Munich must reject David Alaba and Thiago at the Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba must have the game played against Dortmund.
With staffing services, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Pocal Winner.
The staff services at the German football record champion Bayern Munich will be growing more and more before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 a.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokal Winner Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also give up David Alaba in duell with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, the Munichers Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches, Ancelotti has been responsible for the physical condition and lack of balance in the game of his team.
“We know we’re not in the best physical constitution,” Ancelotti said, adding: “The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good at the last -
However, the 58-year-old believes in a performance increase in the first official duty game of the season.
“Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The team is ready.
“We want to play intelligently,” Ancelotti said, expecting a “hard, intense game.”
The duel of the two German football heavyweights attracts the fans in their bans.
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Wander in the Harz from Star to Star
In the resin, the first “star path” is to be created.
This is planned by the Association Sternwarte Saint Andreasberg.
There is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A “star path” comes to meet the information needs of many resin-visitors, it was called.
It connects nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
Members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans \"well-reached installations in five to six locations\" in Oberharz.
Inquiry came St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hooggieitz and Sieber.
The information on the tables should be complemented by the Internet.
This is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in location selection.
Freedom of barriers is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Path train will be extended by train.
“On the star path, the viewers experience a lot of knowledge, for example, about the physics of the individual stars,” the association said.
In addition, they learned why stars had different colors or why a star shines stronger than another, even though it lay substantially farther away.
It is also mediated in which constellation there is a selected star and when it is best to see.
Since 2014 the association has been operating in the Bergstädtchen St. Andreasberg, the highest-lying Sternwarte Norddeutsche Landes.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Protection, the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is among the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often from there the Milky Way and even the Andorra galaxy with a mere eye can be seen clearly.
Since 2003 there has been something similar to the planned Star Wars in the Planetarium Göttingen.
Starting in front of Gebhard’s hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet’s path leads up to the Hainberg and to the Starguard, as well as a “outer Earth” location in Diemarden (commonly equal) with the planet Sedna.
The steels with the individual planets, including Pluto downgraded at the end point, are set exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimetres in diameter, while the sun, which is just 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour up to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in the world.
The march to the next fix star, however, would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federweight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five Pound-for Pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, “How are you, champion?
I wish you a lot of luck.
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 19 p.m. on ESPN.
When the pair posted for photos, Lomachenko manager Egi’s climates noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the “perfect order of magnitude.”
\"I'm a former spring weight - remember Garcia.
“I’ve risen for Broner [up to 140 pounds] but I’m not that big.
I am small for 140.
I want to get down on lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans need.
Let us give them that.
Lomachenko agreed.
\"Boxing needs this fight.\"
Climates asked whether it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree with Garcia a date (37-0, 30 knockouts) that also has an interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on September 23.
“This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans were asking for it,” Garcia said and later expressed himself openly to fight on the network offering the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other name can produce this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready...
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as “an enormous fighter” and he may be participating in his Saturday campaign.
But Lomachenko held on to the generous praise for Garcia and said he thought that the three-fighting champion from Riverside saw \"very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out.\"
Garcia said the focus was to show stroke strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum built up for their own fight.
“This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it, Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, “I’ve been waiting for the top fighters, and that’s Mikey.
It will be a great fight.
Four injured by tyre pitchers
In case of an A7 accident, four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 16.30 a.m. just before the connecting station market width probably after a tyre pitcher.
The truck slid right into the bosom, where it crossed and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates — two adults and two children — were partially seriously injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour, after which traffic on the left line could be passed to the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: “Dreider chain works better -
After 2:2am, Andre Hoffmann hopes for the season-off against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defence formation will bring points to the attention.
With the first season game, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result too, there would not have been the two opponents at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
“These were two opposites too much, and we need to be even better on our watch,” says the defense player of Fortune Düsseldorf.
In the first row, the three chain should also be further optimized.
And a gate after a release no longer wants to capture the fortunes.
“For the future it will be so that no one will put himself next to Michael (Rensing) on the line.
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will also better cope with the three chain after the experience in preparation, than with the four chain.
“I still don’t know how we’ll act in the eye,” says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann’s case is certain, “because we have players in the three chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well,” Hoffmann said.
“Preposition is, but that we are even better at harmonizing and we do not make so many mistakes in building.”
Hoffmann, of course, also rides to Aue to win the game.
“But if you can talk about a missing start after a disagreement, you don’t know.
The performance could be okay, Hoffmann said.
“But if we stand there on Sunday with four points and can focus on the pokal, we will certainly be able to talk about a decent season break-up.”
His coach didn't want to know about it.
“I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of play,” said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn’t want to talk about an advantage to Aue, just because the Sachsen’s game in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a storm.
“Now they can start the season with a home game,” said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the players from the eye might even be a little bit freshr as they had no heavy and complete game like Fortune against a rise-favorites in the bones.
“But they don’t know as much as 100 percent where they are currently,” says the interior defender of the Fortune.
Although the guests from the Rhineland as a light favourite on Sunday go to the meeting in the final (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
“That we fight them away, just because we have the right to get under the first six, is stupid,” says Funkel, whose balance sheet is very positive in just one defeat against the eye from nine games.
“There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start,” explains Fortune’s head coach.
“To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant.”
And so Funkel doesn’t want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new medical assessment method of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years old, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish authority for forensic medicine (Rättsmedicalverket) began conducting the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Authority (migration chain) has been criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migration Verket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were considered 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the forensic Medicine Agency noted that the person was “possibly 18 years of age or older.”
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is “possibly under the age of 18”
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson from the forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been stable in recent months.
“We see no big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are quite constant,” he said in The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was considered over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum applicant lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases, the \"provisions that the person surveyed was 18 years of age or older.\"
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results published in 581, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-ray recordings of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the type of measurement should be used.
Judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say it for sure, we shouldn’t do it as if we could,” he told the newspaper Metro.
However, Göransson from the forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is that if the person is barely under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent.
Fully in the Plan
The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well ahead.
On Wednesday, a seven ton heavy concrete part on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach was installed.
“We’re very good at the time, it’s running super,” says Reinhold Licht, head of construction at the Streets and Transport Department in the Freiburg Government Bureau.
In April the work began at the same time on all three necessary bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The construction end is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the schedule is maintained.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a arched arch made of concrete that is coated with red buntsandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and safety of transport, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are built of red buntsandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the town entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30-foot-wide and seven-ton heavy so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is an edge fastening which is also used as an operating road.
On the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20-foot-wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian will walk on it.
In particular, this is a finished part, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps.
Special fingertip feeling has required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fiber cable to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed in advance of the work by handsetl about the project.
In addition, fish and cancer had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building building and the assembly hall in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is arranged one-way through an ampel.
For construction on the bridge at Lauterbacher Ortseingang, the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels - Tannenhof - and - Seven Linden - is completely closed.
The cost of the three bridge repairs is 700 000 euros together.
It is funded by the whole country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bonner Protest at German potato salad
It doesn’t happen so often that parties are drawn to a strand, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AFD), it comes together, which is otherwise only hard to bring under a hat.
The parties represented by the Volcano Eifel (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag this day because the AfD in the Gerolstein city hall invites Rondell to the \"large election campaign launch\" according to poster.
And well-known names start - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24, and the deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on-site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD students, but demonstrate them.
The motto “The Eifel Stays Colorful”
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto “All on a table” on the fountain site, but now takes place on the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the town hall.
A colorful picture that offers itself there.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of Forums A world and one of the leading organizers, is really happy: “Toll how many people came together here”
There is music and plenty of food, including a “Ur German potato salad that could also eat the AfD easily,” says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the train station, which is just a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD Vulcaneifel reports that he has tried such an event and got the extras.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in down, but there was an abduction because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes that there were not enough parking spaces available.
So now the Rondell, Hompes, is pleased that “we can have such a beautiful event here”
Looking at the event at the Rondell Square, he says: “This is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful.
This is also true: By 20 p.m., a band of entertainment takes place at the Rondell Square, in the city hall of various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD Chairman Uwe Junge.
At the hall are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate to hold their talks for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal chairman Beatrix von Storch.
Unchanging is the police presence, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour will take the AfD event, the guests on the front site have a longer breath, but also there is a clean up shortly after 21 a.m.
Police can stop - no special incidents.
Posaune meets trumpet
A rehearsing with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli is available in the series of Haslager Monastery Concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 o'clock in the monastery church.
Together with Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto \"Black Sea meets Black Forest - or \"Balkanvollore\" - on a classic German training with roots in the blast music.
Both soloists are winners and prize winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter at the renowned concert building Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the solo posaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both unite the desire not only to exceed the limits on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Johann Sebastian Bach explains to the two of them, as in a new wall, Daniel Schnyder's world music, combined with Bulgarian folklore, and in the \"Exchange Suite\" of jazz award-winning Nils Wogram, blends classical, jazz and free play into a fascinating overall artwork.
This core piece of the program was first launched this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it for the two musicians and more: The Haslager Klosterkirche with her special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything — so Kristen Stewart is open about her bisexuality.
“When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, ‘Oh, that was cool, what comes next?’”
The most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was that of their “Twilight” colleague Robert Pattinson, who ultimately became bitter.
Despite all of this, the browned performer assures the “Harper’s Bazaar magazine: “I was deeply in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I would have played it?
After her separation, Christians admitted that she was bisexual: “I have always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
It has never confused or hindered me.
I never thought I would be taken seriously.
In particular, she suffered from “Bang Showbiz” but during school time when she preferred to dress like a bub: “Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me very much.
When I was eleven, the kids told me, I would look like a bub.
I really felt attacked, scared, and embarrassed.
Now I look back and think, 'Mothers, be proud of you!'
Especially to the public, they don’t like their love life: “People expect you to behave in a certain way, and that irritates me.
And maybe some may call me ungrateful, but I don’t like to justify myself to the whole public.
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening at a announcement with President Trump that he will change the party.
Whether you like it or not, Democrats have distanced themselves from me, Governor Justice said.
“Today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as a West Virginia resident, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor.
The announcement broke out in cheer.
“I will change my registration to Republicans tomorrow,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say it’s time to play another game.”
Mr. Trump had previously promised a major announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes states that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee made a statement on Thursday evening, saying: “ Governor Justice’s party change is another blow for a Democratic party that would hinder us rather than work to make our country great again.”
“With only 15 governorates and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive, ending message,” RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe praises “honest” Russian apologies for doping scandal
The world's chief of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised what he described as a public apology from Russia to a doping scandal on Thursday, but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be re-entered into the sport.
Russia's Athletics Chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the Athletics World Championships that the banning of his country from sports was correct and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said he was sorry for “all athletes who were kicked away at competitions of gold and silver medals.”
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found indications of state-funded doping in Russia.
“I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized by itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned.”
Coe said he was also \"happy\" about Russia accepting the criteria for its re-entry.
“I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress was achieved, but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re-enter Russia,” Coe said.
“We have to do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system - he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will join the Athletics World Championships starting in London on Friday, following the strict IAAF criteria as neutral players.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for a re-position.
Drug testing is still inadequate and prohibited coaches are still working freely, he said reporters in London after a talk at the IAAF Council.
Act of mourning for soldiers disbanded in Mali
At a mourn celebration in northern Hessian Fritzlar, about 1,000 people of the two were killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high safety precautions.
For the still unexplained crash, Defense Minister Ursula said nothing about the Leyen (CDU).
But she referred to the two deceased pilots as \"Kinner of her trade\"
“We are proud of the highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany,” she said.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old chief of staff from North Westphalia were killed on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Their sarges were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlar Cathedral of Saint Peter on Thursday by a death watch of the Bundeswehr.
At lunchtime, only members of the church took their leave.
After that, the mourning celebration began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politics.
Among these were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector-General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Mourning guests laid down roses, the members were poor in arm on the sarges.
Before the church, Fritzlarers and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas.
Defense minister of the Leyen described the killed soldiers as \"highly decorated\" and used experience.
The chief of staff has built up the flight operation of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and has been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Also, Volker Bauersachs, commander of the Regiment to which the soldiers belonged, declared: “If this crew could not turn down the crash, then no one could have been able to do so.”
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the minister of the Leyen: the use was dangerous.
But he is also of high importance — for a country from which we are only separated by two states — she said.
After the celebration of mourning, the sores were brought out of the dome.
When and where they are buried, the Federal Army did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik does not want a tomb next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced to the King's House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are bequeathed to the Roskilde Cathedral.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already produced a sarcophage for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband’s decision, and it was further in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, it is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be in his French home.
Prince Henrik never made a heck of it that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife, Margrethe, was crowned king in 1972.
In 2016, he retired and also released the title “Prinzgeahl”.
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted, he did not consider himself equal to his wife - not even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokesperson of the Danish Royal House.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will be final, it is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be held in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French nobleman, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked on the theme in the French Embassy.
During his later wife's sympathies of the people always flown, Prince Henrik had a difficult standing with the Danes in his nearly 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik said over the first few years in Denmark: “A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk bars instead of strip socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tabak and who had the reputation of being the brand of socially-critical intellectual, I couldn’t hope for caution.
I was different.
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed of myself.
These were two mistakes.
Prime Minister Weil wants fast re-election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green majority of government for a quick re-election of the country's day, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday, he spoke out for the resolution of Parliament.
In the past, the surprising exit of a Greens detainee from her country-day group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official appointment of the Landtag election, the Red-Green Coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Greens deputy Elke Twesten founded her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
“I see my political future in the CDU,” she said on Friday in Hanover.
CDU Group Chief Björn Tümler wants to recommend that his group take them.
Thus, CDU and FDP together had 69 seats in the low-Saxon country day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on January 14 next year.
Tümler said the red-green country government must now decide whether it can continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
However, Stephan Weil believes it is essential that the day of the country will decide its self-resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on Tuesday on its further action.
The National Constitution also provides for the possibility of the country's day to withdraw from the Prime Minister's trust and elect a successor.
“Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be verified legally,” said Tümler.
“You’ll discuss all the questions calmly if they’re legally fair-checked.”
Tümler called Twesten's step \"but something Kurios\"
The politician himself stressed: “I am not a traitor.
I feel very good -
She called herself a follower of black-green.
The Greens called on the late MPs to withdraw their land day mandate.
“Of course, we assume that she will give back her country-day mandate, which she has received over the green country list, with immediate effect,” state-chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner told.
The Green Anja Pill Group Chairman said: “We regret the decision of every doubt.
You have deliberately decided not to make any debate in the group.
“Even in the background that there were no content differences, we cannot understand this step,” he said.
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the violation of the low-Saxon Greens deputies of Every Twest to the CDU as a betrayal.
“The conduct of former Greens deputies in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal to voters, but also betrayal to Red Green,” the Federal Chief of Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to allow the country's day to be re-elected quickly.
The exit of Twestens costs Red Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician, in her hurt vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country, criticized SPD General Secretary Hubertus Heil.
“It’s a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty entry game and is trying to beat political capital from it.”
Niedersachsen's CDU Group Chief Björn Tümler wants to recommend to its MPs to include every doubt in the CDU.
The head of the SPD in Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the outcome of the 2013 national election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest force, SPD and Greene in the country, but had a thin majority of a vote in the country.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is talking about contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the Editorial Network of Germany (RND) speech and response.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp.
On the Consumer Protection Portal www.Lebensmedierwarung.de, the Federal States shall use the latest information on the affected egg species.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if after all we know at present, a health risk is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the researcher is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately turned on and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since becoming acquainted with Germany’s involvement.
All information and risk assessment can be retrieved for consumers.
Trade, as well as the manufacturers, has to ensure that the products sold are transportable and healthy.
If the residue height content of 0.005mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, these are not able to travel.
Unlaid eggs, however, can be sold and consumed.
This time, companies are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, production companies are not directly responsible.
Rather, they must expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there is too little control in serious cases.
Is it just the staff or the key competence?
It was just the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded by 100 percent.
As a result, consistent clarification of such events and the transfer of them to the prosecutors in the cases in which criminal offences may arise are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect the responsible authorities to have a complete enlightenment.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
If an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly offended.
By means of the armoured means, manufacturers, traders and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
Basically, it must be clear that the unlawful use of the insecticide fipronil in the attitude of life-sustaining animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This requires consistent and high-pressure work on all levels.
I expect all competent authorities to clarify the matter immediately and inextricably.
How football’s financial rules affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some of the consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, because the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must prove at some point that Neymar's transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid $222 million ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary worth several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly lock the money to make Neymar sign up and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding by Qatar's energy-rich ruler family.
Associations are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must resist with legitimate sources of revenue that enable them to break-even point in their business related to football.
FFP was created by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP focused on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.
The change meant that the business model used by the novel Abramovich originally in Chelsea in 2003 - a club with potential bought and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue.
During the current three-year FFP billing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can reduce losses of €30 million.
And although Platini fell from the presidency in Ungnade in 2015, his UEFA successor Alexander Ceferin continued to work to deter excessive spending.
“However, FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future,” Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a package, it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the withdrawal amount can be shown for the next five years in the amount of EUR 44.4 million in the year's finale.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, has met the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of €60 million (at least $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League season remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to list their financial supervision by blowing their revenue through companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company might sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar via payments from the WM 2022 organizational committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will become WM ambassador and such a maneuver could easily be invented for UEFA regulatory authorities.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to implement the rules.
UEFA had no preliminary conversations with PSG about Neymar’s transfer, said Thursday the people familiar with the situation.
They spoke to The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published reports show that PSG 2015/16, with a turnover of 542.4 million euros, has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
\"It's a clear case of - financial doping - with the club and the state - the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga’s reservations against a state that finance an association.
“It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country.
Swiss is looking for a new schoggileverant
In recent years, Chocolate Frey has produced board chocolates for Swiss.
Now, the southern cooperation is facing a possible end: the airline re-writes the contract.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report by the newspaper North-West Switzerland on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control.
“With the current supplier Chocolate Frey, we are very satisfied,” said the spokeswoman.
Around 17 million small red-winged shoggi tables distribute 14 grams a year to the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to make any information about the costs.
Branchinsiders estimate the volume of orders according to northwest Switzerland to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more importantly, the advertising effect is: for a schoggi manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
How many applicants there are in the new application, Swiss does not want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolate Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Chocolate tables have been distributing Swiss on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with Migro’s daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The ability to place the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago to start working with Chocolate Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-range flights, the customers of the First Class are spoiled with treats by the Confiserie Sprungli, in the Business Class wet passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolate Frey.
Also on the short line Swiss Schoggi distributed by Chocolate Frey, both in business and economics class.
Athletics - Discussion Olympicser Robert Harting reaches WM final
The three-time world champion competes for a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother Christoph, Olympicser of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup separation and was only able to watch the debate competition from the tribune.
Also, with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters wide, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into “Wet Hot American Summer” and “Comrade Detective” into the niche
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic due to the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (as the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy \"The State\" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things.
As a cultural architecture, it is equally a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as franchise, it feels like time is running short.
“First Day of Camp” worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking box of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By solidifying themselves at the core of the gag - actors of middle age play horny children who grow up - they still create the inability to win back the last part of the joke.
\"Ten Years Later - with its adults now playing adults is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more according to the casting cane principle, including a reef on the 90s stalker films such as \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\" - The hand that shakes the eye -
At one point, a character stumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates, and “a series of other things from 1991”.
Many of the central stories are the same.
The loving Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is joined, now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon’s bottom lipbar of Singles, whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It’s the moments of random madness that could warm up this franchise like a kind of recurring “Seven Up” series until he reaches what I think he’s going to take as his logical conclusion: “Wit Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later — his last scene will show the band how she’s going to visit the film premiere of “Wet Hot American Summer.”
\"Comrade Detective - on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of 'The Americans' - of the film 'Atomic Blonde' and even of 'GLOW' with its east-west ring-fighting iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism, and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles — a hard-hitting Gregor and an idealist Iosef — are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on television, how Americans might do it with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find the Voice Out'.
But Comrade Detective is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one.
In six long episodes, it draws to it, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.
\"Comrade Detective - which was edited at a lower length, could better deliver its agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who slam a bunch of Hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a feed for a situation.
The fictional Romanian creators did not lie wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and with the honours.
Battle of drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in fighting the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the prosecutor told Konstanz on Friday.
In this case, 15 accused persons aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and already arrested.
In addition, officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in Italy at the same time.
Against the two suspected Italians, there were German arrest warrants.
The two are likely to be delivered to Germany.
The action involved Italian and Bavarian investigators.
A total of over 300 police officers were in use.
Members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, and robbery and extortion.
As of summer 2016, the prosecutorate of Konstanz has determined against organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a government exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the large effort was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo.
In this case, Italian nationals in particular had a reference to the Italian Mafia.
An incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired in a guesthouse early in the morning, is likely to go to the band's account.
How to complain big gaps in foreign register
\"Data of citizens who should not appear there\": According to a report, the Foreign Registrar in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This led to partly gravitating misdemeanors in asylum procedures.
The Federal Government’s refugee management officer, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has made a media report on major gaps in the foreign central register.
Deficiency in the data recorded there could result in asylum procedures and expulsions, in part, in grave misdemeanors, warning of an analysis that is available to the South German newspaper.
According to the Register, 10 million people with foreign nationality have been recorded, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is thus managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts has not so far been good.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, “of people who have long since been alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register.”
“Faulty data input can slow down back processes significantly, according to the report.
Moreover, statistics on foreign people have included EU citizens who would not have to travel.
However, such wrong assignments led to a distorted debate on dealing with departures, it is therefore in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun sending refugees families of under 16-year-olds back to Italy when they arrived from there.
This comes from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the “New Osnabrücker Zeitung”
The paper therefore states that the BAMF has carried out such procedures - related to families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 -
Since the end of 2014 it has been virtually impossible, according to the newspaper referring to the difficult situation on site.
After the Dublin Agreement, it is responsible for refugees of the EU state who first reach them.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, this state can send him back to the country of entry.
For reasons, the office now writes: “In the meantime, the capacity of admission for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly.
Italy has issued guarantees for the collection and accommodation of family.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECMR) considers these promises sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement.
The domestic political spokesman of the Left Group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: \"Family with children threatens to be in danger of human rights abuse in the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare.\"
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood of people living in Oberreichbach already provided the blood donation service for other people.
At least the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
All in all, Jürgen Greule, who has now shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community in the meeting of the municipal council honors the multiple willingness to donate blood.
“It’s amazing how our bodies are designed for this, and we’re still taking advantage of the respect that our blood provides for strangers, and we’re still showing them unselfishly,” says Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
“A single blood donation helps several people,” explained the circuit overseer of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the preserves are broken down into their components.
Once again, three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions being carried out in Oberrijkbach in the spring.
“This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors,” said the DRK circuit overseer.
Apparently, the change in the theatre house led to higher attendance numbers a few years ago.
Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 donations of blood each.
Half that many booked Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pchromer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave ten milliliters of their life.
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have damped speculations about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will “bear” when it keeps interest rates on family income in the midst of a growing pressure.
The political decision-makers of the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members reaching an increase this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in autumn.
But they signaled that in the next few years interest rates would be needed to draw up Brexit-heated inflation and said that the credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also agreed to withdraw a portion of the Mammut Economic Package, which was released a year after Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial funds for banks as of February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: “In the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on the real income of the households continues to burden consumption.
On interest rates, she repeated that “a certain punishing of monetary policy, for cooling inflation and a bit bigger, would be necessary than the expected markets.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
The bank, however, emphasized that increases would take place “in a step-by-step and “limited” manner.
The bank’s downwardly corrected growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell according to this news to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have slowed the rising expectations of an increase in interest rates and GDP has increased from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover easily after the bank by the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by an increase in inflation and low levels of salary, as the deterioration first got even worse before it improved.
She added that in the next few years, monetary policy cannot prevent income collapse, but she added that the wages will recover at the end of their three-year prognosis.
The economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate part of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes a year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote which caused the fall of the pound.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years to complete the price and economy.
Prior to the Bank's final judgment on interest rates, the reputation for an increase in interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a 0.5% increase in July.
Inflation has fallen from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in the last month, although the bank said it was expected and will attract it again in the coming months.
The bank said that the surplus in relation to its target of 2% is to be attributed to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “In view of the recent decline in the Swap rates, the mortgage market is expected to become more competitive again, as the lenders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals are running out and the new mortgages are closed, and many with charge-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular.
NHS (The National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to a “transformative” HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against funding the drug in NHS.
NHS England announced that a preexposition prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sex can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, now delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, after which the NHS had the authority to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it.
The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as “an important new intervention, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a “determining moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Preexposition prophylaxis (PrEP) is a sequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious people.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medications are present in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those who are in charge of treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and individuals with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a doctor may also sign up for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting and implementing clinical evidence as used to a large extent.
Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in dealing with one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.
Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted towards needy and endangered people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onward, people with high HIV levels will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to negotiations with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority must now be that the study is being carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people.
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: “The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and delayed implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society.
The Great Life: Between shot and clever designer-tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced himself from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is evidence of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
“I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room,” Joanne says.
“I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earl's Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day.
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet of large apartment has been completely overcrowded.
Originally a one-room property with a shackled layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage room and an intermediate shot to optimally use the generous ceiling height.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my request, she said.
To this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate shot in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively in order to solve the standard.
“The steel plant is quite complicated,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were piled over each other without having to bend.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but also installing the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below.
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with a lot of extra drama.
For the intermediate shot, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all the cutleries and glasses of Joanne.
By the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
There is nothing new about collapsing kitchens.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
“A bit of engineering art went in there,” explains Erfan of the steel-enhancing, furnished MDF tour.
“It’s counterweighty, so when you put the door up, it slips very easily.”
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“At the end of the day, you will sell the base area — or how your property is estimated —” says Erfan.
“In a rudimentary form, a real estate broker will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size.
Here they have managed to increase the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help you create an emotional bond in a home,” Erfan says.
“You don’t fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart.
It shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square meter number from slightly standard to something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave it.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has brought him to the Supreme Court to explain how their property and business assets should be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, gathered since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburb.
After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin, described by Paul as a “main operator and the dominant personality” in the De Lutis family, owns about two-thirds of the corporate assets and Paul about one-third.
A court case states that this means Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
“The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best object,” he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed talks.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but he refuses to manage some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
“My Italian heritage says that the family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firm held by both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies shops from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first Jeans store of the family.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was \"in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child\" (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.
“Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis company group, while Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
As both Luke and Mark are, Paul says, \"about the conditions of their financial separation has been bitterd.\"
Colin was very reluctant, although he was a former AFL member and, after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say, “I can’t say much, because the case is in court.
“It’s very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts,” he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet the demands of his brother.
“Our father wouldn’t have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute,” he said, adding, “always hoping for a solution.”
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
“Our case will be resolved by the courts in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the news media reports, in hopes of keeping the chief on a more uniform course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House, which he wants to repair: bad information that has come into the President’s hands.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow — whether on paper or in briefings — because the president would make better decisions if he received good information.
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television lasts for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.
“If candidate Trump was angry because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of positions to be convinced,” former election campaign advisor Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise price.”
Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit was ever “controllable” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don’t know about others — that Trump’s tweets would have included even more vaccines without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his employees have been able to keep him away from trouble several times, their efforts have been rewarded.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that might promote their views from the world.
Politico, entirely concerned with this story, reported in May on the preference of the advisor to provide the president with questionable information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he finds out where they come from.
That was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the Internet-provocator's website Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Staffwoman Katie Walsh of being \"the source behind a pile of leaks\" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter because of Shikans, or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and has withdrew them.
Trump read the article and started questioning staff about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, “have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper tram that Trump receives.”
How did that work?
Kelly tried to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisor still strives for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most Seeking Criminals Get Post by Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is asked and hoped for.
Police all over Europe are sending mail cards to dangerous criminals this summer on the run.
Since the addresses of the sought-for serious criminals are naturally unknown, indications from the population are hoped and asked.
On Friday, Europol reported on the action following the \"EU Most Wanted\" Advent calendar from winter.
Experiences have shown that many refugees are hiding from holiday destinations, it said on the part of the European Union.
21 postcards have been compiled for seeking criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, there has been the website www.eumostwanted, which has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online searches could be arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to references to the publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate over a grave and return to the 'Millionaires Series'
Some of the most prosperous homeowners in the West Midlands are back with some determined travelers on foot who have negotiated a cemetery drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers parked their 20 trailers on a field outside a prosperous Solihull street called the “Millionaires Series.”
They brought horses, babies, and an army of transporters, only to be thrown out in May, without being intimidated by a grave excavated by the Council in order to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have oppressed the Solihull Council, who said that it is useless to deal with the problem.
An anonymous resident said, “They moved there on Monday evening after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passersby.
The Council must be forced by shame to implement in fact because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably even more today.
She added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by keeping long lessons to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the council can't even stop that.
A resident who didn’t want to be mentioned said, “It’s funny, we’ve just seen the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area.
A spokesperson for the Solihull Council said: “We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with Solihull’s police, taking the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we present our case.
Waldhotel Luise is from Birkenhof
From the former Hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise will be available.
The house in front of the gates of Joy City is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
These are good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Birkenhof hotel by the then-authentic operating company mbH on April 13, 2014, at the time, around 30,000 nights were lost per year and revenue was also generated by the Kurtaxe.
In the autumn of 2014, with dramatic increases in the number of refugees coming into the county, the hotel building was offered as a collection accommodation to the Landratamt, providing controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
At that time, the decision was not controversial in the council.
But above all, the mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interest in the house.
He should keep right.
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Birkenhof hotel at a voluntary extension in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star PLUS category under the name of Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the pleasure-city property.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
It's called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Birkenhof Hotel has been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, what extensive renovation work will be done.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially demolished, old baths removed from the rooms.
The whole hotel building is a single building.
There is much to do until March.
“It’s actually a nice hotel,” says Thomas Scherer in a conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walkable showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything will be \"beautiful citizens\" later, as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
“We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it.”
swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are included in the facilities.
One does not want to position at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at a high downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to stand wide, explains Scherer.
Both individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable at the hotel.
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause have already led him, says Scherer.
The ideas of the city are similar to those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.
When asked about the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to set himself exactly.
Nearly under one million euros, he expects.
The external systems are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
In an indoor courtyard a large terrace will be available from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: \"Freudenstadt is a good market -
Russia Affairs: U.S. Special Mediator Sets Grand Jury
In Russia’s affair with U.S. President Donald Trump, Special investigator Robert Mueller, according to a report, is to have used a so-called Grand Jury.
Over the past few weeks, the body has taken up work, writing the “Wall Street Journal” calling on familiar people in the matter.
The newspaper appreciated the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
The channel CNN reported that the body’s first charges were already made in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. secret services have long been accusing Kremlin of deliberately joining the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were any agreements between Trump's election campaign team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigation should be on several men who acted as Republican advisors in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trump's private and business environment under the lupe.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator Trump personally pushed into the center and questioned whether the president might have interfered with the justice in the wake of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to review the evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to raise charges.
Grand juries are therefore also called indictments.
They are usually turned on when it comes to bigger and more controversial cases.
The process always takes place behind closed doors.
The body may also be turned on by the prosecutors in order to invite persons to take an oath under oath.
According to the channel CNN, pre-charges have already been issued, which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, the report said.
In addition, they should provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and brother-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his then election campaign chief Paul Manafort were involved in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the U.S. television that the deployment showed that Mueller did not let himself be intimidated by his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it should not necessarily be called that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the investigation of a charge.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the body of the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“Russia’s history is a total invention,” Trump said.
The topic gives Democrats an opportunity to “feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about.”
His special advisor Ty Cobb said in a statement that he knew nothing about the deployment of a Grand Jury.
But they also usually worked in secret, he emphasized.
The White House advocated any measures that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a fair way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that it will not be determined against the president.
There is no reason to believe that something has changed about this, the statement continued.
But Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this ruse, accusations against Trump have become loud, and he wants to hinder the justice.
Comey said in June before a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After presenting US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his staff.
This caused speculation as to whether Trump wants to get rid of Mueller.
Unlike an independent special representative of Congress, such as in the Watergate affair about the later resignation of President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could be theoretically fired at the President's forces by the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators of both parties want to avoid such a step.
On Thursday, two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented drafts of law, after which the special investigator could no longer be released as easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drives in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has been dissolved from the almost seven times the size of Berlin from the shelf.
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The more than one billion tons of heavy and 5,800-mile-long [5800 km] colossus is now driving north and will probably take two, three years to melt.
It is at 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometers in one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
There is no danger for people to get out of it.
To the extent that climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg, research data is unclear.
In total, however, for about 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shells in the region, the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a fact background.
Many researchers believe that this could be related to global warming.
The colossus that has now been broken down has been part of the Larsen-C shell.
Schelzeis swims on the sea and is eaten by large glaciers.
As a result, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C shell is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.
North of this shelfeise was disrupted by the balance of growth and cancellation a few years ago.
A complete shell has fallen there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
The Larsen-C shell is also at risk, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece is broken off at a key point.
The melting of Scarheleis and Eisberg does not raise sea level as they swim on the water and push ice as much water as it results after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shell ice leads to the glacier moving directly into the sea and being able to flow off much faster than before.
This could perhaps increase sea level, but only to a limited extent, the British research project writes to observe Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen-C shell is the fourth largest shell of Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
“Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position,” said Martin O’Leary from the British Swansea University.
“This is the widest withdrawal since the beginning of the records,” he also confirmed.
Among scientists it is controversial whether the Larsen-C shell will grow again or return long-term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: “Our models say it will be less stable.”
But this development will take decades.
Even though these researchers do not return to climate change, in recent decades a lot of ice shells of the Antarctic peninsula have collapsed.
This long summit of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic peninsula has been warming around three degrees over the past 50 years, counting among the areas where the temperature is fastest.
CDU wants home fare for staff
Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free-standing positions, the CDU calls for the employer association to leave to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the county day 41 has passed through new offices in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now, another 17 instructors have their first day of work behind them.
The teachers at the circuit are apparently very desirable.
Around 620 applications were to be recorded for the places to be awarded this year.
However, the circuit lacks staff to manage the increased requirements and tasks.
Currently there are still 50 unoccupied places in the district of Mettmann.
They seek, among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative with the FDP and the UWG in the circuit day and face the lack of expertise in the administration.
The administration is intended to develop a concept of personnel and staff development according to the parties’ wishes -
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of professionals but also to counter future-oriented the applicant button.
The overall concept should focus on the inside and outside, show concrete measures for cross-expositors and include a training offensive, require CDU, FDP and UWG.
That's what I've heard after a good approach.
Because the circle has to deal with personal problems that you didn’t know before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive products.
The speech is of a right-wing competition by public employers.
To this end, a high number of employees who get sick or age-related leave the service.
The highest time to act, so that no more places remain unoccupied.
However, Klaus-Dieter Volks, Group Chief of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.
He had recently caused a Faust Thick surprise in the circuit day when he publicly questioned the staff cost cover and the other parties were surprised.
Peoples want to check all the possibilities that allow an exit from the municipal Employer Association.
“If we don’t come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the county administration with the trade unions — perhaps even in cooperation with the county cities — should seek a home tariff — so peoples.
In this way, the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than it actually provides the tariff order for the public service.
The salaries are currently exact requirements, increases or more money only if you change to a higher level that is oriented to professional years.
But the work of the county has grown ever more and more in recent years.
Just a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be set up, where employees are concerned about the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy sharpens the sound to NGO migrants rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue to do so if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
“If NGOs don’t sign a new code of conduct, it’s hard to see how they can continue to work,” said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Rescuet' because their team had effectively collaborated with human trafficking dealers in a way that made illegal immigration easier.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself to the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, the salvation of human life remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we can’t operate in the search and rescue zone right now,” the organization said in a statement to the social media.
“We can judge all the charges currently collected only after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation.”
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew takes submarine migrants on board who are delivered directly by human dealers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting was allegedly held just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor’s act, whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motive.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have, in particular, an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been willing to comply with the code: Save the Children, MAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring “essential changes or disabilities” to their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize-winning organization is doctors without limits (MSF).
Minniti now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy has declined greatly in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan Coast Guards and co-operation with local mayors have produced fruit.
“In the last days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the Berlin Outposts, and two guests met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy quadruples and sights for four days.
There were three guided guides available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
Wachenheim Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It was followed by points of view, in part on towers, from which one could look far above the palace forest and the pre-positioned plains.
In between, there has always been longer increases, for the long trials rewarded.
On the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the point of view was driven by “flowing” trials and moderate increases.
Over the last two days, a lot of heights have been said.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and return huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers at the outdoor inhalatorium breathe healing Sole.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4,500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporting and cultural -.
Console instead of lawns - Bundesliga equips for e-sports
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of fighting in wind and weather over the stadium terraces?
In fact, e-sports has long become a serious industry, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gags including.
This has also been recognized by the first federal leagues, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
In 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg started, followed by FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
“We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB,” says Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that \"there are still several associations on this train.\"
On the next weekend, the FIFA Football World Cup will host the first “Interactive Club World Cup” in London, where players from different clubs will compete.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now consulting an agency for virtual football players.
“The real football has to deal with, in particular, the 14-30-year-olds that young people are going to go to the stadium in the future,” says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asians.
With prominent e-sports under contract, one could be more frequently present in these markets online than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it?
In e-sports, computer games such as “League of Legends” — Dota 2 — ‘Counter Strike’ — or the football simulation FIFA are run at a competitive level.
In the long run, as in normal sports, leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
In the 2022 Asian Games, E-Sport is already part of the official programme.
But is this really a good sport?
For many, the idea is certainly necessary.
Ingo Froböse has also long struggled with the question.
For the professor at the German University of Sports in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - e.g. increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, it requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and a fast response ability.
Professional gamers should train not only at the console but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet.
“The fit player is a good player.
Frobose also sees problems: “Doping is becoming more and more a topic.”
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
In a positive way, the scientist has the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are on the go internationally, which is like a large global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in the e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales will be 130 million.
Against the almost 2.4 billion Euros of the football national league, that is little.
However, the e-sports — no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey — are writing the Deloitte consultants.
Many countries are still international.
Large markets include Asia and the United States, where ex-basket ball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the esports betting provider Unikrn.
There is also some work in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports were introduced as a teaching course, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, the football-first league unions are now obliged to set up an e-sport department, according to Dutt.
“In the European comparison, Germany is continuing to decline,” explains Röttgermann, CEO of VfB.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to destroy the old days, is not enough today.
It is about maintaining the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
“We live in a digitized world,” Dutt said.
“It is not possible to hold that only in football everything remains the way it has always been.”
Gift egg ade - The egg-alternatives for cooking and baking
Since then, almost all federal states have been affected by the scandal around poisoned eggs.
Aldi South and Aldi Nord responded and took all the eggs from the sale in Germany.
Only eggs are to be taken into the shelf, which do not prove to contain a fipronile.
Michelle Carter convicted of the texts that Conrad Roy of suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texting and calling for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to cash.
Carter was sentenced in June for the fatal killing of Conrad Roy, who took his life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said on Thursday at the hearing: “My family is insolent.
My son was my best friend.
Carter was allowed to stay free until he was called.
She had been faced with a 20-year maximum penalty, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in his eyes, with folded hands and eyes directed down when she was condemned.
“Your actions have killed Conrad Roy,” the state attorney told the court.
“She ended her life to make her own better.
She has not taken on any responsibility, she said.
“She didn’t show any repentance.”
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “fearful circumstance that she completely regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that her “old age or maturity or even her mental illness has a significant impact on her actions.”
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said there's no day I'm not grieving the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and as I deal with everything, I try to be there for his sisters, in spite of all the pain we will endure for eternity.
Roy’s sister, Camdyn Roy, said she’ll be “sharpened” by knowing that she’ll never participate in her brother’s wedding or be a aunt for his children.
“No more to have this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with myself for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to be setting a legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
“Hand you up, jump from a building, first yourself, I don’t know, there are many ways,” she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: “You have to do it, Conrad, and “Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Roy's death and ordered that she benefit from the case by any press.
The case has shared legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British co-habitant in Italy in 2007 before being released two years ago.
Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison.”
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini-lam
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
The FC Bayern does not trust the Confed Cup winner to have a big season to extra motivation there.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the extra piece of clothing was very, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer were to be seen, he made himself the bond assigned to him to the arm.
“The coach didn’t announce it,” the Confed Cup winner told the story, after his first deployment as Bayern captain.
Well, the performance could have been better than at 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the character of the coach could also mean Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been selected as a game leader by the youth players, debuters and just out of vacation professionals.
Sugar is best distributed to those to whom you trust a lot that you want to keep with Laune.
So anyone who has been chosen to join Lahm’s legacy can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: \"This is what you want as a player: take responsibility -
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini-lame.
To the right, this is his position, the white tie on the arm did her other.
And at all, Kimmich acted like the one who can best take the rudder into his hands in this start-up formation.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the uninhibited troops.
He had the view for the whole, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal thus overplaying his lack of fitness (laughs); Renato Sanches, with the purpose of joining the performances of the Asia trip (laughs only on condition); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle, not to show negative in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
That's fine anyway.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defence, both of whom acted sovereignly.
The famously occupied Napoli storm often proved to be difficult, and süle also tried to succeed a few times in the game-building process.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was “not the way we had hoped for it.”
But he also showed a good performance in the debut.
Game displacement, pace change: “For this style, I was also picked up.
How unusual this Bayern world is for the new accesses is seen after the party.
Rudy, for example, did not give in the catacombs one or two, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich agreed after a few clever statements in the back of his new co-players.
There he heard an interesting phrase from Süle: “What’s going on here, I’ve already noticed.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game.
At the same time, he no longer needs to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB women
David Alaba believes in the success of our OFB women
Austria's most famous footballer has just reported on Twitter shortly before the game and the ÖFB women wish everything well.
The Bayern-Legionaire is, yes, almost a clubmate of ÖFB-Capitänin Schnaderbeck and fiebert with our Ladys.
The second of the Austrian footballers of the year and Champions League winners should be a special motivational injection.
The famous Bayern dusel might also need our ladies well.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It often seemed incompatible, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still the Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This appears after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wise (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request about a change in economic policy - and at the same time call the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: “Wissing is responding to the wishes of the economy that Lemke has blocked all of us.
The biggest turning point is seen by Natus in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s priority list.
This year, the Ministry is still hoping for a plan-setting procedure, until 2021 the construction law will be established.
A role in the country’s plans is also played by the West Umgehung Trier, which is at the forefront of the Federal Road Plan.
The goal is to operate the route in December 2020, said Ministry spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees a way to support regional, but internationally competitive companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Trade (IHK) Trier, as encouraged by Wissing, aims at a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been declining for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company, praises the IHK.
In the new Master Bonus, the Chamber of Crafts Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
Provided is a prize of 1000 Euros for the current master’s exam and 2500 Euros if graduates make themselves independent within ten years of master’s training.
However, the housework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, it is quick to create facts, at the same time the country failed to meet the needs of the personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive officer of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want Wissing to set up mobility during the country’s operations, 29 jobs have been occupied so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to be given to external offices.
CDU Group Vice Christian Baldauf refers to calculations of the Court of Accounts, the country investing in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in receiving national roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to solve the lack of skilled workers in the region.
In addition, it is important to note that the overall development of the broadband in the country has been in evidence.
In 2016, regional companies rated the network supply in an IHK survey only with the note 3.4.
They complained about stocking internet connections and breaks.
On the other hand, former Secretary of State Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in charge of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe, where after four months of disagreements, she had already been back in the field.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software into more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said that the company believes that “there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions, referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is located, to prohibit or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a recall.
European automotive manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered to be carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The costs for automotive manufacturers to install systems to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of hating the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the failures of Volkswagen, which are the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but returned in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were charged with Volkswagen, others being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's engine development in Germany.
Former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to deal with emissions regulations in Europe, and a demand focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be difficult: the luxury automobile manufacturer contributes to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the fleet on Saturday at the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to join, on the morning of Saturday, a fleet passes through Munich, which has a special message.
When it comes to the Isar on Saturday, it will see a large river between Floucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a common fleet, with Isar tourists.
In addition, the construction will be carried out.
On the floor you can see a large info-transparent.
It shows a garbageberg.
The pick-up to a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto “Wahre Love is ...” the concept for the Isar is to sharpen as a protective wild river.
Last summer, the fleet passed through the Isar and also this year, there were other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillos Knollennassen and Laughing Against Suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most widely published cartoon characters, the knots of his characters are his trademarks.
Even with 85, the Argentine still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laugh, because there is too much suffering in the world.
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he, among other things, passed through himself as a character of greeting cards - which frustrated him.
“The happiest day in my career was the day when I lost my job,” he said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he succeeded in breaking through at the end of the 60s: with the publication of his cartoons in \"Paris Match\" and then in the \"Star\" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist of cities was inspired.
Large round Mordillo figures immerse themselves in drawings with the step tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits at the sign table today, working for almost ten hours every day.
Over calendars, puzzles, books for large and small, t-shirts, pluspushes and watches, its drolly characters continue to spread throughout the world.
For six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the film \"Crazy Island\" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-fusser as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which will come to the cinema screen in 2019.
“I don’t know exactly what they’re going to say, it’s strange to me,” says Mordillo.
The screen is not written by him.
That’s why he’s more focused on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
lavender from the Provence of Climate Change Threatened
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is in decline due to the conditions of drought and because of the disease-transfering insects, which scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions are preparing major headaches.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought a lot less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender.
There is also a small zicade, a microbacterium that transmits glucose cicades, and in very dry weather there are a lot of them.
And there's a lot on the game.
lavender oil not only attracts holidayers, it is also very requested for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil.
The solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slowing down of the thinning from the ground, but also the spraying of the plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön now celebrates its 1200-year-old existence.
This Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival is a high point.
Crams, fences, dealers, vaginants or a land servant camp are to be experienced in downtown these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the weekly Riodoce newspaper usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in Sinaloa state through organized crime, corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
It was told them that it is important to change your routines.
Two high-ranking journalists are discussing what feels more secure: they are supposed to take their children to the office, which was the target of an attack with grenade in 2009 or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and feelings are sufficient.
There are drug smuggling, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the government’s salary list or cardelles, a catalogue of criminals who threaten Mexico’s chaos.
There is no break of rest from violence, and while bodies are growing throughout the country, there are more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto arrived in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter are its publisher and its inspiration of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word \"Justice\" - depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although a special national attorney was established in 2010 to process the cases of journalists, it has introduced only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the murders of journalists are rarely brought before trial.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating Sinaloa's violence, even though they are insecure and although the terrain is still more treacherous now.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
“It’s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop,” he says.
“As long as we don’t know why, we’re distrusting everyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and was shot at him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with \"Twelfth River\".
The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two grown children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiac.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn’t matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoles for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of ‘rest’ when only one cardel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes to the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is guilty of not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February there was the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival artillery factions in the war with Guzman’s sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, alleged gang members bought up every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper skioske.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold $50 in shares.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to operate journalism without pushing on the noise poison problem,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hit investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious \"Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize\" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the Committee's International Press Freedom Award to protect journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever they led.
He willingly admitted that he was afraid.
“I want to continue living,” he said at the time of the CPJ award.
He said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in Sinaloa, a way of life.
“You have to take on the task that happens to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid one.
I don't want to be asked, \"What have you done in the face of so many dead people ... why didn't you say what happened?\"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird that could rush like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for the routine of his destruction?
His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive.
“They don’t like it when you’re busy with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret start-up and landing paths — to move drugs.
“These things were not allowed,” Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-responsibility.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The anger is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that “Grey is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing happened to Javier.”
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the area where Riodoce’s employees met for safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. Days before it was announced that psyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40°C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class quarter of Culiacan.
Half in the bar, some of the reporters wondered if these officers belong to the 50 percent of police officers who the governor himself described as not trustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week’s edition, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé to the state expenditure that focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that, in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, removed a block from the prosecutor's office, carried out a kidnapping.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was offered when it became time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite location of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling institutional revolution party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of corruption because of high-carrying cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this location, including one in which a son of El Chapo-Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, the readers had considered Valdez’s column as the best informed source of kidnapping.
“In the past, we had known what happened,” said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname “El Flaco” because of its slim body structure.
“Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources.
Valdez’s office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists because the employees became something they had never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A large body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is itss.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing down on the streets and buildings in organized protests, SOS Press.
On that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for the justice in Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez’ murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out journalists and killing them because they told the truth.
She has since requested that she be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are of organized crimes, government officials involved and an equal society — surrounded.
In his last book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were under cover with organized crime.
The media guard group Articulo 19 has allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year.
“In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth open,” Ramirez said.
Clearly, the murders have a frightening effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by Zetas-Cartell: “Here I am because of my reports.”
A computer keyboard and headphone were next to their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Czechoslovakia after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cardelle with a guide article on the title page with the heading “What Do You Want From Us”
Some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and are looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are chased, as it seems, by the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who, along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, was murdered three months after fleeing Veracruz in 2015.
For those who stay back and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, Riodoce’s editors sat on the front of the office and drank beer when at one time all of their phones began to sum up.
A number of shootings with band rivals and security forces near the Mazatlan bath site had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war further escalated as promised by a number of Kartell embassies in the region.
From the Bordstein edge they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens hounded up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were ready.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, Riodoce’s employees followed his tracks.
“How can you just think about it,” Bojorquez said, “if on the same day that Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street for reporting?”
Dinosaur used tarning to wipe out his enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian miners have been so well received that experts have described it as “Mona Lisa the dinosaur.”
It was so well received that they could even find out that his skin was of redish brown — and they said they had something of a “unsatisfied past.”
The report in the journal “Current Biology” referred to him as “the best-punctuated dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur copies in the world.”
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurier that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the mid-Creid period.
His incredibly well-preserved state has caught researchers who described it as \"really remarkable\"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant fresser is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock at the square, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy ground.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you’re just blinding a little with your eyes, you might almost believe it’s been sleeping,” said Caleb Brown, chief author at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
\"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs\"
Researchers have found that this plant freser, though covered with a armor and similar to a walking tank, was probably threatened by meat freezing dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white tarning to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter coating, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to mix better in its surroundings and alienate its enemies, experts say, indicating that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurs family has made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli according to museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of sheds and armors across his body.
They discovered the counter-estimation, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although counter-estimation is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased from sufficient pressure by meat-free dinosaurs that evolution favored the wear of confrontation as means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter-estimation - think of Rehe, Zebras, or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaurs were exposed to a real struggle for survival.
“Strong predators’ behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the creed era must have been,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about his life, including his preserved gut content, to find out what he ate as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was driven into a river and driven out to the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea ground.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far further inland than they are today.
“This nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved skin, but it remains preserved in three dimensions and retains the animal’s original form,” Brown said.
“The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early creative period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to rebuild it. If you just squeez a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's asleep.
The Creed period was a time when huge theropods, meat-fearing dinosaurs, standing on two legs, passed through the earth.
Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived for millions of years after Boraleopelta, the armored dinosaur was chased by some of his terrible ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk in the sea after death and mumbled in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world’s best preserved armored dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is completely from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long peaks, which ran from its shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant fresser was fluctuated by western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur’s underwater equipment kept its armor in exquisite detail.
The stoned remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover hollow tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in Lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Stoned remains of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that bear the animal's skull.
His right forward foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upward.
I can count the sheds at his sole'.
In the Weather: Mass carambo layer on A8: Many injured
Huge accident on Thursday night on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are engaged in a mass carambo layer.
There are numerous injured, km-long stalls - and Gaffer.
On the Stuttgart-München (A8) highway, about 20 people were injured at a mass carbomb on late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police first, at 5:00 p.m. between the terminals of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg County), almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were interned during a thunderstorm.
At first, there was no information about the exact number of the injured.
It was about mild to medium injuries, a police spokesperson said.
A large bid of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely shut down towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich there was a ten-mile-long backstory.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive obstacles on the opposite track - by numerous gatekeepers.
The firefighter noted the characteristics of the vehicle deflectors, which are now expected to face sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests “Comfort Check-in”
It’s a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: nothing unbeknownst to you is sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or you're deep into your work and you've just got a brilliant thought.
And then: Pufff.
Come the sheep and wake up an insanity or tear the passenger out of the workflow in the middle.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The German Railway is currently testing the creation-less ticket control.
It is simply confirmed by mobile that you take your place and thus depreciate the ticket.
At present, a test operation runs on two routes.
“Come on the offer, we’ll extend it.
It will then be expected to be available on many other long-distance long-distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year, said a railway spokesman.
“Comfort Check-in” calls the train the road’s travel card rendition without a driver.
In order to be able to use them, however, some conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which is what most passengers do anyway.
You also need to buy through the train app, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway.
Finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the “comfort check-in” works like this: you get on the train, call his ticket under “My Tickets”.
The test customers will then have a button for electronic development.
The train attendants receive a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the passenger arrives at the ticket check in place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already deprecated online ticket.
So you can go to sleep, continue to work, keep quiet.
The check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train, which is to be used by the passengers.
“If you want to travel without ticket control by our train crew, simply check out the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal on the train, says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr.
Second Plus: “And our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs.
Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the biggest troubles.
Because often you have, in any case, not all the documents you need to get online tickets.
Either the credit card or the staff card is missing or another document that needs to be displayed.
The result is endless discussion between train attendants and passengers, leading to poor mood in the department or large room and delays in the control of their own ticket, and the driver at the end takes time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that is also only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet available.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: “Whose Streets”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just one day after arriving in New York City, St. Louis was born on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which she rented and rolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stooped over a post from someone from high school.
“The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it’s still on the street,” he said.
Confused because no one else posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TeePharoah has been constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to live to be killed by Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted an image of Brown's lifeless body, which had been stretched out on the street and would remain there for four hours.
“That’s wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put off her cell phone to return to tweets later in the evening about people on the Canfield drive.
There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father who carried a sign with the inscription: \"Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son.\"
She observed a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a calling dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer reassured his gun and shouted, “I’m going to kill you animals all.”
“That’s not common,” Ferrell recalled.
“This is not the kind of murder that we have become accustomed to and that we can typically call.”
At this moment, I felt squeaky frost.
I was angry and weeping.
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the theme of a new documentary, “Whose Streets”, in cinemas from the age of 11.
It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, consisting of the view of people who lived in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a suitable crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation they had several times this morning \"about the black experience and the black state.\"
“You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe,” she reminded herself of what she said.
“We’re going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn’t right.
I couldn’t take them,” Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
You need to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I am lucky to give her an experience where she personally does not experience eclatant racism, she is no different from the next black female child.
I feel like I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it.
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
“My activism changed completely after August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequality in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come -
Weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to “document” what happened.
A question came to mind: “Will you document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of?”
This sceptic was fed by countless cases of human beings, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently said in an interview: “We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already collaborated with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death tract inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, followed the team of “Whose Streets” in the years following Brown’s shooting.
“This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We are talking,” Davis said.
“This was the main thing for me as these people are portrayed, because I will be shown that way.”
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that it was the movement - not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together - said Folayan - she proved to be the most open-minded participant in the film.
As a result, documents from Whose Streets show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell’s life as she loves herself and marries her wife.
“I felt like naked,” Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
“But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Life Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, following the killing of the black teen, Trayvon Martin, starred the film “BlacklivesMatter” in social media in 2012, identified themselves as gay.
“Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall,” Ferrell said, “and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything.
Folayan agreed, noting that “the movement is really held by black women and many black women.”
She insists, however, that “this is not an affirmative type of action,” when Ferrell was selected as the film’s heart because of her identity.
“She was the person who stirred up that energy,” she said.
“It’s not a coincidence, although she was at the front of the front because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman so much is at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen.
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on currency for 21⁄2 years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the social environment of the area she calls her home: “A chaos”
However, she emphasises on a singing and feels this memory has been committed since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.
From ' Dream' to 'Great Wahn': TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, even though it has not been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian zone has split the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Coldly, the subject is hardly one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page “People’s Friend Bitburg”.
While the one says to the bit gallery: “That would be a dream (Anja Becker) or “That would be really classed” (Nicole Schüsten), from the other side comes: “Brought no man” (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: “Greßtenwahn” (Lars Scholz).
While the advocates build on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, which also benefits the other businesses, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then blow out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farm market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
At the beginning of the construction work, this will be the end.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: “We have been buying in the farm market hall for almost a week for many years.
Especially our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women, are always very happy.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.
There are also in other cities.
The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting -
Gerd Densing: “Even if direct marketers live in a market hall in the gallery, they arrive at the height of the rent.
But it may not be very low in the new project.
Eva Kilic: “What are the shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drug or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There is enough of this in our city.
You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we keep the market hall at least.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the customer company and are also price-effective.
As you can see, shops in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Damage, special business, there is almost no more and what is left of it will probably disappear.
Wolf Fandel: “A shopping mall with a market hall doesn’t fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farm market hall go during construction time?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes.
Or the Spent Bit Gallery has already been able to distribute all of Bitburg’s stores before.
George Marquet: “It just won’t work.
And a shopping center that’s empty doesn’t need anyone either.
I think it would have been better to promote a right farm market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - there is no place for meaningful construction projects in Bitburg.
When the farm market hall is broken down, a piece of culture will disappear again.
A suitable similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York City, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost inconceivable - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wang-Tupfern and haircuts that she was sent by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the cutouts out of Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst rescinded a 35-year prison sentence after she made public as a secret classified diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Delaware-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and a dissident dissident whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone might look with these genomic data, has a sharp, though some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only a single photo - a grainy black-and-white selfie in which Manning apparently sits unwell on a driver's seat and wears a platinum wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette dust and rubber by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
“They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article,” Dewey-Hagborg said in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn’t visit at that time and she couldn’t be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letter friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic “Suppressed Images” illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which President Chelsea’s judgment would transform and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama was only a few days after the book was published that Mannings would demand release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, second-hand ways to further flame up the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.
When dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that “things happen for a certain reason.”
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature, called for an end to the “automatic division, whose foundation has been gender, race, sexuality and culture.”
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-folder of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or vocabulary according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in a biological way, we are all.
“What people will hopefully take with it is that our genome doesn’t care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are,” he said, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also shown.
DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these are 30 of these stories.
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novel.
She shows Manning how she appeared with a free speech phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong.
“If they’re colding your speech, they’ve won,” he said.
“So never stop the mouth.”
“It came directly from a letter she wrote to me,” said the artist who greeted me from Philadelphia.
“I still get glove when I talk about it.”
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition - as it was previously taken in the comic book in advance - but if she should do so, then she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacs that join like hordes of protesters.
This was also aimed at, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5-2 Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil.
“In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd of people,” he said.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her liberation,” he said.
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford seeking death
A nationwide human hunt is in progress for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who is sought as suspect after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago was charged with fatal injuries.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest orders were issued for murder because of her alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the Acts of Cook County Court.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stings.
A joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Authority states that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the site of the incident, and detectives investigating the sting as murder, while police actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an exceptional professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the Vice President for University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been on vacation and had been excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.
“This is now a criminal case studied by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation,” Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that “we are in touch with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. investigation authorities in any way imaginable.”
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand.
Chicago Police Officer Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said he was demanding the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
“The police have an idea of their location, and our efforts to locate them are strengthened,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Prada building, who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza’s management team released a statement to the residents: “The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
\"We will complete the WADA driver plan in the near future - the Russian Vice Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Vice Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the schedule, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA schedule has been updated in this regard - said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA’s schedule to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for resetting RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that might cause concern for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged state-funded dopings in Russian sports.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: “We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we won't give anything that doesn't exist.
Mutkos’ words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
Speaking to the Russian sales agency RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, adding: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one has proposed to accept this report unconditionally, Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After visiting the organization’s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is moving “in the right direction” to be re-used.
Aldi no longer sells eggs
This was shared by the corporate groups.
It was a pure measure of caution, and no further health impairment could be avoided, the communication said.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to aldi, which have been proven to be negatively tested for fipronil-containing anti-lice.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency with his customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of your e-commerce start-up with your employees, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promise anonymity, some workers do not trust the process.
“There was never any consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She has called people from outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to deal with C-suite executives and contact the Board directly.
“They now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company,” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better understanding of what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a company’s heat card that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low consent results - so that you can drill why.
Companies come to see that there is a need to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won’t become the next Uber involved in scandal since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could own more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial technical website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of Uber case in miscredit this year.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized “puls-” surveys, collect confidential answers in real-time, and view the heat cards of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is affiliated, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The Court of Public Opinion has recorded the regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or treats itself in a dishonest way, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate centers.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company center, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often a horror and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now, as the company employs Convert, problems previously identified and addressed by executives who sat in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly, such as discrimination, harassment, or insidious practices.
“I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree experience with employment,” said Vitrano, who is leading Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
“And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes”
Companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took time for the “social media to come to their right” that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thus raising the entire capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
“If people are happy to be in a company, they feel that their voices belong and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful,” said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and the use of employees, it is no wonder you will find support.
The data about employee engagement is important according to the experts of the workplace culture.
But the data is useless if the manager of a company does not take any measures.
In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may be expected that change is on the way.
And if the change doesn’t come fast enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointment and discourage employees.
“If you are asking for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Council, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that rely too much on data collection.
“If you don’t follow, employees will ask themselves, “Have you really heard me?
Do you care about it?
And if you don’t care, why should I?”
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, says Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganise several teams within the company through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights on employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bond between workers in an industry known for high turnovers.
“If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people,” Vitrano said.
“And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the browns
It goes on to 23 a.m. when a lot of UCLA football players are having fun on one side of the team’s new field of exercise on campus.
Some have pulled out their tricotober parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled at summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 a.m.
“This is a real Tretmühle for the boys the next three days,” said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA trainings should start at 19:15 to meet the already completed schedules of players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day on which the Bruins moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras carried out six games in Westwood practical exercises.
20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their launch against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA’s change of rules, even if they added another point to the players’ busy routes.
“We put this huge burden on them for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora said.
\"And they just pushed it through, they're putting themselves on, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great.
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, given the clear lines of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been entrusted with footballs that spaced a protective network behind a torpost, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora roomed that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
“We’re going to use our security,” Mora said.
“This is a real problem, and it’s not a long time to think that people are renting a room there and then setting themselves up to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I don't worry too much.
We have a plan -
Facebook Wants to Intensify Fact Review in the Fight Against False News
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party fact reviewers and show their results under the original post, said the world’s largest online social network on Thursday. It’s one of its efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to recognize possible false messages and send them to fact reviewers who may be shown results of the fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they have also influenced U.S. presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories in advance of the May presidential elections, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as before the September elections.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to finding out what stories of fact reviewers of third parties are being challenged, people want more context to make well-founded decisions about what they read and share,” Sara Su said in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the “combined article” and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Create a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In its recent past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a slump for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a moop-haired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
“I think it’s so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years,” he says mildly.
“What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand.”
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpected emotionally.
“I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobians,” he says.
“This is his thumb print!
Letters are always smelling for smoke, for at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he himself were there.
I love the Archive.
For someone who has been so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months — to be honest: I overrated my welcome greetings a little — this seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian “new” castle, searching through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in burial.
He walked through the terrain and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapekeepers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank “Whiskey and starting to write.”
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was only given full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just began to take care of the archive he described as “hundreds of years in which aristocrats said, “Oh, throw it on the roof floor.”
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing who owned what: “You might think that land conflicts would be boring,” says Rhodes, “but there was a birch to have the two families burned.
Boys, let everything go its way.
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to penetrate into English history on a wider basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant rebellion of 1381.
“There is a record of a riot that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled ‘Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex’,” says Rhodes.
“The peasant rebellion began in this area and I thought a riot was a good start.
Perhaps the two of them are connected.
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the history of the Jesuit pater, which the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is portrayed, who staged his own funeral by filling a sarg with stones (a discovery made only years later when his sarg was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: “The men seem to be pretty Gauners, always making debts and spending money on things they couldn’t afford.
Other generations of Darrell people solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys, with a talent to advertise them.
After the end of its use in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämenmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been restored by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
“I was sad to go again,” he says.
It was like, “Oh, now I have to be done with the damn life again.”
Campaign launched: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf
With the envelopment of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to launch a new roof brand (rundview of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team at Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwachth as the highlight of the campaign.
“It’s too nice for us.
Or, the creators of the action have been asking on the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel since yesterday.
\"We don't really think that (of course!) - write on their yesterday-related website.
“But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city.
The action is more than just a logo and a slogan.
\"It is true to make a single promise, one that the city has an indisputable single-position feature.
Finally, she competes with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new roof mark and the campaign a mean five-digit amount.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Each year in early August, Ankara advises the Supreme Military Council (YAS) on retirements and promotions in the officer body.
So did this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting took place no longer in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
Under the presidency of the head of government, the five vice-premiers, as well as the Minister for Defence, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs, took part in the consultation.
So the civilians in the YAS were in excess.
In the military, the government attracts the demons.
Hulusi Akar chief general remains in office, but the commanders of the Army, the Air Forces and the Navy have been decommissioned.
Since the failed coup, the head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a wire puller of the coup attempt.
486 persons who were to be directly involved in the coup attempt have been traded in Ankara since this week.
As early as the day after the coup, Erdogan had referred to the trial of overthrow as “God’s gift,” giving him the opportunity to completely clean the forces.
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper Hürriyet published an article with the headline “Unhappy in the Military Headquarters”
In the General Staff, there were concerns because of an increasing “Islamization” of the army, which, among other things, manifested itself in the removal of the cap-towel ban for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The Great Cleansing of the Army and the Security Forces goes on anyway.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 state servants fire by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had damaged the military.
The generals used to be the actual masters of the country.
Three times they relied on their role as guardians of the worldly state order.
After his 2002 election victory, Erdogan pushed the military's power back step by step, not least by appeal to the European Union's reform regulations.
Former officers say Erdogan deliberately drives forward an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine “Vocal Europe,” a prominently unnamed officer, who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army would be “full extremists and Salafists” in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not leave the nato cold.
No doubt there are doubts in the alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army.
The management structures and operational skills are \"slow\" - say NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the Green Card rules, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
He plans to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary working permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the US spends its citizens from other countries’ Green Cards.
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application framework will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate route for racing shuttle
Time and again, over the past few months, the future of the racing shuttle has been disputed - now it should go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, the Marode route on which the tourist train runs is to be built.
In order to ensure the future of the racing shuttle in the long term, construction work on the route will begin this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
“With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this important connection for tourism,” Secretary of Transport Klaus Sühl said on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route was about €2.5 million.
Of that sum, the country took 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently finally agreed, explained Sühl.
The Ministry and the Zuidthüringen Railway as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
“This is why the schedule, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated,” Sühl said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company will be concluded for a duration of 11 years.
This means that the race climbing shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rensteig shuttle is a popular train connection between Ilmenau and Rensteig railway stations, especially among tourists.
Over the past few months, pilot operations have tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The route is also highly structural in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just as you thought it could not get even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots comes to mind.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an experienced professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the breastwart, and the type of fingernail.
“People make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we’ll get to see them a lot more often,” Mr. Sharkey said when publishing his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also “adjust” his robots according to his beliefs, and choose everything from the robot’s eye color to the form of the breastwarts to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will be even more disturbing as many robots have the “personalities” that a Stepford woman would look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as “Frigid Farrah” that gives the impression of shyness and “Wild Wendy” with a “adventure” personality.
\"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible - swears the website of True Companion.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods over the course of the day - quite like real people!
She may be tired of being fixed on conversation or she may be \"in mood\"
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise in sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subjugated female properties, the plays on rape, when one steps towards frigid (heated here: resisting) Farrah, worry one most.
On his website, True Companion compares Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
“If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no roxxxy,” he said on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a Fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their growing popularity, they still remain provisionally on the edge of consumer culture.
But what goes through from the edge zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain intersection that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, where there is a president in the White House who has vowed to attack women sexually.
The most horrendous aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') is not the graphic images, the swallowed bodies and the exposed eyes, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it doesn’t feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible (even with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human that they are following the movement of a real body.
But, on the point, when it comes to their “personalities,” the robots do not represent real women.
You cannot separate yourself from your companion or simply leave.
They have no assignment or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission.
In other words, you are a fallen slave.
Or to express it in the speech of 2017: Women of Service
Trump's big performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the concept of sound human understanding
It has become a landmark of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the U.S. electorate have also split families in small format.
In the United States, there were newspapers on how to deal with Trump’s horror of elective relatives.
We are all allegedly stricting ourselves to allow our filter blasts to be placed.
Less noticed is Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York City.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relationship she had been involved with for decades because of politics, is suddenly and completely unique on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing for the dining table, but I am also aware that this also poses significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disturbing effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are referring to the gruesome possibility that one day his mats will no longer kick us off.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” Republicans of the right wing, which suddenly appears to be an understanding of reason at once compared to its standards.
Today, I find myself experiencing an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of the obnoxious - the dog on the car roof, which is 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax statement looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, are indeed one of the very mild crimes.
When Trump goes, the Republican’s next candidate must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don’t need a caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are bitter and the animals twist themselves to look at their own shoulders with fear - extremely windowy and the climbing music gives this a remarkable way.
So many clichés of a city are disappointing: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not satisfy the dream.
Fifty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not actually a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a major circuit in northern London.
However, the Central Park Carousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two years, an 11-year-old and two women can go on it in the 40s and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced to evaluate my “experience” with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% drink money - this to buy something about the store table.
This not only leads to a slowing down of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to introduce personality into a situation where no one is required.
The poor woman in the shop was apologizingly bordering, while I was tired of making the experience of enriching my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius Moved Out of Prison With Breast Pain
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was hospitalized because of the treatment of cuts at his wrists, which he suffered after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first murder sentence.
He killed stone camp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting them on several occasions through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder who hid in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year imprisonment of Pistorius Appellate, of which they say they are too cautious.
The National Criminal Prosecution Authority said that it will raise opposition to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the opposition can be heard this year.
Pistorius is at risk of increasing his punishment to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth-class students from the foothills and courthouses were released into the holidays and into the further schools.
Three of the released students will go to high school in the future, four in the real school.
School director Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental borough in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of school release, the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken farm, but then was released into freedom.
To this end, the coiner Schar performed a musical entitled “The Adler in the chicken yard”
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it be eaten by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken kitchen, a small eagle emerged.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him was shattered, and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain.
Then the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young gockels wearing cylinders for bets.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The little animal is different from the other young animals, but belongs to it.
He will never be like a chicken.
Its purpose is to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted in her new school.
It was followed by a thank-you word to the students, former school principal Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps in on lessons, and the parents’ representatives.
The kitchen time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She left her students very uneasy after two years of teaching, because it had been a really great time.
Finally, they could rely on the fourth graders.
At the end of the day, all students had a song of summer time and vacation.
In this case, great joy broke out among the children.
For the new school year, eight first-class students have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal campsites in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted from television, said.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegal people were arrested in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is currently underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have intensified control of the free camp and impose considerable fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the affected ones need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Should diesel drivers participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
At the Diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They should improve the exhaust-gas behaviour of Euro 5 emissions cars and, in part, Euro 6 emissions.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
“The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have smuggling software,” says Anja Smetanin.
Its retrofitment has ordered the Power Supply Office (KBA).
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the next few months, but have not yet mentioned a precise date.
Daimler has announced to write to any person affected.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done in its framework.
How long should the conversions be in total?
“Several to say,” Smetanin says.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on political pressure.
“Because we’ve seen that car manufacturers do not act on environmental issues so far,” he said.
How long should the update last?
The refurbishment itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
Timers may be able to get an appointment.
What do car drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises you to wait.
Perhaps foreign manufacturers would look after, according to Smetanin.
Is there a massive price loss of Euro-4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of this.
But in the regions where driving bans are threatening.
In rural areas, there is so far no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises you to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamourous events in Washington.
The first award under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prize winners does not want to come out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honours.
The awards will be handed over in early December.
U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and, together with his wife Melania, will participate in the ceremony.
The award-winning award-winning winner Lear announced with progressive TV series had already announced that he would not participate in the gala.
The New York Times said: “This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights — even withdrawing the resources — and that burdens me.”
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she will use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former prize winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslags Stadtbaumeister, will retire in the coming year.
The office has already been written out - suitable applicants are, however, rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work still makes him great fun, as he gives in the press talk.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he wonders that so far no application has fulfilled the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next possible time.
Thus, while taking into account the regular termination periods, there is still enough time for a workout.
Since Haslach acts as a lower construction law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must have appropriate conclusions.
Because this function will definitely keep the city.
If they could no longer fill them, the citizens would have to drive to Offenburg for advice.
But citizens are close to the city and it itself is important, says Wacker, who reports of a good operating climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have been gathered, looking back at Wacker with pride.
\"We make the city worth living - he's safe about the construction office and his employees.
But also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz are about to take place.
The Kinzig Bridge between Bolenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium anation is still the subject.
Only the latter will beat the book with around 1.5 million euros, if we make it right, estimated Wacker.
“All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun -
For example, there is a large space for a city builder.
With Haslag’s own building and gardening, it is possible to respond to many quite flexible.
“You can move a lot, so Wacker, and the design of the green facilities is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under memorial protection, it is important to have an eye for what is appropriate - when new buildings are approved, the separating city builder emphasizes.
In any case, the city builder bears high responsibilities.
He's a builder, \"in the end everything is running over my table.\"
With care and coordination, he can count on longtime employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been with Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 10 years.
Also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: “We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place.”
Continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
Those who wish to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to provide a completed study as a graduate engineer or a bachelor with a specialist in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning law.
The city building office is subject to high and low construction, construction management planning, basic acquisition matters, administration of urban properties, urban farm with construction and urban gardening, as well as lower construction law authority including monument protection.
Casting bike on lines: South Railway route locked
According to police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B 116) on the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the nearest freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go out of two male killings and have been searching for them since the night hours.
Near the site, a pink-red roller and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses.
“This goes far beyond a Lausbubensreich,” said OBB spokesman Christoph Posch to APA.
Those or the perpetrators themselves would have put themselves at great risk and would also endanger train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the station and the plant, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement traffic, there could also be the danger of pönals of the train customers to the perpetrators.
In total, a “high” sum was made up, the speaker said.
The damage was re-resolved on Friday afternoon, and rail traffic on the South Railway route could be carried without disabilities.
Almost ten passenger trains had fallen off Friday morning, two of which involved long-distance traffic.
The goods did not fall out, but they had a delay.
According to ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch, around 200 meters above lines had to be exchanged.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammable intestine disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestine diseases.
The ominous condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach fractures and bleeding, recurring or bloody breakthroughs, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not enter the body.
cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation, an inflammatory intestine disease can result.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacteria in their joints.
And the bacteria need tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have a link between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells.
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less flammable gut environments if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctor Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but who had been accommodated separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the stomach microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that usually live in the stomach gut tract.
The intestines of the mice were sequenced DNA and six types of bacteria were found present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing from the mice.
mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a intestine microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria impacted the immune system, researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid, without the bacteria, to unrefined immune cells isolated from the mice.
Immune cells developed into tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-milch acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the lining of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach intestine tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan side products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory intestine disease.
She said: “The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed to Nemanja Matic a “Genie”
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a 'genie', believing Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Chelsea's 40 million pounds signature began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid started on Tuesday, and impressed on the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira appeared to be in favour.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the Blues preparation Asia tour and created only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks — he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
“We will help him to be ready sooner than later.”
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already performed a “fantastic work” to meet three of its four recompenses.
“Three out of four to get, I thank the club for that,” he added.
“I’ll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they’ve given themselves a great deal of effort.
Boeing - painting - Dreamliner in the sky
The U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted a dream liner's Silhouette in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle, Washington, U.S.A., but the drawing began in Marquette, Michigan, and moved in the form of a dream liner across the U.S., which is several thousand kilometers.
The action took 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dream liner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such ad.
So the number 787 and Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New depth for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
How the Wind Turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still the head of SPD, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked at Berlin with some concern.
Only no stork from the central party, just no counter-wind from the federal party - is the most important desire of the electoral fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees from the Willy-Brandt House have been observing the events in the SPD-controlled state capitals with growing commotion.
What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwind.
It was deep.
One after the other.
According to the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
“This once again shows that red green can’t be trustedly governed,” said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprise group exit of a Greens decommissioned the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) has crashed into a serious crisis.
Five months before the election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Country Manager Michael Kellner has asked the late low-Saxon Green Order Every Twesten to return their mandate.
The transition to CDU means a clear falsification of the voter's will.
Each issue must immediately return its mandate - the federal manager and election leader of the Greens told the editorial network Germany (RND).
“It can’t be all true,” a SPD election fighter says, as the new Hiobs message reaches the party’s headquarters on Friday.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is present after the violation of Green MPs Elke Twesten to CDU without its majority of governments.
It is the provisional peak of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD countries.
And no one knows what comes next.
The Misere began with the unexpected significant defeat in the nation's nation in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed down the associates of his time.
After the Landtag elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That was the case, and it all got worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Taumeln, the Düsseldorf-Pleite skin the party smoothly died.
Mühsam grabbed up again in the weeks that followed.
Then, when they had created new courage, the G-20 summit from Hamburg came.
And with him came the next low.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country chief, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonic while burning his city.
And because in crisis communication after that, he did so pretty much everything wrong, which can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has struggled for his political survival.
That's what Stephan Weil is doing.
Because of the VW exhaust business and its role in the Supervisory Board, the low-Saxon Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
My survey values were added.
Despite this, or perhaps, because of this, in the past few weeks, we have tried to put more and more accents in the covenant.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also remained unhindered by fellows in the area of Martin Schulz.
They gave it because they promised to stabilize the party by Weil.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
Because of this, there is no fault in the internal party of the low-Saxon greens.
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.
Sometimes the companions try to keep their own lines closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here, above all, against the late Parliamentary Twesten.
“It’s unbearable and democratic, as Mrs. Twesten puts her own career interests on the interests of everyone else,” says Matthias Miersch, head of the party’s links in the SPD National Day Group, the Editorial Network of Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but because of the country list of the low-Saxon Greens, the Dutch MP continues.
The logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD National Day Group, complains of an undemocracy maneuver.
“The voter’s will four years ago was clear: People made Stephan Weil as Prime Minister,” says Oppermann, who leads the SPD as a top candidate in the federal election, the RND.
“Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU deputy falsifies the election result,” Oppermann said.
He called for the background to be clarified.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further promises made by the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding funds for local cores III
Those who want to renovate in the years to come can soon get support from the country.
In addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives informed STEG city development on Wednesday in Receptionen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what has happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been remodeling areas.
At that time, from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the area of refurbishment II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a success project - it is ultimately important to promote internal development as well, and not only to open new construction areas.
On 4 April, it was informed by the President of Karlsruhe that there will be a remedial area III.
The funding amounted to 833,333 euros, of which 500,000 were received from the country, the rest from the municipality.
How does an area of renovation come about?
One will, according to Schindler, investigate where the “real old” houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether or not in the planned area there is any interest to renovate.
Where appropriate, the area limits could then move again.
The STEG met Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the Federal Country Program (Social City) in the context of which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of downtown cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out with respect to object-related, i.e. per plot.
The area of refurbishment would then finally be established as a statute.
The period of approval for the funding has continued from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
By September this year, however, the stock collection would only be carried out, in the context of which a questionnaire for filling up the area involved in the renovation area would be given.
In November or December, the legislation is to be made as far as possible, so that the renovations can be started in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is about assessing and deciding the city-building wrongs, when being renovated and to what extent.
There will be a reparation note in the basic book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann will come to his own receptions and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel emphasized that a significant success factor for the project is the participation of the stakeholders.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be mailed to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the \"building and property arch\" in which it concerns, among other things, the building state and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the 'housekeeping and housing arch', information on the size, distribution and residents of a living room can be made.
The blue “operation arc” is only filled out when business spaces are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel points out that a filled questionnaire is not at the same time a request for conveyors.
In addition, new building measures are not eligible.
Schindler still emphasized that the distribution of the conveyors in accordance with the \"Windhund principle\" function - who comes first, mingles first.
You can't make any funding for later,
At the end of the project, photos of the project \"Placeskern II\" were still shown to make the present a repair \"delightful\".
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come in with a hand movement in house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and pointing finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by its company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and only lasts for 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company also wants to change the locks of homes and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the tax.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000 according to the report of the military that was left to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and White House executives made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht of Maine, a Wisconsin firefighter car and a Mississippi forklifter.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, almost 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the helicopter's operation.
“I just wanted you to be aware of it because it’s such an unusual event with high visibility — the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event to his supervisor, Deputy Marine Commander for Aviation.
The message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7:00 a.m. on the South Lawn for the event at 15:00 p.m., and remained until the lawn was sent between 18:00 and 21:00 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second team would be required for the return flight due to the restriction of the service hours.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground at the plane during the time.
The records provided by the TIME did not reveal clearly whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Datasets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could hurt the determination.
“A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case,” the commander wrote.
“Calls as if you’re locked,” replied the deputy commander.
The event “Made in America” was named by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But also official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave a boost to the reform of health reform, which was under way in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But requesting their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February, when the President's plane was carrying out taxi services in the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the President's aircraft by its predecessors.
“The White House is excited by the show ‘Made In America’, which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials,” said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walter.
HMX-1 occupations often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Lawn to decommission U.S. Presidents in the White House with precise centimeter sets.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 carried out 58 landings in the White House.
The flight for the “Made in America” event counted when training the flight crew for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew for 11 hours this day for non-presidence support missions.
The White House said the taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other requisites presented at the event.
A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to U.S. Department of Defense’s hourly tariffs for the 2017 budget year, however, the DoD fee for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate.
“The cost of taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading,” Walters said.
“These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual budgets.
According to a 2015 RAND study, discount rates for DoD do not include staff costs, but consider the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract closure.
At that time, the former White House press spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present things produced in America this week,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are dependent on it.
And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to emphasize that.
It was not clear if Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he was sitting in the driver’s seat of a firefighter car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and shrugged with the media about his own fleet of company products.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” said the president, “I have three of them.”
TC BW News Before Knife Background Task
Top rider of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga joins the table third searchesdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will arrive in Kiel tomorrow at the table third searchsdorfer SV.
Despite five matches, the top rider of the Second Tennis Federal League has been given the sense of reality.
Team chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
“This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Especially in the back positions, I think the team is very good.
Class and stability at Searchsdorfer SV mainly ensure imports from the high north.
“The Danes and Finns can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles - says Zay with views of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Soren and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (All Denmark).
“It’s going to be hard for us as always.
You also need a good portion of happiness.
The Neuss team for the trip to the high north stands practically.
His debut for Blue-White could give Maxime Janvier.
If the challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga party, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) will be the first to play in the tournament in Czech Liberec.
The unbeaten Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball yesterday with the white rose Andrei Vasilevsky.
However, he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club at Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
For the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching team around Marius Zay will fill the frame.
How America can damage the OMV
Really fortunately, Donald Trump did not act when he put his signature under the law to make sanctions against Russia on Wednesday night.
\"In his hast to adopt the law - the Congress has packed in a few \"constitutional rules\" - he ate.
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of the US proposal.
At the same time, the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Accordingly, investors from the domestic OMV have since been troubled, who, together with other European companies, have funded the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies.
The Drohculisse is huge.
However, it is too early for an estimate of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself had to bring the sanctions to life by Executive Order.
Twelve weapons are at his disposal.
“The press,” he said, considered what could and could really hurt the group.
Narcos Staff 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel in the Netflix hit series will be put to the center.
Despite the second season of Narcos, which Pablo Escobar's Killer reveals, Netflix's series has not been over for a long time.
The staffs three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bad balances of the show.
With the third staff, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organisation of the world’s drug trade: the Cali-Cartell.
Led by four powerful patents, they operate — like a Fortune 500 company — only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the Kartell, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type who invites American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backward: The city has 46 kitchens
The city again organizes the Kita lunch table itself.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city's children's dayclubs.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban children’s day facilities (Kitas) again in its own direction.
For Sonja Pommerance, deputy director in the Youth Help field, this is a good news: “We all have been very pleased”
A caterer takes over this task and supplies fresh cooked.
The city operates 46 day resorts in the Krefelder area, in 44 children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past Kita year, 2800 children were sitting on the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
“Mittal meals are not just children who are cared for 45 hours of week, in the Kita at lunchtime,” explains Pommerance.
“The offer also applies in 35-hour care if children stay up to 14 o’clock.”
46 part-time staff have kitchen service from September 1st: They heat the supplied foods, supplement them for salad, raw food and fruit, serve the meal individually, pour out the food, room, wash and clean the kitchen.
“The workers are assigned to a Kita,” says Pommerance.
The size - there are two-group facilities as well as seven-group facilities - decide on the range of hours.
“The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team,” says Pommerance satisfied.
“So they are much stronger integrated and it is easier for the kitaline to implement educational concepts.”
It’s also about: healthy nutrition and cooking.
“The children should help prepare the food.”
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful.
Even for the kids.
“They have a well-known force in the Kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people.”
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
In addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance, this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has shown itself to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self-government and foreign administration for the city, says the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are being re-appointed.
“But these hours, about 750 people in the education area don’t fall into weight at all,” says Sonja Pommerance.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting director of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will run in the council elections in the provinces. Three women are candidates for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate in uncompromisingly and are joined in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has issued threats against an election process that coincides with the transition from international combat operations to a consulting role.
This year, for the first time, elections will be passed peacefully by a democratically elected government.
Haysom said a strong role for women will still strengthen Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl of
Two young men aged 19 and 23 will have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-old, who was with friends at the Colping Street, at 14:55 a.m. because they wanted to phone the girl's cell phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but what was wrong.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.

GMB concern over investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to assure managers of McVitie’s long-term commitment to production in her work in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company has waived about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which manufactures in addition to other products Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives — as first experienced — would have changed if their activities had changed.
In a letter to the company's branch director, GMB Scotland McVitie's urged \"remember that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be pushed forward\"
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and the labour market focuses heavily on the local community and the Glasgow area, an important pillar for humane employment in an area with high unemployment and social disability.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a thriving production presence at McVitie.
A spokesperson for Pladis said: “The branch leader at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, are constantly checking our businesses - and this applies to all of our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross location, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
If our operations change at the site, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this.
Did the PSG Barcelona warned about Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga likes to repent her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not leave in her persecution of Neymar after she has issued an offer of £189 million to trigger its release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record crash?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning for 89 million pounds to Manchester United last season.
After the end, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and the world’s highest paid professional athlete. PSG offers wages of over $500,000 a week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board is that the club has always given his best to care for him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president of this view?
When Manchester City announced interest in Blaise Matuidi’s signing in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any association that wanted to sign one of PSG’s best players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we’ll be in opposition to them, we’ll contact their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, it will have consequences.
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti in the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to depart under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prize offers for Neymar.
Roller thrown and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately threw a roller in the royal field road before the estate number 30 and thus caused damage to the vehicle's clothing of more than 200 euros.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for clues.
For an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car came to him on his rideway, the driver of a VW Touran had to leave and touch the lead plank.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum, with his VW at 19.55 p.m., was on the B 215 from Stolzenau, coming towards Reading.
In the area of the site of Stolzenau, a car arrived at him on his way, so he had to diverge to the right.
At the same time, the touran driver touched the lead plank.
There was damage to the car.
The driver of the opposite car, a Mercedes Benz, had picked up a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident damage, it may well be that the Mercedes driver did not notice the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the cause vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761/92060.
Interview: \"Domspatzen report relieved Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger\"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuses relieved Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger.
That's what author and historian Michael Hesemann meant.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesperson for the reform movement “We are the Church,” explained after publication to the German Press Agency, expecting the former Regensburg Bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the retired Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.
It would be a great service to the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express deep regret over their own neglects or their then false assessment of the proceedings.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticised that when reporting on violence in domspatzens, it is measured with a “second degree.”
With regard to the incidents in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was “slandish and shameful acts” that had to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the “Grad Medial Manipulation” was evident, as author Lucetta Scarafia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.
“The custom of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to consider it normal,” writes Scarafia.
Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian broadcaster: “We like to go to the church and that’s a great meal.
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth “slaughts were a very normal means of education” to be done with aggravating children, as I was one of them.”
They found it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the abuse cases, Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.
Full of injustice, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger wrote the memoir - My Brother of the Pope - (translated into 12 languages).
“I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection,” says Hesemann, “because everything had nothing to do with him, he values the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report submitted by the Bishop of Regensburg with the explanation lawyer Ulrich Weber?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s, with high plausibility, victims of assaults, 67 domspatzens.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: “In summary, it can be said that in many cases physical and mental violence were applied by Domkapellmeister R..
Especially in the case of high emotionality, punishment for students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore even link positive memories with him in many cases in spite of violence.
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the \" incident of violence exercise in the protection orders at the Regensburg Domspatzen\" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmaster Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his “humanity.”
On the other hand, he also appears as a Cholerian and perfectionist, who became handy when a domspatz musically did not bring top performance.
As his biographer, how do you evaluate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.
He is dedicated to just eight pages and is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of middle-aged or co-foundership in the horrendous cases of sexual abuse.
Violence in pre-school also occurred outside of its sphere of effectiveness.
You can at all object to him, too late, or have not taken first indications seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he acted was felt by virtually all the respondents as, literally, \"salvation\" \"heavens\" and \"better world\".
The vast majority of his pupils, Georg Ratzinger, also presents a very excellent witness, describing him as a “warm-hearted”-like-like--right- “competent- and understanding-like teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies, and bonbons, and was always surrounded by grapes of children.
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has led to angry outbursts.
Not only did he knock with chairs and throw the key bundle on the ground, but he also distributed earrings and pulled all too cold boys to the hairs or ears, he admitted himself years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for it.
It must be said, however, that such education methods of education were widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, among parents as in teachers.
Do you know any such methods of training?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a worldly school, a state high school.
Compared with what is actually going on in this report, namely the abominable sexual abuse and the excess of violence in pre-school, these are freely bagatelles.
It is asked if it is not more to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that a lot of the media are just falling on him.
Many of those who never understood him are still working with the Bavarian Pope.
The truth is, however, that the report relieved Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, a lot was reported in connection with the report on the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Will Georg Ratzinger also be put to the test in the final report of any involvement or co-wisership with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Very clearly no.
No one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have trusted the Domkapellmaster.
Not even the parents were consecrated.
“I’ve never been able to talk to my father or my mother about it,” said one person who was a deputy to the others, “It was all very embarrassing.”
The real problem with exposing sexual abuse was, but it is that most victims remain silent from shame.
If they don’t even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.
How, then, does the Domspatzen student assess Ratzinger's role in the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A surveyed student put it this way: “As regards sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it ... also stands for really absurd to assume that out of account for it ... bows have opened intrusive or clearer or even more clear than to their parents, board leaders, trust teachers, etc.
Talking to him about sex ... - unimaginable -
Thus, the report concludes: “The fact that students and/or their environment were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation.
As for sexual abuse, then, Georg Ratzinger is free of any co-wisership.
Thus, he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought to the ad.
Therefore, there is also no reason to connect his good name with these opposing crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, a lot of \"walttexzessen\" was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Former Domkapellmaster Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report “Wegschauen”.
Does he have to live with this predestination?
Michael Hesemann: That’s the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But this is, in turn, an abuse of the report.
There is clean separation: between the preschool and the high school of domespats, between sexual abuse and violence and, we say, other allegations.
In addition, the report has been dealing with incidents since 1945, including four decades when Georg Ratzinger was not a choir leader of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible pedagogues, the cases in which buttons of sadistic teachers were regularly schemed and painted, and among them, were made disheartened, all of which took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions had to have prevailed.
But with them, Domkapellmaster Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with, for he only got to face the boys when they were already at Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as the vast majority of witnesses emphasize, the topic of ‘Prior School’ was tabu.
One was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and even “paradise” conditions for many.
What else was at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: While discipline existed, it was not a sadistic violence.
And that is also true of Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that “many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore even linked positive memories with him in many cases in spite of violence,” he said.
This is the most important thing that remains to be seen.
But despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the state in pre-school.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and from the processes at a school where he was not acting and responsible, (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again by 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears before the states?
Michael Hesemann: No, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this he points out to them that “in pre-school, the penalty will continue to be practiced”
In view of the risk of negative press releases, he recommends urgent entry.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when criminal penalties were long banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey zone, as each of us probably still knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected might have been exasperated or dramatized and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded.
You can't even say he'd always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the criminal punishment at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the “falls trick of anachronism,” that is, the danger of assessing past by today’s moral standards.
That's where the princess is.
But this does not apply, of course, to sexual abuse, which was deplorable at all times and not to what was broken in preschool of contradictions and violence on innocent children’s souls, that is far beyond what was usual at the time.
That's all very terrible and I'm glad it's finally worked out.
But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all of this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, so to speak, and to draw ears and ears were widely used in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then prohibited, he also strictly held to it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger have in the discussions with you for the book “My Brother the Pope”?
Did the subject of criminal punishment also come to the language?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the Domspatzens played only a secondary role.
However, I don't know if he led a strict regiment there.
However, it must also be said that without this perfectionism, without the demand of necessary discipline, it would have been impossible for him to form an institution of world rank from the more nationally-known Regensburger Domspatzens, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With Keksen and Bonbons alone, one does not even make up a resurgence of a great singer and face every success, no matter what the subject, but always discipline, passion and self-conquering.
What kind of person have you experienced Georg Ratzinger in conversations with her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and repeatedly experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heart-wrenching people, of whom one cannot imagine that he could only do something to a plane.
I regularly get involved with how many former domspatzens are still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly keep in touch with him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he once was strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them close to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, sure, that might be - but was also a loving respecter to whom they still look today and to whom they should worship.
And again, please, it is clear: everything that is rejected is educational methods that were then in the classroom.
We can be happy that we have overcome this time for a long time.
But it is highly unjust to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial sin bock.
There is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious.
Because the report, which has just been published, relieved him.
Now, the insurgent areas, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merit and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany’s still no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzens, would finally leave them at peace.
