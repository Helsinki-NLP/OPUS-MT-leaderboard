The romantic shooting is in the video:
DFB-Chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
“This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that once you get into the conversation, you also talk to him about why he felt that one or the other of these things was as it is in his statement,” said Grindel in the football podcast “Phrasen mäher” the picture newspaper.
Despite the months-long debate about the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of 92-fold national player Özil.
“I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also went on to say at some point that this would be the case,” Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified him by not defending him from racist enemies during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil that this was not ready for a conversation with Federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn’t want to build a pressure, but he knows it from football so that if “you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it to his coach and I feel it’s harmful that this conversation hasn’t happened so far”
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartessüdlung burning
At 14:13 p.m., the fire department Linz was alarmed with a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly via the Schrebergaartsidling, there was danger in delay.
The firefighter broke out and found the cottage in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed virtually for the entire purpose and fire extinguished to the required extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had set up an battery for charging on lunch.
This might be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to firefighter, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be determined, as is the cause of fire.
However, he may have been considerable, because the owner had many items in his garden hut.
An angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open street
What has Lindsay Lohan only driven to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to drive the children away from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, \"Herbie: Fully Loaded\") has streamed itself live, as she apparently wants to rid a family in Moscow of the children.
This reports the U.S. portal “TMZ” and releases a partial update of the stream.
Here you can see \"For luck kissed\" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan goes out of a car and goes to a homeless family that she wants to have become a refugee family from Syria.
As the family escapes from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She refuses to engage in adult child trafficking.
For all of this, she does not provide evidence in the clip.
“The whole world is seeing this right now, Lohan is hearing in the video how she continues to track the family along the street.
She obviously tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be the apparently angry mother enough.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan misses an ear.
Under tears, the actress slanders how shocked she is - and she keeps the cheek.
What Lohan has moved to this action is currently completely unclear.

Audi: “Dieselgate” Work takes longer than planned
“The diesel task force is still there,” Peter Mertens told the industry newspaper’s development board “Automobile Week”
The imprisoned and retired Audi chief Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force will soon be dissolved.
“In the first quarter of 2018, all motor/drive combinations were expected to be tested,” he said.
Mertens now said: “At the beginning of July, we have reached an important stage goal in the process of working up the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi-Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens emphasized that the autobuilder has made “gravity organizational changes” so that such a scandal never occurs again.
On Friday, the VW Supervisory Board held a decision on Stadler's future and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities accuse the Audi chief of having approved the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after reporting of the emissions frauds.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
At present, the company is head of sales board Bram Schot as Commissioner of the Board of Directors.
Because of the change to the new exhaust and consumption test standard, WLTP had production failures at Audi, Schot said, \"Heilbronn's voice.\"
In principle, he sees a sinking demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8 produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment in itself is difficult,” he said.
Shot is based on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Greendel is seeking re-election - Lahm is scheduled to go to DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for office as DFB president in spite of criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair in the coming year.
“I’m doing my job and trying to make them as good as I can,” Grindel said as a guest at ZDF’s current sports studio on the early Sunday morning.
You always have to make a re-election, I'll do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association found it “remarkable” if after the addition for the football EM 2024, he would not have “Lust to work on the future project”
Grindel has been the head of association since April 2016 as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, which crashed over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB National Day on 27 September 2019.
The future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB Bureau, according to Grindel.
“I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that in this role he will also consult with the Bureau in the future and, of course, be warmly invited to provide his experience on sporting issues,” Grindel said.
In speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief, he did not want to participate.
As a result of the departure around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migration background will be sent an integration message from the DFB.
At present, this office of the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic is exercising, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
“If a non-migration background clearly influences society and football and says, “the issue is important, as we have to take care of it, that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our associations on site where integration needs to work,” Greendel said.
Take off correctly with half-sluggish scales
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat content.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the sausage.
He doesn't say anything about whether I replaced fat with muscles.

Rokas Giedraitis was the top 20 scorer of the dominated Berliners.
Ludwigsburg national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) also showed an appealing performance in his mandatory play debut before 9113 spectators.

A 26:1 run of the basketball quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Critique of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan urged the German government to deliver living supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathisers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and damage the German-Turkish friendship,” he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city centre of Cologne was partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were in use - including the sharp-sleeves.
The Islamic Association of Ditib is critical because it is considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
Global Citizen Festival: Music Against Poverty: Stars, Buhropes and Fear Second
Musicians like Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have won a joint concert at New York Central Park for more engagement in fighting poverty and disease.
\"Angaly wherever you can, Mendes said at the festival on the night of the Sunday before around 60.00 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations showed themselves on stage during the most hours of spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a fear second when many viewers held the noise of a surrounding metal barrier for shots, became afraid and tried to escape.
Soon panic broke out, and people ran into each other.
Seven spectators were easily injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed people off the stage.
“No one tries to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You are all safe.
Tickets for the “Global Citizen Festival” concert were available for free on the Internet every year.
Those who wanted to learn to read and spread text, photos, and videos on the global struggle against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there was cheer and applause from the audience - Buhruppe, on the other hand, for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
While this spoke together with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons on stage for more equality of men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had expressed herself in the U.S. Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court and had thus kicked many women in the head.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse until the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which rejects it.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations, after he faced two women who, according to their own information, experienced sexual assaults on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
“You can also come along with me at any time in a lift,” Flake said at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: Federal Government defends Rauswurf of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the ruse of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellor’s Office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had a t-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription “Freedom for Journalists” and had gone into the first series.
The t-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the image on Sunday.
It was about a disruption of the execution of the press conference.
The journalist’s action has caused a strong unrest, which is not acceptable.
He has therefore caused personal guardians to bring the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor's Office.
This applies entirely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten to be imprisoned for several decades.
Foreign journalists are also not sure of the Turkish authorities: it was not until early September that Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Finally, the cases of imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had been cared for for.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but in Turkey they still run processes against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and friendly, his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show produced by the NDR - Inas Nacht - is known for moist-frozen conversations at the Theke der Hamburger Hafenkneipe - Schellfischposten.
Moderator Ina Müller attacks some beer, some wine, or even more high-percent drinks with her guests to attract the mood and tongues.
Not a few promises are also used for the mandatory singing inserts.
On Friday another follow-up of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as “Sensor Hearts” - “Terror - Your Judgment” or “The Yellowest Day”
The Münchner got the trip to the high north, but it was not good at all.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely ringed on it, the eyes only two small slots.
The bed-selfie shows a fully-laid Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he has only a powerful cat.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not very serious - findings that he has now won: “Regel one: NIE goes to Ina’s night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sauce.
And Spritz.
And the round ovary, which throws ina by half three, also leaves.
Alcohol consumption is indeed in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans just posted a few tips to combat the downturn.
They ranged from instant breads, fish fractions or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others were just enjoying the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
As Ina Müller has survived the nightly plague, so far it is not known.
However, since she has been moderated the TV fun at the Theke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to have been clearly tested.
A beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight vandalism and unravel
The entry into the 36-mile-long railroad in the Red Köppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and waste.
Recipe against the grassy vandalism is sought, but solutions are hardly clear.
Scherben, cigarette clipping, garbage and unrat, demolated trash bins and now dismounted signposts - this is how long the entry with sitting group to the wheelway on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented.
For the preview of the rail bike path in the red-headed country, a more than infamous view.
The theme is for members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but others have been involved for a long time, according to the cycling officer of the city of Ulrich Wundernhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the Council for Road Transport.
There is no solution to it so far.
The proposals ranged from the installation of the seating group to the regular discharge of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
\"I think the latter would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible further activities - says desert garden.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the subject was also introduced to the local council.
Not only does the garbage drive cyclists and residents around - the sitting group is a regular meeting point for celebration on weekends.
Not only does it often go loud, the layers are also destroyed: dusts are torn out of the earth, garbages are demolated, shields are wrapped, seat furniture is embroiled.
Volunteers have been more often trained, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
However, the actions are only the verbal drops on the hot rock.
You are upset that the parking lot on the bike road in Treysa is meeting point for storage.
“As long as the entire cycle path is clearly focused here on the Haaße hill, the cyclist, who is now also concerned about the new bike station in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
“If they suffer the same fate, it will be very expensive.”
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: “Perhaps this puts the threshold much higher to grasp itself in common material.
However, this would suggest that a police force will soon pass.
In principle, desert hags wish to develop the haze hill.
He had to be more attractive.
With the frequency of the bike route so far, you can be very satisfied.
Tourism marketing is yet to be expanded.
Our bike route is very high-quality compared to others in Germany, according to the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klipper estimates the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There is no trace on the Haaese hill.
In the case of heavy traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of traffic flow, explains it.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but it is a problem for parents and especially for children.
Music Contest in the Cultural Station: The 'Kö von Hiltrup' and the Lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and together.
D is a song for Hiltrup - to offer is the appeal of the city’s offensive Hiltrup, in the “Music Contest for Large and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians”
A Contest - with eyebrows in the sympathetic Hiltruper family - as Karl Franke formed.
In fact, it soon became a familial associate at coffee and cake from the honorary officials of the Cultural Station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Unteit, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived albachter who lives in Hiltrup, the nine of the “Hiltruper Star Colors” three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland Kindergarten and finally Rich Weßling and the Blacks.
This Contest, said Mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not yet experienced that in other parts of the city.
What were the ingredients connected to?
At the locations, the Hiltruper See and the Marktallee found particularly common mention.
Rolf Ihmig cut the alley in his sledge-like song to the \"Kö von Hiltrup\"
The cultural station was also honored.
Time and again, it was about experiencing together in these places, especially Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke experienced the short remodeling breaks with short interviews with the interpretations or references to her creation.
So we learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
Franke learned from sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann that the recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed everything on YouTube.
“It’s not about winning,” Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomy.
For the favorites of the jury, however, there was something special - so that others could hear their songs too.
An entire CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untime with sound technician Schemmelmann.
More musicians can record a song: Hemig with his Hiltrup store, who impressed Franke particularly with his musicality, and the \"Lummerland-Rudel\": \"a very beautiful performance\" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children also appeared again at the finale - and even sounded “rightly good” without electronic support, as Franke said.
Guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, the entrance to the melody, and recognisable value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG High School and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had brought the event to life on the occasion of their ten-year existence.
She appreciated the event as a full success.
Everyone was “very satisfied” and “the atmosphere was good” in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: “Decrypto” in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side, there is a visible screen, there are four cards with keywords that you can use - the old trick with the red foil - only when you put them in.
Thus, it is guaranteed that the opposite side can read nothing from the same point of view.
For example, on the cards, read from left to right: “1st Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Wörfel.
\" Celebration Day \"
These are the terms that still need to be encrypted.
This is not to mention the terms, but the codes.
A player per team is the encryption player.
He is given a code card, which may be “3.4.2”.
It should be advised in “Decrypto” not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe, in this order and in this example, the terms \"worfs\" and \"windows\" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible; for this wins the match when he twice succeeds in cracking the code.
So the encryption officer notes and reads loudly: “Worships - for the throws, “Lose” as opposed to fasting; here, of course, there would also be something like “Party” possible and “Prag” because he has watched in the school and knows the window crash there.
This is how it goes for round, team for team.
While it is not known the terms of the opposite side, it can be more closely aligned with any indication given by the encryption agent there.
Perhaps mysterious, but not to be turned down, so the rescriptions should be, otherwise, making it unnecessary for his team.
The most cryptic to “Decrypto” is unfortunately the rule.
The players probably need to study it quite long and detailed until they can finally play.
The explanation video on Decrypto.info on the network makes it easier.
But who has first started out, will be fascinated at how much feeling is in this unlikely game.
Overall, however, \"decrypto\" is not as key as predecessors and genre primus codenames, which also gives an agent theme to a game of fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And when it comes to rates and not winning points, it can also easily find a version for two of them.
Kulmbach: Mann shows Hitler’s greetings and insults guests in the kneipe
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspection on the night from Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed the Hitler greeting in the Upper City of a passing police force, then later he also appeared in the Upper City in a knee when he harassed other guests.
After clearly alcoholizing the assigned space reference by the police, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach police inspection in the prison cell.
In the sobering state, it must also be criminally responsible for the use of anti-constitutional organizations.
Pressig was home to the Schublocks
The railway station in Pressig was the turning disk in the Frankenwald for decades.
A piece of railway history ended in 1991.
“When buffers broke into buffers, they heard it all the way through,” remember Georg Dinkel, who archived the history of the town and the railway station.
No one's right.
The brakes were also squeaking and the wagons were squeaking.
That was just a train.
Statements that are meaningful for Dinkels Home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain range to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 meters, has its skyscraper in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, former train and gunblocks were needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway operations facility with 21 lockers, training workshop, driving and railway championships.
“The heart was the rotary disk, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899,” explains Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, Railway Historian and 47 years of professional railways.
At the BW Pressig railway station, which was subsidized in 1968 Bamberg, Loks were also operated for the by-tracks Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonnenberg and Kronach - Nordhalen.
On 15 July 1950, the \"People's Journal\" reported of a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Ellocks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the route 1939 already minimized the need for train and thrust blocks.
Since 1977 they have only been used on freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 waves had been ranked in the month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were demolished, in 1991 the rest of it was destroyed.
Heidrich: “It is regrettable that you did not see a better use of the site, even in the traffic of goods,” he said.
At Pentecost 1989, the Nürnberg railway directorate celebrated a pumping station festival in Pressig for the 50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld.
\"There were 10,000 enthusiastic viewers here - remember Georg Dinkel.
Little later on.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were decommissioned, the ranking station Pressig was history.
“The rangers and shirts did the most difficult work in train transport, remembering Dinkel.
Every failure would have fatal consequences.
Why the Station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led for the conversion of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current images are here in the French-Plus article.
Kerber with catch success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the Beijing tennis tournament as before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against Frenchman Kristina Mladenovic.

The Swabbin is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series “Art and Enjoy” a special exhibition was opened in Middelehrenbach on the weekend.
With great ease, organizers and visitors registered to watch the ideal weather when the Dahlmann- Schmidt property, Mittelehrenbach, opened the Special Vernissage -Windspiel event.
It takes place under the roof of the Tourism Association around Walberla, as part of the series “Art and Enjoy”.
This opened its gates in the 15th year.
A large visitor address showed the fascinatingness of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Middelehrenbach.
Mr. Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the Vernissage.
He himself has been there for the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made himself a major organizer and artist, he made a name for himself.
A bit surprising but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he laid his task in proven, young hands with good future prospects.
Both have been actively involved in the selection of the artists in the past and have co-designed Flyer.
Also this year there is once again a 70 cent special stamp designed by them, available at each art station.
This year’s poster “Betzn autzn” can also be designed by Volker Hahn, which can be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high appeal of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler could be won from Nuremberg for the musical roundup.
During the walk through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly becomes aware that the title \"Windspiel performance\" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses playfulness.
It is made of metal or ceramics, often provided with colourful accents.
Even at the entrance of the property, visitors are expected on the right side of the “Glücksbaum” by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, colourfully lit, playful with 20 winds, 24 humbles and 24 alu tubes provided as a piece of sound.
With the sun that survives through the bushwork in the background, the object works in a manner that acts as a soft sun and invites you to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who is preferably dedicated in three dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
On half the way, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work “The Wind the Heavenly Child.”
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy designs of sound, cement and stainless steel.
The theme of \"Windspiel-verschung\" is to be used for slendering through the versatile art exhibition.
By 31 December 2018, the special exhibition can be attended.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singer celebrates 50th birthday celebration
1968 - This was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians also made their insolence air at that time.
At least five of them.
They didn’t want to be partout with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir — Cäcilia — there should be no more Sangslife in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in the Tinnenbusch, they raised the MGV 68 Albachten from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated great in the House of Meeting.
\"It's going to be full today -- without President Jürgen Holsteige, and he should keep right.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The climber marches.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under screen control of Axel Büring is well suited in league three.
No trace of squeezers or frogs, the Independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against the city competitor BW Aasee is good.
“That wasn’t clear, but we’ve already left impressions,” said the somewhat satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately added: “This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not unhappy, on the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday celebration by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game delineated.
Yes, the result is actually an optical deception.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
“If you’re going to get the goal, that’s how a game can kick — white büring from years of experience.
Finally, the USC, with its routine forces, made everything clear and brought the full yield to the end.
“We all know who’s in such a Derby on the other side.
That doesn't break the fuck.
I’ve seen a good volleyball phase — Annacker didn’t do it with the 0:3 — and went over to the agenda immediately.
Where the journey goes for the Independents, after just three days of play, it seems unimaginable.
“It’s just too early,” says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: “The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
With regional league volleyball, this is not nearly comparable - in the fourth league, they don’t want to go down their look.
Should the West not be polluted in the next few weeks, they must look up.
However, a first balance sheet can only be pulled after ten, eleven matches.
On Saturday, we'll go to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became the star on the dream ship.
Now she openly speaks about the fact that the series might have been a co-indictor of her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the Chief Hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the \"Traumschiff\" made Heide Keller (76), but on January 01st, 2018, she went on board forever.
The series that made them the star could be responsible for their failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013) with which she was married for ten years.
“That could have been a reason too.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world, and many of my admired colleagues took me to the height of my eyes, telling Keller in a conversation with the “image on Sunday”
At first, she was always only \"the wife of Hans von Borsody\", but that changed with the dream ship.
For now, the journalists just called at Heide Keller.
“I don’t know if he liked it so well,” he said.
She thinks it's possible that her then husband might have been very jealous of her, but \"like many men, Hans also gave talks about problems and feelings.\"
Keller has always tried to be the only correct one for Hans von Borsody and he didn’t want to know my fears.
This means in good German: I've changed - as she explains further.
She has always felt like “not being good enough for him.”
He saw in me an animated woman, whom I had never really been, even though I sometimes appeared cheerful and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever...
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, “although I was afraid that it might also go wrong a second time.”
On the day before the standing mourning, I sat in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why has it never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller has shown herself love at the time — as shown in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I have gone far too naively to love.
The night trapper, which regularly explores the city’s nightlife in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has been at ZFF opening party this time.
Our falter is not a moth, but a little light-headed.
And the glaring glow in which a green carpet is immersed on the six-legged spot blinds him over a fee.
But it is still film festival, as more or less celebrities want to be in the headlight.
So on this late Thursday evening, he wanders over the square to make it easier in the “Aquaclean WC oasis.”
This is how the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitation company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival, is called: The need facility in the parterre of a new pavilion gives a lot of effort to streamline a luxurious atmosphere.
On this evening, however, it is in the Lord’s Oasis for any reason to go to heaven.
So out here, on the other side of the street: Invited guests in the cinema next to the opening film “Green Book” just at the best level, celebrate as every year the festival beginning with a party in the three-story department store.
That name fits perfectly with this film festival: The works shown are known from all over the globe.
What does an article about this festival need to not fall into all of this so as not to fall into bad luck for its 190 partner companies?
The falter binds a bundle around the felters, who have put a good fee on him, and two bully doorsters actually suck him in.
In the middle of the night, the invited ones are forced to dance to live music or can be told by DJ rhythms to which they cry each other, and wash down with Cüpli exquisite heaps.
In the delicate dining store in the Souterrain, austers wait for slugging mouths, in addition to being freshly cut up by the incomparable raw shin Culateello di Zibello, a chocolate fountain is sprinkled.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelfs of full exclusive products have not been issued for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The falter studies the shield at the roll stairway: “Wear a long dress, please be careful on the roll stairway.”
If these are two separate instructions, he's gone in the dress code.
But it is more a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved life.
In the household goods department in the upper floor, the poultry claps a cocktail prepared with espresso called “Golden Eye” appropriate to the festival award.
The price of the best drink is not mandatory for this mix with which a capsule manufacturer presents himself.
And George Clooney, who has been working for the brand for years, is not here in the evening either.
However, between local prominence, cash table and kitchen items, a face draws over that is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
There's no way his main performer would be far away.
And really: Similarly, Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty almost acting like a chorknabe, walks through the crowd.
It is not watered, it is not equipped, it is most stolen.
Especially for these restraints, like to misunderstand as clumsiness, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Trainer and ex-football star Diego Maradona is pleased with the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2:0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia-Rythmen, as can be seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow-colored jersey, fired by the players.
The Mexican second-ligist had defeated the Leons Negros with 2:0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called on a TV camera, \"Immer with my boys, always.\"
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send to Last-Minute-Pleite - destroyed at the ground
Sween Bieletzki, coach of the Handball Association Ligist ASV Send, could hardly hold it: “So bitter a defeat — His guardians were destroyed on the ground — after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) — the fourth in the fourth game — on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had not played badly over the wide phases, the transmitters, as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst.
Only the initial phase — we had to sleep completely — angered the ASV trainer.
At first, the housekeepers at 8:1, even the early time that Bieletzki had taken, did not bear fruit.
“But then, suddenly, a ruck went through the team - Bieletzki took second quarter-hours together.
For the rest of the stay, there were only two goals.
Above all, Send's best, Marius Hintze, met another time in the phase.
After the change, it became even better from a visitor point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst was equal to 15:15, after which the staff switcher carried on almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead still seemed to be resting three hits (29:26).
And then?
Involve the impartial in the event.
Bieletzki usually avoids looking for the blame on others.
But: The 120-second-time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff was cashing was a joke.
LIT had a good laugh and met up to the end four more times - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys had great irons, also stood well behind seven men and repeatedly threw them onto the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for compliments.
“Now there must be a damn victory,” said Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: woman missing for 30 years - police dig after body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila, the police were looking for the woman's remains.
On Saturday, the local authorities seized a street near Marxgrüne.
To this end, the road bill and several layers were removed below, as police and prosecutors shared together.
According to new findings, the missing may not have been buried far away from their then residence.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
The investigators also did not exclude a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working together with the prosecutor’s office to re-enforce the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Memorial Protection Authority, the investigators, by means of a ground radar, are on a standstill under the road at Marx Große.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the site to a few meters.
The results of the burials should be announced throughout the afternoon.
The hacker attacks on millions of Facebook users show what dangers are on the network.
However, users themselves can also ensure additional security.
Instead of complicated letter tracking, users should prefer to use passports to secure their accounts on the network.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should soon be installed, nor does it damage to equip computers with an anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening appointment as chief of the billionaire company.
He and the U.S. Stock Exchange Supervisor SEC have filed an extrajudicial dispute over misleading Twitter news, in which Musk could have lost permission to run network-listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla each pay $20 million, and for three years Musk gives the chairman’s office, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
He is allowed to remain against the Board of Directors.
In comparison, which had to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla had any wrong conduct.
The SEC had charged the world-famous manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also holds space company SpaceX, is the public face of losing electric car pioneers, who are now rated on the stock exchange with more than $50 billion.
Musk is not a fault.
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter supporters, he might take the company from the stock exchange, paying $420 per share, the funding was secured.
Tesla would be rated at $22 billion in total.
Later, Musk returned: Tesla remains on the stock market.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find an outside chairman, set up two independent board members, and also set up a committee that oversees Musks communication.

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel as chancellor by 2021
After the quarries of the past few weeks, the GroKo faces several survey depths.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD took the SPD over for the first time in the Emnid Suntagstrend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD adds a counter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and it lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the most profound value for the Union on Sunday.
The Greens reach 15%, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
On Sunday, the government parties would receive SPD, CDU and CSU, according to Emnid, only 43 percent of the vote together.
In this way, the major coalition is currently losing the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes, except for Allenbach.
The political parties are generally up to 43 to 45 per cent of the vote (Allenbach: 51 per cent).
In the 2017 federal election, they received a total of 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, in several polls the second strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach voting shares from 12.5 to 17%.
The link is on average 10 percent, FDP 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls, depending on the voting share, have a uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down.
But also the restraint for chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has declined significantly since the 2017 federal election.
At present, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the chancellor’s office, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
Only every second (50%) is currently looking to see the large coalition held until the next regular federal election in three years, 41 percent are for a new election.
Also, in a further survey published on Saturday, significant popularity losses for Merkel were to be recognized.
The Germans also judge whether Merkel should run for the CDU chairman again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are against it.
As a result, 64 percent of Union supporters do not want a candidate, 35 percent.
Hanging out of Aldi: Price Reduced to Love Happiness
Will Aldi go to Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in Tinder's times there are no more romantic knowledge stories - he should talk to Aldi about put meat.
Munich - In times of digital “fast food dating” through Tinder and Co., the supermarket broadcasts as a knowledgeable place for great love almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced put meat, boxer short cutlery at the whelming table or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app is in a position to be less a contact but rather a clever stock exchange.
We told the test: How do women react to talking around the hot bree in the first message for a long time?
Here is the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood lovestory potential has it then when the love gap precedes an out-of-the-eye-lost and re-founded plot.
If the type is still under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de when it is offered, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus it is the author of this sample in an unknown Aldi branch that she will also find her dreamman, with whom she has briefly been able to enjoy the “30 percent reduced bio-putten meat”.
For the belief in the magic of analog learning, she has definitely earned her Happy End à la Hollywood.

Football: Reus and Zorc ask for rest for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have requested an end to public discussion on the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
“We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that doesn’t do us well,” said the Götze-friended giant after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen at the TV station Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
This is not a simple situation for him personally.

Football: Bezirksliga: Researcher appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, and Alois Fetsch went to court with the Hiss hard.
He gave himself, the coach of the football districtist VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (inner) to sense the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
Everything's History.
In the meantime, it runs around the Brandhoveweg again.
Tauföhrer Beleg is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in which the last time of play was only past dawn on the rise.
Yes, I am very pleased with the performance.
“We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen — he praised Fetsch's boys and looked up every single one for the party to simply say \"thank you\" for so much opposition to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system conversion after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him, Luca Rehberg - it passed almost seamlessly from the 4-4-2 into a 4-2-3-1 where Niklas Thewes was waiting in front of balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more games in the first section.
And chances.
But Frrichs before his aus (17th), the alternate Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the leadership.
Almost that would have smelled as the SCA in minute 41 struck up twice in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be master of his craft.
After the break, the VfL virtually took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed.
Schroer also came late after 58 minutes at a Thewes re-enter.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch of the left side missed again a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrhein Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect release for the placekeepers 18 meters before the guest house.
The Foult was self-inflicted and demonstrated its danger at standards.
Westhues - Thing with the right loop hit the bottom left from the side of the gunner - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes to get fucking long.
And then, in the 80th minute, VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty room unhappyly at hand.
Judge Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not escape the gift (79).
Bange minutes had to survive Wolbeck in the final phase, before Geske had the winning hit on the push in the 87th minute from 12 metres.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frrichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4:1 against Hanover 96
Starting point: Four points after five days of play - this could not be enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure the first home win against Hannover 96.
Stürmer Ante Rebic, who was in the start-elf for the first time after an injury, should help.
Also, midfielder Luca Torró was back in the area after a fungal injury and should with his headball strength prevent the SGE from cashing further goals according to standards.

Allbright Foundation Report: Women remain rare in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female on the date of September 1, as the report “The Power of Monoculture” officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and presented the German Press Agency in advance.
“The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will have to move past them,” said Foundation business leader Wiebke Ankersen.
In the U.S., UK or Sweden, purely male-occupied leadership teams - with few exceptions - are long no longer imaginable.
The resistance made the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented compared.
It is another corporate culture.
The small increase in women’s share among the German stock companies is also due solely to positive impulses in the companies of the index of medium-sized values (MDAX).
Although, according to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - over the past few years previous drivers - the women's share has stagnated.
At last, 26 women worked in the board.
“I’m sure that the Dax companies will re-arrange consistent women in the coming year, in their own interest,” Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that they would not continue to take a self-enforcement to increase the share of zero percent so far.
Another picture comes from the Supervisory Boards: On September 1, the female share was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
“Recruited as many women to the board each year would reach a 40 percent share in 2023,” the report said.
Some even make mixes: luxury cars: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Best of all, Ferrari deserves it.
The Italians use each Ferrari €280,000 sold and make 69,000 euros of business profit.
Large cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Those who make the most profit per car among the noble providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much does the luxury manufacturers cash per car they sell?
This question has been addressed by Autopapst and Economic Professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari made 69,000 euros of business profit with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only reaches around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put a lot of effort on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are good at racing with prices ranging from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in advance of interest rates and taxes EBIT.

In the already well-opened festival, the chairman of the Foreign Transport Association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and Weinprinzess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. “60 years of this kind of alignment - this is an insanity for a small place with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of this - thanks to Starz all the helpers.
Weinprinzess Lisa II later symbolically joined the guests from the stage.
\"Beautiful that so many have found the way to us after abswind - later, \"The Troglausers\" provided mood.
On Sunday, on which the abswinder church was also celebrated, the association on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon had marked the drinking prices as 60 years ago.
A feast to the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before going to the second round a day later in the feast.
In Bonn: Notarztauto power in Taxi
A notary car is heavily damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passenger has been fatally injured.
If emergency doctors are called, they should help - save lives at best.
Such a rescue journey took a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of a notary car with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency physician and their drivers were severely injured, as the police reported.
On Saturday afternoon, the 46-year-old driver of the Notarzt car had crossed a red amphitheater with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then joined the taxi at a crossroads, which was on green.
After the collision, the doctor car slammed against an ampel mast and a tree.
He recorded the passenger who died at the accident site.
Drivers of the notary car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the Notarztwagen were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from power.
The also severely injured 29-year-old emergency doctor was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another revocationed notary tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
Police are in close agreement with Bonn’s prosecutors, who bear the blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we're uncomfortable
After the blamable Aus in the League Cup, Manchester United is now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is under 1:3. The way of defeat may still be to speak.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute, in which the resurgence Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into play.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all of Manchester's defense players stood, and granted Arnautovic all the time in the world to hand over the ball to helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of a previously inadequate performance over a wide range.
It’s very different to the United’s city rival Manchester City.
Mourinho’s major competitors Pep Guardiola trained against Brighton & Hove Albion came to an approximate 2:0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke for the home team for the first time the bar of the outsider.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former goal protection, provided the sixth win in the seventh game, and thus also for jump to the table tip.
Liverpool no longer tableleader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
As with the Cup out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The score of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the game's only hit.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, barely missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it in the 89th minute with his slenzer.
After the Reds were launched with a simple balance sheet in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the Remis in the League, the Blues Liverpool are still falling from the table top.
As City also celebrated the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (on Watford) 2:0 wins.
The Gunners fans, at which Granit Xhaka played, had to wait for a success message until 81th minute against the Hertfordshire county team.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart buked a rendition of Alex I, unluckily into his own goal, just two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season hit.
Arsenal, thanks to the fifth victory in succession to Watford, moved back to the 5th rank immediately behind the great rival Tottenham, continues to have a strong impression on the climber Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten at 2:0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time and finished 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Paris car salon in the sign of diesel battery
The Paris car salon takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no subject and yet everywhere: The diesel scandal and ringing for driving bans and retrofits should not be released by the German auto group at the Paris industry meeting.
At the 2018 Car Salon, they show their novelties from next week along with competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel is no longer playing a major role.
The possible exchange and refund offerings for diesel owners in Germany, which are yet to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, are yet to be an important issue at least behind the bright scenes of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: Although the Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, it is not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electric models: the e-tron of Ingolstadters will be on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgarter 2019.
Officially, both have already been presented.
The iNext of BMW will start in 2021.
At the center of Paris is the new 3rd.
A total of more than 250 delegations are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcyclists and numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a million visitors arrived.
In the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people were killed on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was rocked by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and traffic connections are damaged, and enormous damage is caused.
After the quake, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered at the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims is still going up clearly.
So far, the numbers have only come from Palu.
However, there are also numerous other municipalities affected - along Sulawesis West Coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorrad-Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the completion service for motorcyclists in the Church of Peace in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the church of Peace in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
At the same time, the final Goddess service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the soul-carrying interests of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at the Nordhelle House on the last Sunday of a month.
The closing of the season celebrates the bikes traditionally in the Church of Peace in Eveking.
There, on Sunday, about 150 bikers came together to perform anything but ordinary worship.
From 10 am, the borids were raised before the church's entrance portal.
At first, the biker breakfast was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a delicious curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team were the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach.
The sermon was held during the Biker Goddess service by parishor Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill took care of the musical underpainting.
“Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill prefers poetically peaceful sounds,” said Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novum in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimverein celebrates great celebration: After the apple comes the milk
And also on the actual day of action, Borish was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pan cake.
He was also interested in Georg Hartmann-Niemerg.
He had his apple press in the luggage and demonstrated his amazing spectators step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice.
Then, and when, Hartmann-Nemerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples in the great breeders.
With a little muscle strength, a finely crushed mass was removed from the apples.
Not many of the children were able to imagine how a tasteful drink would be.
However, this important work step could also be seen on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg collected the a little bit like an apple piece looking over one another for layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of work was no longer so difficult.
The newly pressed juice ran continuously into a large vessel.
But the farmer had already completed the specialties.
He opened his treasure chest and presented the latest spring white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop — made in Füchtorf — was accordingly great.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into the conversation, while the children were not only able to track the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up Hüpfburg for themselves.
Also active by the Füchtorfern Cameraship of former soldiers were engaged in as part of the party and invited to short-term games at some stations.
In the coming year, the Home Association will also offer an action day.
Then, as Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home in the heart of the Spargel village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the theme on hand: finally, it will go around the milk.
1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season plea: “Bessiege Situation“
After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disillusioned professionals from Hannover 96 to join and speak up.
There was a lot of positive things to see at 1:4 (0:2) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt.
“It’s a terrible situation, but you have to get out of it as a team,” said 96-foot professional Pirmin Schweiger and SHOB: “This is of course disappointing, because you’re always taking a lot of action.”
The further victorious Lower Saxonys, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) came to a close, stand with two counters at all and are a candidate for departure in their current constitution.
In contrast, led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first season home win.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful general sample for the European League match against Lazio Rome, scored seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was nearly involved in any dangerous offensive action of the Hesses in his debut debut and never to be caught by Hanover's defence.
The storm hit long after the World Cup showed with its pace and endurance why it is so valuable for the entry.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan was also loaned out by FC Liverpool for the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who began to swing.
A headball falsified on the gate network by Lucas Torró (17th) was at first dangerous.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped at the last moment by the 96th defence of the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back) in the short run.
The leadership for the housekeepers fell almost necessarily and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball after a disarmed corner into the penalty room, Haller extended by head in front of the gate, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesligatsrelffer for the defence players that came in the summer by the French second-ligist AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt still lays down before the break.
This time, Haller adapted to his storm partner Rebic, who was able to get through and left 96-Torwart Michael Esser no chance.
In halftime, Hannover coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak notion of his elf and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxonys now played a bit more bravely forward, however, burning ideas remained until shortly before the end, when still the connection hit.
The houses were much more efficient.
After a brief hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed across De Guzmán, who only had to throw the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only shown for the Frankfurters against overriding guests, and Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes the party mile
In spite of cold temperatures, good mood prevailed at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter succeeded millions of audiences at the opening of the 185th century.

Geisingen: Giesinger Christian Celebrates Holy Cross Festival
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14th or Sunday after.
The feast service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross church with the finale.
The Holy Cross Church hosts the shot Christ, who comes from the 30th anniversary of the war and is intended to have shot at the legend after a Swedish soldier.
From the shot wound, blood is removed.
This led to a great journey to the shot Christ, which also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
It is not finished until today, only the altar is standing, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, parish priest Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
In spite of the importance of the Giesinger parish, the church was badly visited.
After the service of God, the procession took place to the Holy Cross Church, and with the end of the church, the Church of the Cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic Church choir has been inviting to the Catholic parish home for the worldly part of the feast.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty meals as well as a wide selection of cakes and the weather adapted, farm ice.
In the afternoon, the parish community still offered tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger, on behalf of the parish community, to inform visitors about the damage to façade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue until the next year.
After some time, damage could be determined more accurately and the individual requests prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but it has also been more determined, which has only been possible by means of the draw-in appearance by means of equipment.
The work is completed, and before winter, the natural stone works are still to be started, and it is hoped that half of these works will be completed this year.
Invitation: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Life Help Danube-Iller opens a new residence for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that in the Münsterblickstraße now — a very special house — is passed on to its destination — was agreed upon by all the present at the inauguration date.
Finally, the 12 wheelchair drivers who have been living in the home of the Donau-Iller’s life aid for some time are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
In its concept, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider gears, floors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access to all areas.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army officer building was put to the test stand for cell phone cap residents: “The house came in the years and no longer timed in the equipment,” Bader said.
In 2016, the baggers stepped down to tear down the house.
The new building should be designed as kindly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, the architect said.
Life Help Donau-Iller Opens New Home
About €4.6 million invested the life aid in the new construction.
The free state raised €2.4 million, the district of Swabia € 450000.
According to architect Bader, the construction work remained in the planned framework - both time and financial.
He also thanked the manager of life aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The gap between a barrier-free and fire-proof construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and artisans, with the many requirements, had built a home that allowed residents to experience freedom even without foreign help.
Similarly, the head of the Social Administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: “The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents, the resources needed to be mobile.
The housing and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: “The property in this situation is a real happiness case because it is no longer available in today’s situation.”
Overall, the new residence in Münsterblickstraße offers almost 1500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three residential groups.
Stolz is the life aid manager Heinz on the eleven full-time forces all employed by tariffs.
Germany: Heavyly accuses differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the deputy SPD government chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all citizens not to find out about the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that pain unit after almost 30 years.
With these differences, we must not be satisfied - the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern said the \"day mirror on Sunday -
The goal must be to create the same living conditions across the country.
It is unacceptable for East Germans to work longer than the people in West Germany, but get 15 percent less pay.
“I can’t explain that to anyone almost 30 years after the German unity,” said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this puddle dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan-Jagdhund is to smooth the waves between the two Koreans.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang made the South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two of them reached their recipients about a year old dogs already on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to facilitate the animals’ “accommodation”
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship had announced the North at the third summit meeting this year between Moon and North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to join in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply for the award of the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket drives.
Austria’s moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this memorial year for nearly ten months, numerous new books have been published that answer this question mostly in the back of the past hundred years.
In completely different ways, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, is quoted in the magnificent \"Picture Book\" of Austria, which will appear on October 1.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to business work - this is the unofficial motto for the current working week of the Great Coalition.
Almost an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and their ministers from CDU, SPD, and also from the CSU have recently made mantra-like accusations about the ‘return to business work’.
This may have led so many artisans, physicians, cashiers and other interested citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and business work, but be this.
If the federal government is now in a position to re-acquire their commission - the government - then it should not be held by terms of debate.
Whether the Union and SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and blasts of the last few weeks will likely be shown Monday.
In the evening, the tops of the government parties meet with the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round on a regular basis to defuse conflicts early; a teaching from all the dispute.
First, however, there are conflicting issues on the agenda with the Diesel Renewals and the Expert Immigration Act.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to make the car companies with exchange premiums glamour away, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to upgrade older diesel.
While an approach has been made over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned specialist immigration law.
The SPD calls for a staying perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or make an education.
The Union is strictly opposed to the ‘track change’ from the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will be a dispute again among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not the same and the same has become GroKo, but three partners with some very different social images and priorities.
The dispute is good.
Without a dispute, a society drawn by so many, including conflicting interests is not progressing.
In order to be constructive, however, dispute must not be built up again for party-tactic reasons on the question of being or non-being.
It's still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD should argue - but always have the reality of people's lives at hand.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this guiding question, it is possible to explain both the diesel and the trace exchange question pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Especially for this, the people’s parties must fight now.
Smell reviewed working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the Vision
Does the Minister of Labour violate the applicable right of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to look at it more closely.
\"Really day and night, their legists had been working on social insurance reform, a top-notch social minister reported on the presentation of themselves two weeks ago.
In the case of list-pilz mandate Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is surprising - she now brings the matter to Parliament via request.
They assume that “the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the use of her team and, in no event, to announce violations of the applicable right of service in front of current cameras.”
Despite this, she now has questions to be able to free Har thinker - from any suspicion -
Police are searching for women’s body a road
Marx Green - For a long time, the police didn't want to express themselves.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, Naila and Bad Steben have been excavated on the state road.
The route is still closed in the Marx Green area until Monday.
It was predicted that the investigators had previously used an archeology dog.
The dog trained specifically for the smell of old human bones, along with its leader in multiple use, was finally able to limit the relevant spot to a few meters.
In addition, along with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian memorial protection authority in the field of the said street piece, a ground anomaly was discovered.
For more than a year, the prosecution and criminal police court have been working on the missing case.
A cycle was repeatedly blocked at Marxgrünt and investigated with sonar devices because the investigators suspect that Heike’s body might have been damaged here in the course of the new building of the state road 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum will be held in Catalonia for the first time.
But it has already come to Krawallen.
The separatists did not forget the police deployment of the fall of 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and police occurred in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by independence advocates, among other things, with color powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
About 3000 police officers from the Polishía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honor their colleagues who were in use last year in the election venues as an illegal referendum.
When trying to prevent citizens from voting, it also came to violence at the time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the separatist and central-state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the approximately 6000 separatists, however, had tried to break through the police chain with force, and the officials, among other things, had to deal with color bags and eggs.
Six persons have been arrested, 24 more have been easily injured, according to the authorities.
On Monday, the independence referendum will be held for the first time.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the Central Government of Madrid made Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians were also moving abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement continue to sit in U-Haft.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the entry into office of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra is based on the “right to self-determination” of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected advice: FC Gütsloh and RW Ahlen separate torlos
Red-White Ahlen continues to appear on the scene.
Also with FC Goodsloh, it was only enough to have 0:0 undisputed.
The final light and the third were detonated in front of 438 spectators at Heidewald Stadium as assembled advicelessness.
The first half was easily overlooked by the entertainment factor arg.
Anyone who prefers to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so unscathed.
There was no danger of missing a torch because there was virtually no one.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) goal of the entire party, Gütslohs Nick Flock signed in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle only real - option the Ahleners had, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty room limit.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged for injury, for which he came in Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decide to do something against the increasingly rising boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters reached just above the housing and after one hour, the goods loher also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a Ball Conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz, it went fixed.
The soon-presented account about Sinan Aygün-krönte- Nick Flock (62nd) with a lick shot into the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, with a headball of Wieckowicz (66th), they laid down after a corner ball by ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Anes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahleners did not allow it.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it also didn’t bring anything.
Angelo Daut tried to strike out the positive: “I like that we played zero, but unfortunately the zero stood ahead too.
“This time we were not as torrid as we were against woodwicked ones and that although our opponent had no desire to play here, RW Ahlen’s interim coach said.
Offensive, everything was a bit like that, against a team that only wanted to defend.
At least I didn’t feel like we could get a counterpart — so it was.
As a spectator, however, you didn’t feel as if your team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too expensive for that.
Reaching fields Harvest Thanks market: Luckily there are enough Kreimers
The Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler are pleased by the range field table output point for which these donations are intended.
The Honorary Insurance: “These donations remain in the reach field, too.
At the opening, the sky appeared bright blue, the square on the other hand something still empty, but that should change over the course of the day.
Because, “It’s so nice here, so we’re here today,” said a visitor.
The organizer of the feast Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent Priese Humor.
For the couple of Brockmann, who should actually be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer sprang up in the short term.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) became ill.
There are plenty of creimers.
And the “substitution” could not be taken in between the music that is becoming more and more visitors.
This was so well done that at a later hour some folk songs were sung.
“Simply great, Marcel Kreimer was pleased.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his appointment plan.
He is pleased with the many activities with their standings, including mostly associations.
\"In fact, there should not be such a thing as a table at all - he thanked himself for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in service at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the “Clean Up” action.
Our garden town has a colorful touch - here's what's going on.
Then the Maikranz was taken by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the firefighter and brought to the winter quarter.
Many stands have been worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to heartful was everything to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who had lived in Reckenfeld for only a year, was created on his decupiers’ days.
Furniture work, beer cover with rackfield motifs and a lot more he had in offer.
A speciality offered three receding fields of Imker: \"Reckfields Honey\" brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wettershoven and Helen Roth-Bushschlüter.
Finally, there is a speciality in this.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, so well tasted the cake.
The event is that the visitors then stayed long to the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrication with local political message: No successful advertising for skate plant
In Lengerich, unknowns have been in a very rare way for the construction of a skate plant.
In several places there are corresponding lubrications, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal action has been taken against the police for injury.
In large letters, the three words “Skatepark für Lengerich” are pronounced on signs including the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Hall, reports that after the professional election on 19 September, a corresponding letter had been found on the advertising shield on the rise to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the brief message of his time had apparently been left “only” with an edding, they could easily be removed.
“But a few days later, it was back there, this time spraying up,” Rottmann said.
He assumes that the appropriate advertising shield must be replaced.
A special note is given just in that on the table several large companies are also named from Lengerich.
If the skate installation is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
Jörg Hesselmann, from the urban area of school, sports and culture, explains it already without a name.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the embroiled table.
For years local policy and administration have been involved in the subject of skate installation.
After the old was demolished at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The Council finally voted mostly for the firefighter parking lot.
However, this view was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this site.
At the end of June, a turning point followed.
Members of the Main and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the Area of Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says to the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is the city council.
He made a decision this year, so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Air safety is getting worse
After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, the German pilots do not see any signs of improvement in the coming year.
“This year we had wind, 2019 we’ll have strong winds and then the storm comes,” said the chief of the airline’s trade union, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the airline summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known need for European flight insurance, for which there is no quick solution.
“ Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new lots lasts four to five years,” the trade unioner said.
The European market for fully trained lotteries has been abandoned.
Only in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace were around a hundred people missing.
Maas again criticized the fact that various air traffic unions were not invited to the summit.
In Hansestadt, on Friday, representatives of the Federal, the countries, flight insurance, airlines and airports will meet together to address the causes of delays.
“If you want to talk about additional work sealing and overtime, it won’t go without us,” said the head of the GdF, who has many members at the federal German air insurance.
Maas was once again responsible for EU commission requirements for the Lotsen Misere.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been far too low.
The cost regulations derived from this and staff savings for national flight insurance are now full of operations.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to take action in Brussels for regulations that do not allow the air to slow down further.
At present, EU regulations would be in place by 2024 and there would be further reinforcements to fear.
The EU is constantly exposed to lobbying on the side of the airlines.
“Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in the last few years,” Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs will lead to a rethinking in the airlines.
The GdF will only be involved in improving the situation if the German air insurance company (DFS) offers a “skilled training and future package,” Maas said.
The recorded record of 120 lotteries annually over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related procedures.
The necessary building of staff is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board agrees for Group conversion
Members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans to rebuild the group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors at the meeting on Sunday, the crippling group is to be split into two independent societies.
Both companies should have their headquarters in food and be listed on the stock market.
There should be no additional reduction in staff beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
There are ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is to make a main meeting expected in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industries AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demos by police officers and Catalan independence advocates.
In the case of two contemporary demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent disputes with numerous injured people.
According to the city administration, on Saturday about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain, as well as some 6,000 independent advocates demonstrated themselves.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a big bid.
However, according to the use forces, independent advocates repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They attacked the officials with color and throw shots.
According to the report, there were also between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
Police told me there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police wanted to honor the colleagues with their demonstration, who had been against the Spanish Central Government’s banning independence referendum in Catalonia almost a year ago.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unjust that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve far more than they do.
The protesters felt it was provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
“Why did they come to protest here?” asked 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez from AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they destroyed us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balears, who only wanted to indicate his name with Daniel, turned back the charge.
“Of course, we want to support our comrades who have only done their duty last year: defend the law,” he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because this is a big European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues, however, did not, to provoke, assure the policeman.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A security gap with a mobile app has led to the temporary access of personal data from ministers and members of the Conservative British Tory Party on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the Panne became known a day before the Tory Party Day in Birmingham.

Football: Juve coach praises after top party: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese star stormer played the best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia, Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive purchased star was also without its own gate the crucial man in the important match against the pursuer.
“Ronaldo had a lot of fun and did it well,” Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo’s three goal templates, Juve turned the game after the early resistance through the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung off the terrified pursuer first.
The real Madrid goalkeeper first laid out the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who led with a double pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo, after a corner by headball, also made the prework for the hit of defence chief Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who had only to move in just before the goal line.
\"He gives a lot of templates - he praised the coach.
But Allegri, of course, also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of record goalkeepers.
“We need to get better at serving him,” the coach demanded.
Best Juve Tor protection is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With Ronaldo's purchase for more than 100 million euros, the power of Juventus seems even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the simple series in the series A. At 21 points, the master of the back seven years already has six counters lead on Naples.
The table second trained by the former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti was not likely against Turin.
But, at the latest, after the reference of the already-warned Mario Rui (58th), the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to face Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the square after too hard entry.
“We played well against a good Naples,” the Turin Coach commented.
It was also possible to feel Emre Can.
The German national player has gone through Juve.
The professional who came from FC Liverpool was in use with all seven league parties.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, allegri with the “half-hour” meaning that Ronaldo was flying off the pitch at the 2:0 victory of the Turiners and was locked off for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes its name
With a particularly scurrileous appearance, Rapper Kanye West took care of attention at the U.S. TV show “Saturday Night Live” on weekends.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided end-runs and question marks for viewers.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change to the release of his new album.
It is only possible to call him “Ye,” according to the musician.
“The creature, formerly known as Kanye West, tweeted in response to the deceased singer Prince when he gave his artist’s name.
The pseudonym, however, is not new.
The 10th album has already been released under that name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that “Ye” has a religious significance for him.
“I believe ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means ‘you’,’ so the rapper.
\"Kissliga A1 Münster: Endlich\".
Created!
Houtmar's coach Averhage made no helm out of his disappointment.
That was a weak game for us today.
The opponent was simply more gripped, we've been to him as well as never before -- correspondingly thinly read the list of hatmarers' options.
Grade two torchancens in 90 minutes, so you can only rarely make games positive.
Football Circle A1: SC Hoetmar is under SG Sendhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first passage, the first but used Maik Krause from a pointed angle to the early guide (7th).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen would have been able to raise Uphus, but after great pre-work by Krause, he relented freely.
The hosts had only a double chance when, first of all, Mortz Höne to Torsteher Jo's shoemaker failed and in the aftermath Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all gave.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved by hand on the gateline and saw red for it - neither was Niklas Eilmann able to use for the guests (75th).
Only when Nils Berheide pushed the ball over the line was the match decided (81).
“We had been harshly criticized before, which was different today than in the last few weeks — was the essence of Florian Kraus.
Sendhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectake football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is under Concordia with 3:4
“I don’t know what I should like about it,” he said.
\"We don't have access to them at all - he probably meant the wing tongs with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably all the other green-whites that come up with collective offensive urge.
Nevertheless, he could laugh: “A terrible victory,” he said, twinkled out and pulled from his players, on the other hand, the relief was noticed that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Well noted, according to a duel of two teams, one of whom, namely abbots, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the class.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
“This was our best season performance,” he says.
“How we come back after 0:2 as we stand against one of the league’s top teams throughout the gametime, that was truly phenomenal.
The more bitter it became that you had to drive home with empty hands.
Top goalkeeper Lars Zymner led the host with his 12th season hit.
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2:0 was placed on the left side of the pattern valid for Fabian Frörning (39).
We knew this, but such a player cannot be completely removed.
“That was mad at what he had done,” Lewandowski acknowledged the enemy’s quality.
Shortly before the change of pages, his own elf made the compensation: McGill's release from left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhütter Hinkerohe into the long draw (45th).
After the change of pages, it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (59).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a nice, action-laden game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann resembled him (69th).
In spite of overcrowding, Albersloh was no longer able to account for the last Concordia hitter (80th).
We must now focus our full focus on Wednesday.
“The game against sheep, that’s what we need to win now,” Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Gates: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Early (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74th/Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fights point against Primus
There was no winner in the National League Duell between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The table guide was actually on for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: Total Bureau of Dynamo Dresden resigns
The entire Bureau of Football-Twilightist Dynamo Dresden has resigned according to media reports.
Several media called on the evening in agreement with a joint letter from the Sachsen’s body.
At first there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal is to be internal power struggles with the former Bundesligist.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
It's good that he's gone again.

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing offers around 80 meetings by mid-to-late next year.
At the same time, France’s President-in-Office, Emmanuel Macron, has signaled that he wants to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term was too short: as the Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
Thus, academic director Udo Hahn acknowledged when he proudly said: “All federal presidents and federal chancellors were already with us - that the presence of prominence at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was always a matter of the year, but was also a subject of the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer Konstantin Wecker participates in a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, and on 29 September, writer Frido Mann is at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France’s President-in-Office Emmanuel Macron also pledged that he would personally accept the “Tolerance Prize” awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also received television host Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The around 80 meetings by mid-2019 have been in place.

From structural racism in society to the shear between the poor and the rich to radical change in work by digitization, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academy Director Hahn said: “A free democracy needs places where a citizen society can come together to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions.

Karl Marx's birthday is the first to expect a more visitor to the direction of capitalism, the other more likely to have a tendency from the left to the middle.

Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
“Both for adults and men, the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner was in the Hall of Christ Church in Wolbeck on Friday evening.
As a cabaret tester, Teubner set out to understand the gender, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (feeling) woman and the man and what else there might be, but also with music.
The mini guitar set her up and also ordered her violin.
On the wing Ben Süverkrupp sat.
On the one hand, he is one of the male sparing partners, who comes to the end of the sentence, on the other hand, a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanied Suverkrupp Teubner, that some might wish for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but otherwise, as it was the red thread of the evening.
There, Teubner had a paradox in the game: the satisfaction with the man comes when he has a partner, but he does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefits.
The piano solo now demonstrates self-biges: What would emerge from the composer Mozart's, would 'the Nannerl' have opened the door unhappily?
So Süverkrupp slips over in improvisations, from Bach’s “O Main Full of Blood and Wounds” into the “Silence of Death” and Mozart G-Moll Symphony into a playful dance.
There were big applause and \"Bravo\" from the full hall.
Flowers supplied Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the Chansonette.
But President Heidemarie Brandenbeck could not be thanked.
She had the idea to give the duo, in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt, also one in Wolbeck.

Handball: Women's Landsliga: Ahlener SG retains against TV Wattsscheid barely the white west
The Ahleners had problems, especially with third-party player Caroline Stallmann, who only marked ten hits.
“In fact, I was well pleased with the defence, only one player has made too many goals.
We haven’t got that in hand, as ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu said.
But he was angry more about the many opportunities left out.
The concentration at the end of the day left his team missing this time.
Therefore, the ASG ran almost to the end of a setback, was behind at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45).
It was not until the end that the wider bank of the hosts became crucially noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu Backroom Merle Klement placed on the left side, which then “extremely clevered the crucial gates” (Aydogdu).

The first passage dominated the guests almost as much as they wanted.
4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the champions of the previous year with 25:15.
Food has been accepted in the two line, but has not come into play.
We've got a good job with them.
Our opponent has put up high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led with 12:8. “Essen changed the acceptance to three lines.
We couldn't keep the storage pressure.
Food has been ranked, and we've got a bit of a get-together - so Munch goes on.

Although, at 19:24, East Bevern resisted four sets of balls, the fifth attempt took place.

International: Turkish municipality: Mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which the large ditib mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
“The mosque opening in Cologne has left behind in the German-Turkish relationship a sharp hip that can only be difficult to come together,” said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides had missed the opportunity for a common, consensual appearance.
“Stat side by side with German top politicians to emphasize the belonging of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the appointment for his purposes,” Sofuoglu complained.
The German public’s vast exclusion has “strengthened many reservations”

Almost on the day exactly it is then a year ago that we have performed a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become a strong part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln, pleased Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimverein.
The fact that our people’s meeting was so fast in Nottuln eta, I wouldn’t have thought.
Whether Sturmtief Friederike in January or Hitzewelle in July, the fireplace room of the official was always fully occupied.
“The programme at the next People’s Meeting is like always a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and seaman songs, folk songs, evergreens and old drummers,” says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who regularly invites friends to Nottuln.

From pure fruit production to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammerger-Halle, the 125-year-old existence of the Circuit Association for Garden Construction and Land Care was celebrated.
On 29 September 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbach Association House, the last movement was set up for the Kulmbach Circuit Association for Garden Construction and Landesbezirk Kulmbach, and just 125 years later he celebrated a large anniversary in the Kulmbach City Hall on Saturday evening.
At that time, he was still another name: As a \"Czechobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land\" he was removed from baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
Also, the purpose of the fruit-building association is different from today's work - it was actually just about the fruit-building process, about flowers and gardening, no one thought about it.
“At that time, during the era of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites,” said circuit home care worker Günter Dippold in his speech.
Fruit trees should slum away roads, so-called industrial gardens were built at schools.
The fruit cultivation is still the task of 55 gardening clubs in the district of Kulmbach, which includes almost 7000 members.
However, the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A natural gardening, biological plant protection, village beauty and diet play a role as much as imparting knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
As many of the tasks of a garden building club are, the members of the Hutschdorf Youth Group “Maulwurfe” showed entertainment at the stage.
“Young people’s work is particularly urgent in the digital age,” said Günter Reif, the circuit chairman, and OB Henry Schramm, stressing how important experiences are in nature for life.
The castanian collection was a huge thing for us children, I doubt you can collect a lot of joy with smartphone & co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
\"Where they should stand, the county association decides - complemented Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of gardening associations for the villages.
The county association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
That this is a real concern of the many horticultural clubs in the county, it also left no doubt about county manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with a picture presentation through the long history of the county association and, among other things, reported the need for self-supply after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, and for the winter it was dosed in.
At the end of the 50s, however, the utility garden turned into a veritable and residential garden.
“Nature has stock, it has been there before us and we have to focus on it,” asked the expert for fruit and nuts trees.
That’s why there’s no incentive for gardening clubs to leave so that our home will remain beautiful and worth living.
It is also part of welcoming the new citizens into our associations, the President of the Bavarian National Association, Europcar Vaitl added.
\"We must stop the eclatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren - Günter Reif closed the successful feast, which was solemnly framed by the turbulences of the Thurnau Music Association.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister Moves UN Red
Mexico’s government wants clarity in Nafta: they provide both trading partners with an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada’s foreign minister is now taking an absolute priority to the Trade Agreement, and is shifting her speech from the United Nations.
Due to the pressure of time in ringing a new issue of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech during the UN General debate in New York.
Instead of on Saturday, the Minister will not speak until Monday before the full meeting of the United Nations, her spokesperson Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, they focus on Nafta’s renegotiation.
The Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo had stated on Friday that Canada’s negotiators and the United States had 48 hours of time to end if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already made between its country and the United States.
In August, the US and Mexico agreed on a resumption of the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been running for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be concluded, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the U.S. Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of negotiations, Mexico’s designer president Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report from the daily newspaper O Globo.
After his resignation, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician had been attacked on open street in southern Brazil during an election campaign in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title \"Ele não\" (in German: \"He Not\"), women's associations had mainly called for protests against the ex-Military.
In the social networks too, the associations against Bolsonaro's racist and women's contemptive statements made mobile.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the São Paulo economy.
In the capital city of Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a proclamation of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He joined ex-president Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and therefore was not allowed to run.
The Presidential election in Brazil is October 7.
As an ex-citizen champion of the million city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been behind the far right-wing candidate Bolsonaro.
The “Trump Brazil” has long been involved in political activity, but now presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be a tight election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not succeed from this, no matter who he enters.
Bolsonaro is known for hating homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He is constantly shocked with verbal disappointments.
Another time he said the supporters of Lulas left-wing workers' party should be shot.
Europe Gets Ryder Cup Title Back
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour away from Disneyland, the European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale before the gates of Paris.
Captain Thomas Björn’s outside team has droned more than 150,000 spectators on the three days in the Le Golf National with great beats and outstanding team spirit to the favorite title-defunct USA for a toothless Tiger Woods.
After a long illness, Danish rock legends died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
At the deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and his six children.
The musician has been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen became familiar with the band Gasolin', which in the 70s was extremely successful in Scandinavia.
Their songs were influenced by international musical sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the release of the band in 1978 Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His album “Midt om natten” from 1983 is the most-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen honored Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a \"street boy\" who was \"at all but in all hearts\"
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen appeared in 2010 on the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at press air hammer level
“Here we stand, take the bone saws and lighten a concert evening with the strength of a tiger — the band name of ‘Here We Stand’ — ‘Tiger Bonesaw’ and ‘The Ignition’ — lay such a description of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the Hall of the Civil Center shoe factory: Harsh pure of three with another befriended band.
After the sound check and just before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency Mosquito - from Oelde - with their bands, the about 120 visitors of the Mint Mosquito Rock Night, look forward.
The quartet \"Tiger Bonesaw\" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika also knows how to convince the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from their own spring and the CD that will soon appear.
Before the stage, when the band is performed, it is done for the vocal and printful interplay.
Even if \"Rupe is not to be ignored, \"Tiger Bonesaw - then the trio \"Here We Stand - leave the stage.
The fact that the harp is not the same harp is the same, guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the bass and drummer Kai Holscher demonstrate with their alternative, sometimes reminding of classical rock of the 1970s.
After the 'High Energy Rock' - the 'Tigers' - comes with 'Here We Stand' - in addition to the guitar rock, a synthesizer is also used.
Not only the curious, almost ballasty ‘Take Me Home’ is it because of the change of metallic passages to the guitar-laden rock riffs of multi-layer songs.
The quartet “The Ignition” from Tönnishäusen has since its foundation in 2005 played a special degree of fame.
Fully agility, the band will present their harps on Saturday.
That “The Ignition” with its performances before a large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - has special stage experience is obvious and unsurprising.
In collaboration with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets their own accents in the only covered song of the evening, Word Up, by Cameo from the 80s.
To feel even higher than previously, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a cheering solo while running through the audience.
Of course, a certain volume belongs to genre-related in the name of such Harsh-Concert: The \"Mint Mosquito\" Rocknacht, according to the results of the Mixpult team, is located at the three concert of \"Here We Stand - Tiger Bonesaw - and \"The Ignition\" at about 98 Decibel.
This is, for example, at the pressure-air hammer level, but it is still clearly under the control of the “waking-fessfall” on its website.
Hearings of 120 decibels in nozzle drive volume as usual at the annual Metal-Stelldikhein in the north of the Republic do not require the Ahlener audience at this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the tougher, rocky gangart have long been convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
“Here we stand, we have taken the bone saws and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger - all three groups, freely in the transferred sense, can end up saying.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of visitors.

A dead in sailing plane accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
At Mülheim/Essen Airport, a fatal accident occurred.
On a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport, a sailing plane crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
In the vicinity of Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday, a deadly accident occurred.
As the West German general newspaper reports, a sailing aircraft crashed at the Messeparkplatz at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the “WAZ” further reports, the flight airport has been on board alone - the pilot is intended to be a resident.
At the time of the accident, the plane was already on landing flight.
The crash site is just a few minutes away on the airport ground.
However, an October festival has been held since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the city line of the two Ruhr area cities and directly on the way to Highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park&ride offer at large events at the fair Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump says, “And then we fell in love.”
The fact that U.S. President North Korea's CEO Kim is well-off despite nuclear crisis is not a secret.
However, Trump has now made a regular declaration of love for his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim’s “wonderful letters.”
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has become a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a remote relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half as old as the ruler's dynasty from Pyongjang, although it proved to be quite brute in the rings around North Korea's atomic demolition.
“I was firm, he too, and between us it went on and on,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim had brought his heart to melt.
He wrote me wonderful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip confessions.
That the affection for whether or not his Martial threat-bearers infamous \"Rocket Man - so Trump's nickname for Kim - may not be any memoryr, seems to be very aware of the U.S. president.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of this when he appeared in a large sports hall of the city of Wheeling just ahead: “Donald Trump says they fell in love”
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so unpresided.
But he warmed that little, Trump explained and then directed his show finger to the crowd: “I always told you it’s so easy to be presidential.”
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this pall-filled arena, but we would only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler's best visited, vocal and above all spoiled by Sun sat: Very varied and with a good shot Oktoberfestflair, Baesweiler's downtown has pummeled out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest took place not only in the fortress at the firefighting tower, but was extended from the commercial association to the city on Sunday.
Refugees rescued thanks to video from libyschem prison
Nigerian refugees have referred to their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya with the help of a mobile phone video, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had filmed in their cell in the coastal city of Savija in July and was spreading online.
“They refuse to send us back,” said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the “France 24 Observers” website, whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
“Without the video we could not have returned to Nigeria,” said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he brought himself to life by his own statement.
One of his opponents was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention have been disastrous: “They all hit us with pipes and sticks.”
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary withdrawal of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their home this year with the help of the program, said the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now saved Nigerians is not exceptional with regard to the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
From a call by phone video, he hasn’t heard before.
International organisations have long criticized the conditions in Libyan refugee camps as humane.
The North African state, which is ruled by far more militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the public school place on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a breaker.
At 16:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the front house of the 1st floor, she saw a man who immediately fled.
Only through a door, then through the roof terrace and from there via a stairway into the ground or in front of the ground.
The teacher understood the police who had taken the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot be said.
Treater description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark t-shirt.
Please refer to the Obernberg police inspection at the Inn, phone number 059 133 4244.
German was caught in their own car for days.
A 75-year-old man in a forested area in central France had to stay in his car for several days and nights after driving the car off all the forest roads and blocking a tree from the car door.
Rescue forces accidentally discovered the truck on Saturday afternoon and released the missing one since Tuesday night, police told on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reportedly in good health despite the cold nights and the long period of time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing from his family after he had not returned from a trip with his terrain car on Tuesday through the local ways and fields.
Despite intense search measures, the man’s stay remained unclear for days.
Laschet Announces Rule of Law in Turkey
In an interview with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has mentioned the state of law in Turkey.
The relations of the two countries are currently “overestimated,” Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at the Cologne airport.
This is especially true of arrest waves, press and religious freedom.
He has therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relationships are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
According to her own report, Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans sitting in prison in Turkey.
He has formulated the expectation that freedom of speech will be respected.
Erdogan has again emphasized the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan was soon moved into a building of the Ministry of Defense of the Federal Republic of Cologne.
Originally, it had to take place at the castle of Wahn - but the castle owners had refused to do so out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan went on to open the Ditib Mosque in Cologne after the conversation.
Lashet had denied a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, “The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country.”
And we are also their contact, and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the United States: North Korea is demanding abduction
While U.S. President Trump will not be tired of stressing the success in the negotiations on determinization of North Korea, the East Asian regime represents the conditions more sobering.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for an agreement from Washington.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. Government of blocking negotiations for an nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
“The latest standoff is that the U.S. is building on forced measures that are deadly for building trust,” Ri said in New York.
A demolition is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
“Without any trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we are disarming ourselves as the first one,” the North Korean chief diplomat said.
The fact that criminal measures may force North Korea to \"knee\" is a dream of people who don't know us -
In order to build trust, however, his country has stopped his nuclear and missile testing and destroyed a nuclear testing plant, Hob Ri said.
However, from the U.S. side, there have been no “responsive reactions,” the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council decided three times last year’s sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo pushed at the United Nations for strict compliance with the criminal measures in recent days.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on an approach.
In June, Trump first met North Korea's power owner Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the U.S. President is pursuing a second summit meeting with Kim.
In October, Pompeo was to travel to Pyongyang to discuss the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, of which the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing with: white ceilings and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet waiting for guests after the harvest thanks service.
The young people of HoT were enchanted by the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was funded by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank for the food.
The start with the new facility was not just easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the leader of the HoT, recalls.
We had filled our refrigerators before the summer break with food and ingredients and were best prepared for the big day.
But then, on the first day after the summer break, the evil surprise came: a power failure had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was corrupt and had to be taken care of.
“We had to start again from the front: Although we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the kids and young people wanted to create it on their own,” West Neighbor said.
And that's how everyone packed with it.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
\"Better can't cook either - a visitor praised a visitor while Hokkaido sandwich soup was served or guests were allowed to serve on quiche, liver cheese or cake.
“It’s really great what the kids and young people put on the legs,” said parishioner Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen, with card tricks and other pieces of art, made surprises.
Jürgen Sator leaves the National Board of NRW of the Table
From frustration over criticism from their own ranks, the head of the Essene Table, Jörg Sartor, has resigned his post in the National Association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essene Table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned as Vice Chief of the NRW Tables in July, Sartor said, \"World on Sunday.\"
Too many fell into my back.
The head of the table-land association NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed an understanding of the decision of his longtime deputy.
This sharp criticism brought Sartor with it.
“I can follow his step - there have been people who didn’t know exactly why the food table does that.
However, Sartor is still active for the Essene Table - \"six days a week, as nothing changes\" - so Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized criticism of colleagues from other tables in the world on Sunday.
You can’t follow the approach, without staring at the people in the city.
It is the task of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not participate in a convention of the Tables in Berlin on Friday.
“There’s too much sweetness to tell me,” he said.
There are all these social fuzzies that have been so critical of me at the time.
SF Lorch play 2:0 lead - Gmünder Tagepost
Football, district league Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Hüuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after resistance - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clear.
At 2:0 Lorch was already in charge in the home game against the TV Neuler - at the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
Very different from the TV Hüuchlingen: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly got to meet 0:1, but after 90 minutes with 2:1. At the table peak, the SGB was able to do so with a 3:0.
Gladbach plays two-time lead - Schalke without Embolo with first win
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an outward victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first season win (1:0).
(sda) Four times Schalke has maneuvered himself in the first five league games with early counters to the abseit.
Now the Domenico Tedesco team again put that strength on the day with which it took first place in the last season behind the Bayern.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after strong prework by Yewgeni Konopljanka by head, as a result, the hosts preserved the minipolster with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets new from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had traded against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the 2nd half of the season, the win was a 4:2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) compared with a double within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided another doublette in the final phase (86th working days) for the crowning conclusion of the increase in performance after the break.
The first victory was also the VfB Stuttgart.
Against this because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic already decimated before the break, Werder Bremen had to temporarily fear the Stuttgarters.
Borna Sosa and the unobserved goalie Ron-Robert Zieler manufactured a Kuriosse origin owner, which helped the guests to compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first win.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a complete, happy debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers, joined by Swiss Quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, made a two-time lead, played 2:2 and continued to wait for an out-of-door victory in VW City since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's compensation to 1:1, Renato Steffen was responsible for his second federal leaguer.
In the plane of 20 metres of the Aargauer, Yann was powerless in summer, as well as in the second counteroff after an hour.
However, the trends at Gladbach are very heated.
Alassane Pléa proves to be a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase from the OGC Nice came after for the third time and for the seventh time in the seventh.
After seven rounds, Gladbach finished 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen turned against the VfB Stuttgart in an uncompromising position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart-based counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first season match, after 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic added to his team: The 23-year-old Serbe cashed after a jersey hit Daniel Didavi Yellow-Rot.
Although Stuttgart's defenders Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert goalters brought the Bremers back to play by a Kurioses Einwurf owner (68th), a quarter of a hour before Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters acting in excess back to the Siegesstraße.
Nürnberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereignly.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already took the home team on the course by using Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
Today, around 1.8 million citizens in Macedonia agree on whether their country's name should be changed to northern Macedonia.
With a yes, the almost three decades of weakening conflict could be resolved with neighbor Greece.
Athens had existed on a name change due to its similarly named northern province and blocked any approach to Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future West Integration.
The U.S. had announced that the country could soon become a member of NATO at a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrian in U-Haft.
Refugees attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beaten three pensioners and injured them in part severely.
On Friday, 41-year-old Asylumwer had ran off at 22 o’clock in the escape gas in Alsergrund.
When the police came in, they spoke to the accused, who had balled feet on passersby and tried to attack them, on his behavior.
Then the Syrians tried to beat the officials and step down.
Little later, it turned out that the suspect had hit three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his feet to the ground in the Wehringer Straße at a tram stop.
He also walked the trio with his feet.
The pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, pregnancies, and brain shocks.
The asylum worker was also seriously injured, as was the case with the police, because of the unknown cause.
He was brought to the hospital and monitored continuously during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost a year after marriage began, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership has not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the “picture” newspaper.
“If we marry, then he’s been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budget-political spokesman for the SPD National Day Group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Circle, the conservative SPD Group.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had been infuriated with anger on 30 June 2017.
So he had accused Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having \"tolled\" himself on the subject.
“This was your Schabowski moment,” he said in a statement on the accidental proclamation of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to enter their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters heck cut
There was a lot of work to be done in front of the members of the Children's House and the Society for Leprakunde.
For around 400 meters heck around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfrönderhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
“We are doing this to reduce costs,” said Walter Schröer, chairman of the Walter Schröer Civil Association.
And so did some of them.
Because of the hot summer, we are late this time, but fortunately it is only a shape cut.
In the spring, you have already shot the heck.
The following breakfast has a long tradition as well.
“There should be all the forces,” said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner gets gold at the Kanuslalom World Cup
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the conclusion of the Kanuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old put a perfect run on Sunday on the Olympia line.
Two years ago he missed Olympia bronze by three hundred seconds.
I was well prepared, had already had enough rides here at the facility and it has everything right today - said London’s third-party Olympia in 2012.
In the goal, he threw his paddle away in joy and drew both arms victoriously to the height - knowing that it would be at least rich for a medal.
After all, he had a start number of four.
But the six remaining starters were unable to tap his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
Second, Cheche Jiri Prskavec was born before the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting police inspection mentions the first opening attempt this fall into a single-family home.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are going to be shorter - that's what investors want to take advantage of.
The police inspection of Gauting announced the first opening attempt of this autumn yesterday.
The fact that it has remained at the one-family house on the King's Way is due to the alarm system.
It went off when the perpetrators laid their hands on Friday just before 20 p.m.
The residents knew that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, was apparently surprised to see it escape without prey.

Pleite at Hertha: from reality: Bayern against Ajax demands
The predestination is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin wants the FC Bayern to be \"not to be liked\"
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate for the time of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small power divide under the new coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase to the greater autumnal depth for the Munichers.
“A week ago we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now, a little bit of reality has caught us up, Thomas Müller, after the earned 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and asked for a response for the Champions League Duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Who knows us, who knows that it's right to anger us and we're going to give gas to Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year out, no own goal has been shot, as at the same time of the previous season two mandatory games in series without a win, the table management in the football national league was previously lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running intense man-on-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needlesticks across the outside have delivered two blue breaks within three days, just as the last overwhelming Bayern are to be cracked.
“Those who know FC Bayern know that we don’t like that and we will do everything we can to be successful again,” Kovac said.
On the other hand, with his losers in his hometown, he was surprisingly gentle, and his first defeat as Münchner Coach was just on the way back to a lack of opportunities.
A win against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still have the first intermediate period of his term of office before the break of the country, otherwise the sound might have been worsened.
So Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second royal class appearance of this season after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax, which had also forced AEK Athens to take off sovereignly with 3:0.
“Now we’ve caught up in two games, but we’re going to make our goals again,” National Team captain Manuel Neuer announced.
As after the lost Pokal final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same point, Joshua Kimmich spoke clearly.
The defender appeared in the role as Mahner.
“I don’t think that’s all that bad, we’ve got to rework because we don’t make the multitude of opportunities and make the mistakes at the back,” said the 23-year-old shortly before departing from Olympiastadion.
On the seventh playing day of the previous season, the Bayern was even behind Dortmund with five counters, which now took the lead again.
And so Kimmich appreciated at least positively with an eyebrow core that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bayern has now ended.
“Yes, that’s good,” the national player said.
It's good for the league.
DFB-Boss in Schussline: Özil-Causa: Sharp Attack by Erdogan an Grindel
With severe allegations, Turkish President Erdogan calls for the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
Although DFB president Greendel sees mistakes, he defends the line of association.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - At different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the importance of interpretation in the ongoing struggle theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish State President strongly criticized the treatment of the ex-world champion in Germany for opening the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
On the early Sunday morning, Özil’s personally sharp-attacked grindel in the Mainzer ZDF-“Sportstudio” announced consequences from the Causa.
“In the future, because we also have a lot of players with migration background in the U teams, we have to draw very accurate conclusions that this is not repeated,” said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel once again stated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and DFB.
In sharp words, this had prompted racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They cut them off from this society because they could be photographed with me in England,” Erdogan said on Saturday in the Domstadt.
I can honestly say that as her president, our two young men, who have ascended to the German national team, have not been ostracized.
Greendel referred to Gündogan’s statement that, unlike Özil, he felt “reasonably treated by the DFB” by photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to put himself in front of players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German when I lose, I'm a Migrant - I'm not.
“That he has such an impression, I’m very sorry,” Grindel said.
We had to defend Mesut more, I always said.
However, he does not see a basis for returning Özil to the national team.
As a consequence, in addition to the birth of Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is to be appointed.
“If a non-migration background clearly affects society and football, it says: “The issue is important, as we have to take care of ourselves — that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our associations on site where integration needs to work,” Greendel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run again for office as DFB president in the coming year.
“I’m doing my job and trying to do them as well as I can,” Grindel said.
Year-round builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As police report, the 75-year-old has caused accidents on Friday between 10 and 13 p.m.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was addressed by a lady at the red amphitheater in the area of Lauterer Hoch.
He told the pensioner that he would be driving against her car.
However, there was no exchange of staff, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady on the parking lot.
A short time later, a telephone call from the police arrived on a car driver who had come down from the road and had been driving against a guidepost.
To that end, the man did not want police on the site and was then driven away.
After that, the Rödentaler went home.
However, the pensioner in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, has taken steps and rammed a construction vehicle while turning.
Finally, the police were able to find and stop him.
His car caused significant accident.
The 75-year-old made a real impression and could no longer stand out in many ways.
The damage is $1300.
\"Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost a thousand active forces are still in use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a Federal Armed Forces ground in Emsland, 980 active forces are still engaged in the deletion work.
This was announced by the Federal Armed Forces on Sunday.
As the situation of a spokesperson continues to develop stablely, 70 honorary helpers were recently withdrawn.
Another reduction in the number of forces of use is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and deleted.
Last week, the disaster was lifted, which was called out well a week earlier on September 21 because it was feared that the flames would endanger neighboring forests and settlements by wind and spark flight.
On Thursday it was called a fire raid on adjacent communities no longer threatened.
At the time, more than 1500 active forces were trying to get the big fire under control on the site.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Federal Armed Forces Test ground at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
For the 2nd and 5th of October, according to Bundeswehr, it is also planned to re-enlighten flights with \"Tornados\".
The fire was triggered by test missiles that had fired Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand was temporarily moved up to 100 kilometers across the north-west of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up an address that will receive damage messages.
First compensation requirements had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharine in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost a year after marriage began, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year after opening the marriage for everyone, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership has not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the “picture” newspaper.
If we marry, we'll be right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budget-political spokesman for the SPD National Day Group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Circle, the conservative SPD Group.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had been infuriated with anger on 30 June 2017.
So he had accused Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having \"tolled\" himself on the subject.
“This was your Schabowski moment,” he said in a statement on the accidental proclamation of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to enter their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with adoption law.
Referendum in Macedonia started on new state names
In Macedonia, the proposed referendum on a new name for this small Balkans state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state will be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its similarly named northern province of neighboring Greece.
For almost three decades, Athens has blocked any approach of Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote with Yes, they will also give the launch committee for the West Integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donor
The register is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve members in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed with explicit consent, Swiss transplant emphasizes.
(dpa) On this Monday, Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors.
This is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve members in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be obtained from Swiss transplant in case of need.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed with explicit consent, Swiss transplant, as in Germany.
It is estimated that 15% of Swiss people have a donor ID, says Franz Always, director of the Swiss transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases, a card will be found at the crucial moment with possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, members do not know the wishes of the deceased.
“You will then have to make a deputy decision in the sense of the deceased, which is often very stressful — so always.
A similar registration system already exists in Britain.
In Germany, there is a need to save information on possible organ donations on the health insurance card, as the spokesperson for the Federal Center for Health Information, Marita Volks-Albert says.
“A register in which people can enter their wishes - per or counter organ donation - does not exist,” she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has expressed concern for a new regulation of organ donations.
According to his proposal, at first everyone would be considered an organ donor unless he or she disagreed with each other.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is the world champion in head accounting
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion.
He spent the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 contestants.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Greß from Germany took third place.
The youngest WM participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as chief divorce judge Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where guests from the audience appeared with pocket furniture.
Wenzel showed greetings from Lastrup, as he held a ball with his head in the air while reclining.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Two years ago, he was a 14-year-old man in Bielefeld.
With terms such as super-heart, genius or wonder child, organizer Laue can start little.
“The head count can be trained,” he said.
Many participants spent several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are data competitions even in stages.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root draw of six-digit numbers.
In the multifaceted calculation, the candidates are given surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans had good chances, said the chief divorce judge.
Otherwise, Asians are often in advantage because there are already intensive head calculations there and with other effective methods.
Intrusive appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early recognition
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams is shown from their sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point to breast cancer with this video and get stronger for early recognition.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings on top without the song \"I Touch Myself - by the group \"The Divinyls\" - only their hands cover their most intimate positions.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of this.
The emotional video is part of the “I Touch Myself” project that involves breast cancer early recognition that can save lives.
Serena Williams would have died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia, there were complications.
An emergency OP was introduced to save the baby's life.
In the case of a subsequent CT, blood lumps were subsequently discovered in Serena’s lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans a clear expansion of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkis-Blue Coalition will send an appropriate bill on the so-called \"Symbol Law\" in review.
This means that the number of terrorist or comparable groups recorded by the ban should be significantly expanded.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Mrs. Holle shakes out her beds for the first time next week in the West: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow at strong intensity up to about 1,000 meters.
From Bregenzerwald to the High Tauers, it is estimated to be above 2,000 meters by 20 to 40 centimeters of new snow.
The road conditions are therefore winter-like on higher-lying passports (Arlbergpass, Timmelschichte, Bieler Hoch, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße).
Farmers are allowed to start the annual knick care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start their annual knick care on Monday.
The unique “green whelms” in Germany have shaped the landscape of the poor federal state for about 200 years.
The up to five-foot-wide tree and shrub fences are \"walter set\" and for many animals and plants the last retreat spaces.
Knicks join as corridors scattered living spaces, which can still function in the exchange of organisms, as the managing director of the NaBU in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The knicks were built on the basis of a command of Dane King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The “living fences” were not only field-limiting and livestock, they also provided the farmers with firewood and bars for their specialist houses.
From that time on, his name \"Knick\" also comes: By \"turning around\" the estuaries could develop the dense, intertwined delimitations.
Today, between the North and the Baltic Sea, around 45,000 kilometers of hedges are located and the image of a woody, diverse, structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a replacement habitat by about 7,000 species of animals.
In a mile of knick, up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 bird pairs.
Its ecologically important function, however, can only be fulfilled if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Otherwise, he cares for a light tree series, which, in addition to the diversity of species, also inflames the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
Knickcare may be operated only outside the breeding period from October to March, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
According to Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talk about situation on site
The local Radika Pinto describes the situation on site on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami in an interview with the German editorial network Germany (RND):
Were you on site during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport was closed at Palu at the time.
What is the situation on the island?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid goods can also be flown.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our office of World Vision has also been destroyed, but we have set up something temporary where we have also housed other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many are run down the surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they do not have access to water and food.
Some keep up with their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many food stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people partially claw food and gasoline.
The public service has been completely downgraded, which helps the national government out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners were partially walking freely around, and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not been found and are missing.
How does communication and information on the island run?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but previously it didn’t work and we only got information about the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people they don’t know if they are living and where they are going because people were not at home during the earthquake but, for example, on the job.
The tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don’t know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many “Okay, no tsunami” thought — and then he came.
In other regions that have not been hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they were run to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, which is on the Pacific fire ring, not prepared for earthquakes?
But there are earthquakes every day, but that was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
muscle injuries against becomers: VfB needs to stay on Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing from the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
At 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, Aogo added a muscle fiber riss in the rear left upper leg, the football team member announced on Sunday.
At Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundler in the upper arm.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hanover 96 on Saturday and will probably still miss matches even after the following national game break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not pass a forecast for the fallout period.
A muscle bundle crack usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber crack usually heals a little faster.

Biathlet Julian Eberhard receives World Cup medal
The fourth place at Olympia was in the stomach by Biathlet Julian Eberhard.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to pick up the missing precious metal at the WM in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in Pyeongchang’s Olympic sprint to grab the medal.
Seven tenths of seconds were missing at the end of bronze.
“I made a conscious effort to process that,” says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym Fitness Studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in the top form, but it just didn’t want to be.
The most motivated is the pinzgauer to pick up the missing precious metal in the new season: “The goal can only be to come back with the Constitution to a grand event to win something.
At some point, you have to hit it too.
The WM trail in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: “I have already closed the track in my heart,” he recalls with joy at his fourth World Cup spot in the single race in the previous year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only single win for Austria in the last World Cup winter in Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the staff he ran in Oslo (NOR) on grade two.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in Turbotempo
Time is extremely scarce and the number of things planned is greatly limited.
With an FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the high-density majority for the justice candidates Brett Kavanaugh, who are controversial.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for the investigators until Friday to clarify the more than 30 years behind the alleged incidents.
The latest turn in the drama for the Kavanaughs vocation accompanied by a cultural campaign was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in the course of which the lawyer was angry with the opposition Democrats, the Senate’s Justice Committee should make the way out for the final confirmation of the archconservative judge at the Supreme U.S. Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when, suddenly, Senator Jeff Flake declared against his original announcement, he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had still referred to the difficult stays on Thursday as “bess,” initially faced further attacks on women and spoke of ‘happiness in the accident’.
In this way, the last question could be raised, he said.
Later, in an election announcement, Trump strongly attacked Democrats because they rejected Kavanaugh: “They are trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
One will specifically investigate the well-known accusations of two women, no more, a government representative said to the “Wall Street Journal”: “They’re not going on a fishing trip.”
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile, installed in a “Burn Vehicle” radar of the City Council to monitor the pace limit is stationed on the Garden Street, according to the city council from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Center.
The city community also operates several fixed installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You’ve felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season win against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season victory.
However, Mainz also played a role in the factor of time.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime, it is widely known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
“I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room - said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
Finally, the king’s blues managed to bring the narrow 1:0 against the Rhinehesse over time and thus the first season victory under roof and subject.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Creator 11 of the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given security to Tedesco: “In sum, the first half was good, both playful and pressing, with increasing playing duration, obviously more and more the head played a role.
Don't actually create a headball unheated
“The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me,” Heidel said, “if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that.”
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore retreated.
And with man and mouse defend against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
“We’ve all fallen a huge stone from the heart,” said Schöpf, who, with his headball hit, did not have an unessential share: “I’m actually the worst headball player in the manpower.”
But in the end, only the victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
“We wanted to start printing in the initial phase and make a fireworks from it,” Schalkes said.
Victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We've played intelligent, quiet and brave, so we've got to go to games over 90 minutes.
The biggest manko in the afternoon: King Blue missed out on more clear conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice met the Latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
“Then it wouldn’t have been a sitter’s win,” Tedesco said, “you’ve already felt the fear a little bit.”
That's why I'm glad we won.
He was not the only sheller.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire on Sunday at 13:30 p.m.
Now the police determine.
Fischbachau - The cause found police and firefighters soon out: An unknown had lit on a two-square-foot-wide area on the Gsch occasionally mountain garbage.
According to police, it seemed as if he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the glut unattended.
And that in the vicinity of the forest.
30 Fischbachauer firefighters were involved in the withdrawal and deletion.
The police are now on fire.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye height
In front of them is the author, Professor of Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He followed for the repeated invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
“I have been working on getting interesting people to Greven for many years,” explains the founder and chairman of the ‘Reckfield Meeting’ - that association that cooperates with the Alliance’s cultural policy in the direction of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describing the writing process of the book, talking about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, hand-held numbers and one or other jokes, it brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts increasing despite successful integration?
The Syrian-based author serves in answering the question of a metaphor.
At a table, the German society, the first generation’s migrants, sits at the cat’s table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to join.
This led to conflicts.
That is why it is not a matter of whether one orders himself politically to the right or to the left, but of “I am for or against an open society,” he emphasizes.
At first, it would be better to behave, then always raining the round of discussion.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands before, not on stage, a sense picture of the discussion: it's at eye level.
The sociology professor does not push his opinion, stressing that he is talking about the average, not about individual fates.
He is pleased that interest in the subject exists because “first of all, when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions,” says El-Maalani.
Even during the subsequent signatory hour, he has also become an open ear for the questions of guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, intensively discussed.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen wins up-to-date games

Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is apparently huge: over 100 interested people have applied for the purchase of one of the property in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pleining sold the first estates in the new building area of Landsham-South on the free market.
That's what Mayor Roland Frick said.
In addition, the application phase is completed for those 20 estates that offer the municipality more favorable conditions or prices - similar to the previous domestic model.
A hundred applications have been received, says Frick.
“At present, the documents will be reviewed - with regard to application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Pleininger Mayor, the goal is to have the applicant ranking for the 20 estates by the end of the year and to present them to the municipal council.
After that, the award could be made.
In total, 50 plots are created on the area south of Landsham for single and double houses as well as four areas for multi-family homes with expected eight housing units each.
The opening is now as well completed as it is, the roads and roads are to soon be asphaltized.
A single plot and two of the multifamily houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 estates in the socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multifamily homes of the municipality are to be built as a affordable living space.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments funded by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Grob estimates are being created on the area of the new building area Landsham-South residential space for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, in early October, according to Frick, the start for the rebuilding of a day-to-day facility is taking place there.
There are three children's garden and three cripple groups as well as a multipurpose space.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
Schalkes Naldo’s “big sport” also succeeds on the bank.
For the third time, not in the start-elf: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks to Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had sat in the Schalker Startelf for the third time, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great in many people if the nearly two-metre-tall Brazilian had spoken so correctly the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual in the middle circle and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old who called all the simplicity-half Naldo turned on and said, “We have to thank you, coach.”
“This was very emotional, that was a great sport,” Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice captain, who, despite his reservist existence, did not have any grout.
Naldo probably knows, who was celebrated as the best sheller in the past season, that he did not actually get on the set-off for his coach, but got a break for good reasons.
One reason called “tax control”
It was not easy to tell him that.
“It wasn’t easy to tell him that, I tell you quite honestly,” Tedesco reported about the moment he told Naldo that he wasn’t in the start-up.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the association, Tedesco founded the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that you can get through all of this at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat, Tedesco explained the rotation, which has also recently caught Naldo.
And to whom the Brazilians responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also pointing to the bank as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria’s industry continued to accelerate in August as compared to the Eurozone.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month depth.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third best vote behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced its survey among 3,000 companies on Monday.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the Eurozone has risen by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is nevertheless the 13th month in consequence under the brand of 50 counters that indicate growth.
In August, only Ireland’s industry hit 50.9 points this threshold.
Finally, the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer decreased, but was slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level with 44.0 points since March.
“The easily weakened valley trip could mean that the worst was over,” said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, in the third quarter, the industry remains number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: the export orders in the eurozone fell as strongly as since November 2011.
The companies therefore built the seventh month in consecutive positions.
In China, industrial production was also lower in August than initially accepted.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
At first, experts expected 47.8 points.
The Shopping Manager Index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, the developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices will be increased.
Tuchel's PSG team managed behind victory in the eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45 p.m.
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel runs with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship further from victory to victory.
At OGC Nice, the title defender won with 3:0 (1:0) thanks to two matches by Superstar Neymar and was successful in the eighth league game as well.
More recently, Olympique Lyon in France had set a fine start to the game time in 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and made the final stand in the post-game period.
Christopher Nkunku (46) provided the intermediate 2:0.
This also helped Paris win the general test for the leading second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At 2:3 in Liverpool, Tuchel’s team had to take down the only mandatory game defeat this season.
