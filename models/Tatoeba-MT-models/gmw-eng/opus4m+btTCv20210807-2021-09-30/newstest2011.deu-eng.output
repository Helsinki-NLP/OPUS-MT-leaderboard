What should they do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort, nor the \"conditories\"
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has once \"clopped off\" members of the new council from the ČSSD, as they are the notoretic snake that has settled in the last few years in which today's coalition partners in Prague were on the rudder.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the next era by Mayor Pavel Bém, is among the most famous players, situations, and Causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils showed that something was going on in the dark with regard to these new terms.
At least that is what they claim.
“Who is Voldemort”
“No idea.”
\"I'm more a newcomer in Prague politics - Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, responded to the test of \"patten vocabulary\"
But also Mr Karel Březina, a political veteran, responded in a similar way.
For example, on the term \"golfhole\"
“This is the only expression of those you present to me here that I use over and over again.
“Otherwise, I don’t think much of snakes.
From the vocabulary published by the Journal of Aktuálně.cz in this June before the election Congress of the ODS, the editorial picked out six terms, especially those notoriety related to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms \"voldemort\" - the largest of Prague's Gulfholes - in terms of conditory - \"star-nakes\" - \"deal of the capital - and \"verb\".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague School, promised to participate first, but did not even take the listener off.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused the test from the outset.
“These things are no matter to me, and how the citizens of Democrats deal with each other, I do not judge them,” he said.
“For me, it’s important that we understand ourselves in the context of our programs,” he said.
As already noted, in the above-mentioned headline, Lukáš Kaucký would not have recognized that the speech is by the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex-Oberbürgersmeister Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term “full-place,” says Kaucky nothing at all, and the only term he experienced correctly during the test was “the largest Prague golf hole.”
“That’s the tunnel Blanka,” Kaucký said, adding to safety, “but I’m more aware of that from the newspaper.”
“I’m going to have to take a language course,” he said.
The \"Golfloch\" is then not only used by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the councillor for environmental issues Lukáš Plachý properly as a tunnel Blanka.
However, both social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even doesn't even know where this figure can be found and what it means to \"go into the conditory\"
“I think that’s to go into some Prague gastronomy business,” Plachý is quite close to the puzzle solution when you know that this is the seat of Janoušek’s companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he claims to have created this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary would be his own.
According to the test participants, there really does not seem to be a similar slang among the social Democrats.
“I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there’s something like this that isn’t really there for us.
“We call on the name, we also use short or nicknames,” says the president of Prague’s ČSSD Petr Hulínský, by his partymate Salopp “Hulda”.
“In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” Karel Březina told us.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see - he works there.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the party members of the 'opa' or less friendly of the 'alte' representative Miroslav Poche, who, before the elections, made himself aware of the party-sponsoring, is known by some colleagues as 'Igráček' (known Czech Lego bodies).
So names are the only thing that allows the social Democrats to use in the domestic language.
Hulínský does not seem to like it if it is called “Hulda” but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname \"Doctor of the Rubber Knüppel Rights\" has allegedly to do with Petr Hulínský's acquisition of his title Doctor Juris at the Bratislav police academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of \"hexes\" and release a brochure
Women who are stamped to witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to belong to the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are empty and have no children.
If one of these women becomes a witch, she will be strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
“People are rarely affected by this fate,” he said.
“Even young and healthy women are saved because they help with the work and give birth to children,” describes a sister-in-law who cares for more than a hundred women who were expelled from their communities in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal social action.
And for this reason, issued a brochure which is intended to prevent the “hexen pursuit.”
But the thing has a hook.
\"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read - pointing the newspaper 'the standard' to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
The practice of witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they poured them over with Petroleum and just lit them on.
This incident, among other things, also reported to the BBC server.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the matter would only have been a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version, oil is flamed, which is used to ritual ointments.
And after the group tried to drive out a evil spirit from the woman,
The isolation of “hexes” supports people here with no regard to their education.
“The standard,” he said, quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: “Fearers of human souls are at risk earlier than they are today.”
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to deplete the witch hunt, the Gambian president has carefully mixed himself with the president in the past year.
President Yahya Jammeh revealed a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, as they were supposed to share in their deaths and now would try to kill the president himself by black magic.
“To this end, he called on Shamane from the nearby Guinea to help, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the president’s bodyguard, led violently captured women and men out of gambian villages and brought them to the farm in Kanilai,” the organization Amnesty International reported.
On the farm, the incubated people were forced to drink an acid of plants with hallucinogenic effects, but also caused intestine and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of the international pressure, the nearly a thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant from Bakala: He does heat in the oven - still pays higher rent
An elderly understated man just leaves the client center of the company RPG Byty of the \"Kohlebaron\" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm, a map with three new rental contracts to three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who just had a prison sentence.
All three were just increased as part of the so-called 'deregulation'.
Instead of 3,500 crowns of monthly rent, the son is expected to beat for a 2-room apartment with a second-class 4100 crown kitchen next year.
“And there is no even flowing hot water in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal oven - he tips with his finger on the new rent contract of the Son, to which he has a full power.
\"But what - signed I have - he explains half agreed and half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz Civil Association, which referred to the new rental conditions as “corrupt and immoral,” advises tenants to simply not sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7 to publish guidance on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man just turns off.
“One says this, the other does it, making a dark face.
The region of Ostrava becomes a major deregulation laboratory.
After New Year’s Eve, this deregulation is expected to be most of the rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid market-oriented rents.
So Aktuálně.cz decided to visit this “Labor” in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o’clock in the morning on this Tuesday.
Just next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a call device.
“With 2011, this is how a special key will shine on the touchscreen.
Shortly tipped and the device is already spitting out a number set.
We've just dropped the number 157, and it's already peaking on the big display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
A half second later you are on the line.
A little later, an elderly couple enter the waiting room to ask for rent, but the insurgency in the waiting room evidently does not apply to the new rental.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance issues and similar ones.
From mid-November, in the region of Ostrava, the Kuverts with the new rental contracts will flat the most tenants of the total of 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG into the letter boxes.
The RPG Byty suggests a rent increase of around 15 to 38 percent in writing.
The special switch for the new rentals in the client centre has been open since November 18.
“The action runs a little over a week, that is, it’s only the beginning,” replied the ladies behind the switch after a moment when the “Client” emerged as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala's former miners' apartments are a brizzling topic.
Before the elections, the President of Parliament Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD had quite loudly raised this issue, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
“For twenty years, I want a new floor of them.
“Not once did they have to change toilet glasses,” the man mentioned at the outset makes himself air.
Until now, according to the employees, mainly pensioners are on the switch to convince themselves if they really get the promised rent discount that RPG promises them when they sign the special offer in time.
In the pleasure of a half reduced February rent, the other tenants are also to come and sign the new rental contract until 15 December.
Until now, however, “deregulation switch” in Havířov is anything but overloaded by demand.
“From yesterday’s 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rents in 2011 were due to here - the switch officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites, as well as wall tables, where it appears necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rental, they will be determined by an independent court.
“This is not to be a threat, but is to be understood as information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure,” RPG explains on its websites.
“No one goes to court here,” says one of RPG Byty’s employees and a man on the street in front of the client center, at least partially right her.
“I have 13,000 pensions, of which 5,000 remain for food, where I should take the money for a court dispute,” he said.
Then the employee becomes uncertain.
\"See Mal -
\"Mr. Zaoralek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so people are still waiting for it, she says.
The regulated rent ends in most Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the increase in rent is an economic necessity.
“The existing level of rent is not enough to maintain the housing fund,” says Pavel Klimeš, the director of the company’s apartment portfolio RPG Byty, and - just the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the tenants is, in the opinion of the homeowners, the main reason for the increase in rent.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in apartments from 2005 to 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it was expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the cushion chairs in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red-lighting information will be found between the two.
“The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less concerns 31 200 apartments, that is more than 90% of RPG’s housing.
“This means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter and month - can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from RPG's portfolio increase by 38 percent.
“In these cases, it’s about increasing extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square meter,” RPG argues.
At 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same height next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not jump the rents to the height, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What more - the company imposes a further obligation: all revenue from the increase in rent (see diagram) wants to put the company back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - into new windows and into heat insulation.
But, of course, these are to benefit the people who sign the agreements on the increase in rent.
The architects saw one - the office also belongs to a kindergarten.
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new seat of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with everything that includes: colourful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-play place on the outside terrace.
This Kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees for the past year.
The Arch.Design projecting and architecture office, from which studios come a number of famous Brunner buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building with the premises for its company mini-kindergarten.
Wisely, because most of its 90 employees are in the baby tree age and the company is based on the fact that the projectants return to their jobs as soon as possible.
Along with the possibility of working shorter, the kindergarten is another bonus offered by Arch.Design to its employees in the concept of their social programme.
Construction engineers have the easier way to bring their demanding profession and child care under a hat.
The minikindergarten is an original idea of the employees (inner) of Arch.Design and with the support of management, they managed to win funding funds from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social for their project.
The operational mini-kindergarten is funded by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operation Programme from the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic State Budget.
Thanks to this funding (contributions of 2.8 million CZK), the necessary facilities and equipment could be provided and for the duration of 2 years qualified personnel and operations were provided.
After the expansion of the funding funds (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the minikindergarten 3 for more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place for a whole year, with the company’s Economy Rating providing active assistance in the application process.
The children take care of fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a mini-kindergarten, at the same time only 5 children may be present, but the day changes over several children.
The kindergarten company is flexiblely tailored to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights with regard to the use of the kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although these are individual education and care, the programme content in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless similar to the pre-school training framework program.
The children are not only playing here, especially they are given excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, but also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also equipped with a computer that is available to the children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus avoid the stress when taking the children out of a far away kindergarten.
Parents use their working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that natural and loyal employer-worker relationships are also formed here.
Arch.Design has come into contact with Czech companies that offer significant benefits to new employees who are family-friendly and strengthen their staff marketing through such programs.
A bone house also fascinates after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof moves on like the back of a prehistoric eche, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn up fish mills.
This is the Casa Batlló of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The house, with its organic forms, was named “Knochenhaus” by its inhabitants.
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, chicken plitters and mosaics, all of which are typical features of Antonio Gaudi’s youth style.
The facade of the house plays with beautiful lines, tender colors and textures that remind of nature and living beings.
It is only with more accurate observation that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thought-provoking order.
During the night, the entire facade still acts more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting still strengthens the shine of the colors.
The same swung lines and slanted shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Well-shaped wood copies the window frames, rails, cider elements of doors, yes even guckles and performances.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district at Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was built by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, which the architect Emilio Sala Cortese carried out.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally lived on the demolition of the old building and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed with the idea Gaudís for an unusual and even cheaper conversion.
However, the rental house Casa Batlló did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josef Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner and the use of mosaics at the façade were just on its zip board.
However, the design of the façade also involved numerous other artists and artists.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Thus, Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá house in the park Güell, where there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given by the so-called inhabitants of its organic forms because of the nickname “Knochenhaus”
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the \"like-minded house\"
It is also said that the sword of the Holy Georg, the patron of Catalonia, is depicted at the top of the building.
But also other sculptoric elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces for the time being.
Something bizarre is already encouraging her 45-degree appearance.
In his creation, Gaudí consistently ignored all of the then building regulations and could not be stopped by them.
Even before the construction began, he obtained from the city the corresponding building permit, but the information he had made about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the city fathers were so outraged by the result that they requested relief.
The councillors are also concerned that the construction of its pillars is even taking place in the public sector.
However, there were no changes, on the contrary, only fifteen days after the call of the city district was issued, Josep Batlló made an application to approve the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was granted to him promptly.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor was a company salon, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was dedicated to a jewelry business.
The entire six-story building runs through a stairs up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the conversion removed all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
Gaudí, however, also worked with a modern concept to connect rooms together.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and thus a larger society could easily plausate without having to give up on a certain intimacy during more confidential conversations.
The house received a fairly unusual roof and two other floors, except for a new façade.
Gaudí’s game is also impressive with the light as well as the blue and white glassd bowls with which the courtyard is dressed and the lighthouses.
The game of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum degree of light.
In doing so, he simply used the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló House, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can visit anyone today.
On the first floor is the most spacious and magnificent apartment made accessible to the public.
The homeowners only decided to take this step in the year and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When one found out that this is a quite accommodating business, one kept the visits, yes, one also extended them to other common and roofing areas, including the roof terrace.
However, the price of visiting the building monument is not a paper steel, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist cards get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices at other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers should try to close friendship with one of the home residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have wishes other than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the lay surface - so mattresses and roses make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the needs of the specific user.
When choosing, many things play a role - the weight, size, state of health and not least also the sex of the sleeper.
The interior in which mattresses and rusts have been subjected is equally important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house, where not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they need much longer to “get warm”
In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be used regularly.
If they do not have enough ventilation channels at the core and are still on a solid plate, moisture is on: it is therefore not excluded from forming under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Anyone who has been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses are common with soft layer, will be hard to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
“Well, all the ice hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained to me that they can’t sleep right here anymore.”
“For their skimmed shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer).
“I recommend these, among other things, sugar-borne people who suffer from a disorder in the nervous system, so that they can get the ‘information’ from the joints and skin badly,” explains Sylva Hadamczaková, who specializes in pulster furniture.
That’s why I’ve had many ice hockey players years ago, but other customers also worry about these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
“Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico.
And you don’t necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to learn to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This “wonder” actually works quite easily.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbent heat, in other words, it lubricates itself to the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, at night you don't want to get around like a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wound fire).
When choosing the mattress size, the length of the foot soles should still be calculated to the body size, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men like women who are 180 cm tall need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should be available at least 90 cm of lying width, so together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example in singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
The comfort is halved and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bed width: “If you’re on the back, you should still have enough space for the slightly angled arms,” advises Ing. Helena Prokoková, the master of the wrists and spacers, who have been dedicated to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomic of furniture for many years, and who also talks about this subject at specialist schools.
In a double bed, each needs his own rose and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise nothing remains other than to mount the rust at different heights and this is not possible for every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be removed from the mold layer and the fine wrist.
“With your hand or your hands, you can’t feel the springs at all,” he warns.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Full-bolted beds with mattresses and underlays such as co-grown Siamzwillings have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the reference cannot be washed, what is already going on and given today.
And since one loses between 0.2 to 0.75 l of welding in a single night, it is clear that the mattress will slowly become a giant (and blocked screen) after five to seven years.
This is why experts reject advertising slogans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years in mattresses, even life-long warranty.
All things have their time and place.
And that is why a practical advice from the dealers: In mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, the hygiene of washable, deductable fittings should not be avoided, yet it is recommended to use a mattresser that can easily be pulled off and washed.
Even today, though mattress references are usually produced with round-circuit cover, so that after opening you get two halfs (in person important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often like the uneven fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in the bed instead of a rust?
Get rid of it!
Or most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should prefer to use the plate with ventilation holes (if not already inside) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring cores and fine wrists.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a base.
For non-adjustable latten rosts with 14 to 18 spring bars (lattles), latex or sandwich mattresses (possibly also combinations of latex and coconuts) are always paid with a larger latten number, i.e. 28 and more spring bars, with Lordosene support in the loinsy area and the ability to regulate the latten hard.
There are no mattresses with spring skeletons on adjustable lamel rosts as they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to setting the boots of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special fastening of the spring bars, which allows to press the spring bars or even so as to enable them to sink the shoulder of the sleeper in a pointual way.
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area in the case of ‘Lord mattresses’.
Also thought to the ladies - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For most demanding customers, point-lasting wing spring systems (lattoflex) or rust with point-last contact pads with so-called multitortion suspension are determined.
The pressure is distributed to several points, thus reducing the tension.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) head pillow for the right mattress and proper rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Here is also a rule of thumb: the head pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideal for this, a 50 x 60 cm large pillow appears, as for example, the Scandinavians like it.
In the side position, the head cushion (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or soft zone in the mattress) should compensate the shoulder height.
What our modern mattresses have meant with the once-filled straw bags.
Modern manufacturers use more and more common natural materials or at least their admixtures.
Also in mattresses, the new magic word is called “Bio”
Instead of oil raw materials, polyurethane foams are increasingly used for the production of natural oils, for example Rizinus and Soy oil.
Soy is probably used by all well-known manufacturers.
“For mattresses, the core of their materials is purely natural origin,” explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
However, natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress references - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
But you can also enjoy microcapsels that spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance when sleeping.
Here, too, you make a difference between men and women.
While a “cooling” plant extract from birch leaves is used in men so that the mattress reference can absorb the heat and cool the body, the references for women’s “heating” effect.
Extracts from red pepper shots stir the blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes warm when sleeping.
And today's favorites?
mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the various boots (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, there are 7,000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually burdened with lower VAT, as they are considered medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and on the rust is not that easy.
Time and time again, there are special offers from manufacturers and traders offering two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the mattress Duofreeze with visco-shaum memory for 11,990 CZK in relation to it.
The second one is given for free.
It was the material Tempur, which introduced the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, as astronauts are exposed to enormous overburdens at the start.
Tempur is soft in heat, in the cool environment it solidifies itself again.
Thus it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure fire, but generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams, however, are used not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as in special foot wrists, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers, for example, use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to control the kids
The fear of their own children is growing and more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented for parking by car, can be as good as good people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as recently when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappears.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but soon it won’t be bigger than a bracelet watch.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Anička in fear and horror and thus keep them looking forward to better protecting their children by means and ways.
Also for the price of a breach of their privacy.
“We’re trying to tell everyone that this is not about herm spying, but about an effective means to reduce the likelihood of tragedy,” says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil company, one of the suppliers of GPS location devices on the Czech market.
“I admit that in individual cases it can come to the abuse of such devices, for example, if you put it in someone’s pocket without knowing it, but we had no such case to record so far.”
“Most customers really buy it for security reasons,” adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the \"shaft\" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, the child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn’t like to wear such a thing, it’s easy to get rid of him.
“Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they don’t want to be controlled.”
“At first, the phones awakened big expectations from the parents, but they can be turned off as easily as these new surveillance devices are,” says Mrs. Bočková.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
In planned kidnappings, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with which it could be arranged.
“Today it’s the mobile phone.”
“If such surveillance devices were more widely used, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising,” he said.
“In these cases, police criminals are always one step ahead,” says the psychologist.
However, she argues that similar devices can be very helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of RC Monitoring, which offers location services for both automobiles and persons, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
“The device can be set in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals.”
\"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the data subject is available -
“In the case of more expensive devices, even an inclination knife is integrated, that is, if you are falling and staying motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position,” Mr. Čech said.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform intelligent mobile phones with navigation, only a special software is needed.
The problem with the current location devices is that they are either devices in iron wood shaft sizes, which resemble trailers or smaller phones.
There is always the danger of losing it.
Mr Pilin of Macro Weil is therefore tested in the present devices that look like normal digital watches.
“This has the advantage that the possible attacker should not realize at all that it is a surveillance or location device.
\"Or, after some time, he notices what the police are giving a time lead,\" he added.
No matter what direction the development is going - to armbands or trailers, the same technology is always used, as in vehicle location.
So for the combination of location function using the GPS system (just like the navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many thunderstorms that one could redevelopment all of the Czech Republic but only hold two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of tin barrels, being lit with explosives.
The year before, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of scourging to the army camps.
It is comforting to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the sine cord - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the fence of the stock company STV Group, a.k.a. for lap 40 million crowns.
In his reasoning for the purchase of this huge amount of tin barrel, the General Staff MF DNES replied that soldiers would consume the 60 kilometres of tin cord annually.
According to the research of Army pyrotechnics, which MF DNES called for, this indicates that the entire army had to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the Army Command, to the secretaries.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only then could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of sine cords be justified in half.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But so would these army stocks for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that for training each new professional soldier, two meters of scourage is completely sufficient, then the army has created a calming supply for the already mentioned 225 years, even under the point of view of the increased needs of the pioneer and special units.
Soldiers of the rapid deployment brigades recently complained to Minister of Defence Vondra that they had almost no patrons for handguns, so that shooting exercises of the missing means are severely restricted.
Stay silent about the underhospital deficiency.
“I also don’t understand why they are buying out such an abundance of sinews from us.
But this is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need.
“For us, the army is a good customer we would like to face as a dealer,” says STV Group’s sales manager Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, founded the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of thunderstorms, which the army had covered with this \"munition\" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year duration of use of the fence and police and army pyrotechnics, just two years old.
“In perfect storage, the four mentioned years are likely possible, but one who wants to remain unnamed, in order not to be condemned by the army as a soldier.
After the duration of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and not the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not in vain but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers of fence.
“They cost us sixty percent less than last year’s delivery of 244 kilometers,” Mr. Pejšek told us, the Minister of Defense.
For example, the annual consumption of fences of pyrotechnics from the police, the munitions from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherly Army has flown for almost 1,500 meters for a few years.
And the police are always ordering only such amounts of this ammunition that it can consume even before the duration of use.
The safety of pyrotechnics is already due to, in addition, to the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore also reliable tinting cords.
The Ministry of Defense has had huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-headed Czechoslovakian People's Army prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to pyrotechnicians, who addressed MF DNES, the Czech armed forces are expecting the same problem in liquidating hundreds of kilometers of long-term fences, which they have bought so “favorably” today.
To this day, the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition
The successful placement in the competition — Small Entrepreneurs of the Year — helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
Winner of the last year’s competition “Little Entrepreneur of the Year” was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success feels like a film scene.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that there is a lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his vacation work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he was able to build a house with five apartments.
Remember, he was a high school student in the sixth semester, and that was certainly a brave undertaking.
“The price-quality ratio at the time irritated me and so I tried to do something against it,” says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first rebuilt apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit in the house, which he subsequently converted step by step to retirement with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four guesthouses in Liberec in just seven years, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel \"Pytloun Design Hotel\"
This year another first-class hotel was added.
“We have already signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties at the franchise of Pytloun hotels have already signed up,” says the entrepreneur number one of the previous year.
\"Great share of this license sale to operate hotels had just the victory in the competition - Entrepreneur of the year - Mr Pytloun added recognition.
The victory brought him greater fame, yes popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me after all, and I have to say that it did well,” he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You also don’t have to win the same, every visualization is good.
He says that he is benefiting from the contacts and acquaintances to which it would otherwise not have come at all.
“With some people I have met thanks to the competition, I still maintain regular business relations to this day.
In his opinion, the fame associated with the success is also a little on each of his employees.
And there he went to the seventy.
“I notice with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that will be given to general recognition.”
I really don’t see this as a personal success, no, that’s the result of the good work of all of us.
“My name is only something in the foreground,” says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my followers a quieter year when we had farmed it
Victory euphoria was quickly eliminated from the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal effort, Farmet has the worst behind him.
The prize for the first rank of the competition Vodafone company last year was taken over by Karel Žárský, the company owner of Farmet.
At the time, the jury appreciated the efforts he made to stamp out a company from the small tool building in Česká Skalice, which makes hundreds of millions of turnovers.
“I can say that this appreciation not only encouraged myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-awareness in the fight with competition,” says the previous year’s winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet, the effort was to do something useful.
And when the state offered a small workshop for his father, Karel Žárský, as compensation for the property seized by the Communists, he did not hesitate for a long time to have his career in the company in which he had been employed, and founded a company to produce plastics with a few comrades of his father.
A short time later, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have risen to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only through the success in the mentioned competition and its medialization has it also entered the consciousness of the non-factory.
“Not only has our customers now seen the Farmet brand significantly more intensively, but our foreign partners have also begun to be able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest success in its country,” says Karel Žárský.
The last year, however, was not just in the sign of the triumphal euphoria.
The appreciation went from the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which shook even less citizens at the time, but above all businesses, reached its climax - many companies were forced to suspend their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
“Of course, we couldn’t escape this situation,” he said.
“The sales decreased by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even take action to get rid of it,” explains Charles Žțárský.
A viable company must also take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black numbers, even with lower profits than before the crisis.
For one, the company was not willing to make cuts - in investment in research and development.
“From the grant we built a research and training centre, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and acquired main prizes at domestic exhibitions,” says Ž identifyárský.
It is all a testimony to the fact that we have overcome the crisis.
The turnovers are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
“The new winner I wish a lot of joy in the victory - but in a calmer atmosphere - let Karel set up ŽСárský.
A survey of opinions that comes up with insanity rules
The opinion survey on the 'Absurdity of the Year' is a fourth time part of the entrepreneur competition.
Some unwise rules have already succeeded in creating from the world.
As a doubting winner of the next year’s opinion survey “Absurdity of the Year,” the obligation to create documents on the authorities available online increased.
So more than a third of non-very four thousand voice-giving entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the Social Security Administration requested a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have obtained it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion survey, this has changed.
“The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer demand withdrawals from the trade register in the future when social insurance payers are controlled,” said ČSSZ Jana Buragová’s spokesman.
The meaning and purpose of the opinion survey “Absurdity of the Year” is to take all the rules and arrangements under the lupe, have met the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic, and have lifted the insanity.
This is already the fourth time this year that is part of a business competition run by the German Economic Journal (HN) and is enjoying growing popularity in public.
If the three thousand people participated in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, for there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve only to hinder corporate activity.
“As regards the number of income tax forms, for example, we take a leading position in the world,” noted Karel Havlíček from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and commercial drivers of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying business activity has been the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is taking the 74th rank in terms of the terms and conditions, compared to the previous year, an eight-place worse placement.
The competition's absurdity of the year was first launched in the year and takes place every year after the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative nonsense from April to the conclusion of the competition at the end of September.
For registration, the web address www.firmaroku.cz. Then the organiser of the competition selects seven candidates for the “anti-price” and lets the public vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that most of the voices get.
For this year’s opinion survey, more than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless rules and arrangements have been submitted.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated finalists of the competition, there are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for highways and highways have to pay toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must provide every two years.
The list of this year's \"Seven\" is published on the sides of the competition.
The launch of the competition in the beginning of November at the Prague Wenzelsplatz is part of a Happening which regularly also takes part in political and public life personalities.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized companies and commercial drivers of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were at the top of the competition with the party.
“Where the state is pushing the entrepreneurs between the legs, there can be no real economic upturn, so my goal is to raise at least thirty paragraphs every year that make it even more unnecessary for entrepreneurs to do their business today,” Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Commerce, said.
The efforts to create unwise arrangements from the world show effect.
In 2007, people most of the company imposed the obligation to report to the commercial office at its permanent office three days in advance the intention to go to an exhibition or Kirmes with an exhibition stand.
This obligation was lifted in force by a novelty of the Commercial Act.
The obligation to report the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the Labour Service Traveling Office of Employees up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them.
And - all good things are three:
On the absurdity of 2009, the regulation imposed on physiotherapists was chosen to have a mirror, refrigerator and two passenger scales in the speech room.
This Regulation was mildened by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator duty fell away.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year’s 5th anniversary of the competition of the Economic Journal (HN) is the category “Responsible Company of the Year 2010”
The main idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair ventures.
“We want to support such companies who are aware of the consequences of your business on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives,” says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, the caller and guarantor of this competition, as well as the Competition Rebellion of the Year.
For this year’s first year of this special sub-class of the Vodafon company’s main competition, companies have signed up for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The history of each of them is extremely inspiring and bubbling enough fabric for a self-help article.
Although they differ in the subject matter of their activity diametrically, their efforts still have a common name - support and consideration.
For example, this is about disabled people because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, who has been the principal sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also takes care of its health disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of their workforce, for which she was credited with the title “Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region”; in the Vodafone Company’s competition of the year, she was ranked third in the context of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which, among other things, introduced a flow and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours a week without a relatively low wage.
The jury also honored the fact that the company is buying mainly with Czech manufacturers, supporting civil initiatives in its environment and working according to environmentally friendly principles.
“We are trying to recyclable as much as possible in order to keep the consequences of our business and administration as low as possible for the environment,” explains their managing director, Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the éstí nad Labem region is in turn located at the health of its employees and therefore it has supported them with all notebooks of ergonomic armchairs and keyboards, and it also promotes homework in its employees and in corporate actions it uses carting services offered by a domestic protected workshop.
\"In addition, we support the Foundation 'People in need', which provides concrete assistance to the so-called Roma community, says Ondřej Searchý, the company's representative.
Not least is the activity of the cleaning company “Praní a čištění” from the Karlsbader region, which contributes to their employees’ pension insurance in the form of extra bonuses.
“We give our employees contributions to the aid, to the way of work, to increase their qualifications and for the holiday,” says Josef Strapáč from Czasch construction company Bruntál, the winner in the Märisch-Schlesian region.
To the category of responsible company of the year, all district finalists of the Vodafon competition were automatically notified of the year, which answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer at the latest until August 15.
False or incompletely filled answers in the questionnaire were excluded by the organizer from the evaluation.
“If the representatives of the law enforcement companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition’s responsibility-conscious company of the year, but they were not disqualified in the main competition Vodafone company of the year.
“A separate registration is not possible only to this competition, as it is only a sub-class of the main competition company of the year,” explains Karel Goldman from Bison & Rose’s organizing agency.
Pilsner Ground Fund - arrest of police at a public hearing
In the building of the foundation fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police took arrests in recent days.
The so-called media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was kidnapped by the detectives in handcuffs.
This had allegedly attempted to manipulate a newly-present public competition to deal with restitution claims in such a way that the properties offered in the competition would have a concrete interest.
This is what Luboš G. should have paid half a million for.
“At that time, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for the crime of fraudulent machining at a public competition,” said Antonie Zelená, chief of the newspaper’s Pilsner State Attorney of Právo.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released again by the police.
How he could manipulate public competition can only be speculated in the light of the spurious official information.
The spokeswoman of the Lubomír Černá Ground Fund raised the question raised by Právo, the police actually arrested in the Pilsner side of the Ground Fund and this during a public competition.
\"It was about a client and no longer about one of our employees - it was concrete.
The public competition, according to Mrs Černá, had the correct term \"requires to offer claims for the transfer of property according to the ground law\" and would take place in cases where several third-party interest in the property offered would be shown.
“These persons offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be paid by the transfer as part of the request than the declared property value,” he said.
“In accordance with the claims offered, the order of potential buyers is set, after which the Ground Fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer,” explains the Fund’s spokesman.
Luboš G. obviously provided information on who had signed up for the call, and since he was himself a entitled person, since he had bought a number of restitution claims, he offered a real estate interest to withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat removal.
This would also be a sufficient explanation of why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had very good contacts with the Pilsner Ground Fund in the past.
So he also played a role in the Causa of the former Chief of the Václav Sankota Ground Fund, which was criminally persecuted because he issued property in replacement restitutions to which location decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. also acquired land intended for the construction of public roads from the ground fund, more precisely where the construction of the entrance magistrate to the commercial area of Borské pole was planned.
Later he traded these very cheaply with the magistrate against a house directly in the historic centre of the city, which far exceeded the value of the property.
At the time, the town hall had to give a heavy heart so as not to endanger the building site by blocking the property.
The housing costs of households rise by a few hundred months
As of January, households must not only expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also with higher water and wastewater fees and for remote heating and some locations, the rents are also growing.
As of January, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns a month more from the Portuguese than ever before.
Power will be up to 4.6% more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and some places will also consume remote heat supplies.
The housing budgets cost several hundred more crowns each year.
The strong-stream prices have been reduced by all main suppliers, so debt is the significant promotion of electricity production from renewable sources, particularly from photovoltaic plants.
Although gas is only relatively expensive, this is exactly when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, there are a few hundred crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for remote heating are different from city to city.
In particular, larger places plan price increases.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové need to pay up to 50 crowns more from January to January, more than 1000 crowns pay more per year to families in Liberec.
In turn, the inhabitants of Prague threaten 9 percent higher water and waste water fees and this in case the city increases infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague, however, is also one of the lowest compared to all Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and waste water costs are expected to rise by 7.4%.
For example, a standard rental price increase can be expected in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will fall off from January.
For example, the apartment company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in éstí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January.
If anyone disagrees with this increase in rent, he wants the company to have legal interests.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in almost 300,000 apartments today, may rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drinking with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, Rum and Vodka, except for a good whisky, which was stolen from the house bar from the father.
These are the drinks that have to be treated most often after the pleasure of drunk teenagers under fifteen.
No exception are children who need to sleep out at the hospital several times.
This is based on the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the adoption of the child departments of clinics.
“Beers or wine are completely out of fashion because it takes too long for you to be drunk.
“Today’s trend is clearly tough alcohol,” said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the chief physician of the children’s department in the Central Bohemian Hospital Hořovice.
“Whisky, if it is possible to get rid of the father a bottle from the house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or Vodka.
\"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with Juice, then he doesn't smell so strongly,\" explains the chief physician.
The spokeswoman of the Motol Eva Jurinová faculty hospital gave him permission.
“The most common thing is Fernet or Rum.
“This is the current trend of alcohol, particularly in elementary schools.”
“One-on-one was Slibowitz, who was taken from home, led Mrs. Jurinová.
According to Professor Pelikán, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old Trinkers in hospital admission are long-term no exception.
Before the clinic in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked in the Motol Hospital’s Paediatric Department for ten years, where the rescue cars delivered students from near and far.
“A girl had to be hospitalised four times.
“Your career began at the age of 12 when she was given the first time with 3.5 promills of alcohol in the blood and yet, in combination with “extase,” the doctor described a particularly difficult case.
\"She was at the exhibition site in Holešovice at any dance party -
“The interesting thing was that her mother didn’t find it strange that her daughter didn’t come home for 48 hours,” the chief doctor wondered.
Especially the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when starting their own sprayers is considered one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children.
For a real dependence in the true sense of the word, experts do not believe in children.
Under alcoholism, a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all its related phenomena is to be understood, and this is not the case with these children.
In those who enjoy repeated alcohol, usually a negative family-social background is characteristic - explains chief physician Pelikán.
Motol’s spokeswoman, Mrs. Jurinová, was assigned to the so-called Department of Children’s and Youth Medicine by mid-November.
However, only the cases with severe alcohol poisoning that required hospital stay go into the statistics.
Intoxicated children who are brought home by the parents or, if appropriate, by the police after ambulance treatment are not registered.
In addition to the cases in which children only drink a bottle of snapps in the school bank, there are three annual amplitudes, according to Mr Pelikán, on which one hundred percent is left: Walpurgisnacht, Silvester and the end of the school year.
“The last one for two reasons - either for grief because of bad witness or for joy at the holidays”
“On Walpurgi night, I have also experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording,” Dr. Pelikán said.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who has to fight with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning, which come from dehydrate and from glucose deficiency, can be driven in the hospital with a fluid-dependent infusion with glucose and nutrients that lacks the organism.
\"They're clearly better off because after the \"glorious\" experience in the evening, they wake up with a good mood, without hurting somewhere\"
“They’re just a little confused about where they’re,” Dr. Pelikán says, “and he’s losing the good mood to the patients, including at least by counting them the costs they’ll cost the treatment.
Because the transport with the rescue car and the night in an acute bed are good and would like to have a few thousand crowns.
“Then and again, I used this as a means of education when I directly predicted to the children at the visit what their drunkenness cost and that it could happen quite well that they would have to work all the vacation over to earn the money for such a feat,” added Dr. Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not seek regress procedures to demand the costs necessary for the healing of the drunk children of the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged against the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew into the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS settles.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
To date, they have only been seen abroad on maneuvers or flight shows.
This is about the flightable two-seat version L-159T1 operated by the Czech Army.
The other three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
They are currently preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the provider of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over them last week.
When it physically exports the aircraft from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, according to the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
The one-sided fighter aircraft L-159 were again set apart from long-term stored aircraft and this without further deposit and investment on the Ministry’s resort.
“The double-seat L-159T1 were exchanged in the current state and appearance,” said Pejšek, newspaper Právo.
He added that the army will not have to come out without two-seat combat aircraft, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200-million contract on the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seat version with Aero Vodochody in May 2009.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second will take over until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to putting the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of NATO countries.
“In the contract, it is clear and clear that EADS is the carrier of aircraft L-159 and that they are intended to serve as pilots for NATO countries.
“It’s therefore the customer’s business, in what way he realizes the thing,” Pejšek added.
The Economic Journal (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange trade of five L-159 against a transport plane Casa and the purchase of further aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was still approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defense had not issued a tendering procedure, but directly addressed EADS.
The Office of Defense argued that this exchange would support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it only uses 24, the rest wanted to sell them.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft may also have a legal downside.
The European Commission has accused the Ministry of Defence in the European Court of Justice of the European Court of Justice of having to choose the aircraft on the basis of an entire European application and of not having it addressed by a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer display finger than ring finger means a lower risk of getting cancer
Men whose show finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously exposed to a lower risk of getting prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This should be related to the level of male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this is particularly true in men up to sixty-six,” said the study’s co-author, Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University in Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health concerns, Mrs. Eeles added.
During 1994-2009 she and her colleagues in Britain pursued more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants of the study, the point finger was shorter on the right hand than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and display fingers were the same long.
However, in men whose show finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, already in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones that the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer display finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone is just speeding up the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, the leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said he was known to be a fugitive to this study, yet he did not consider the relationship between the finger length and the risk of cancer to be “full of evidence.”
The Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is also under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and roads are mostly fixed snow, the winter servants were many places all night on axle.
The D5 highway between Kilom 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is blocked by a number of accidents from trucks and trucks and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
This said Novinky.CZ of the Dispatcher of the Central Auto Moto Club.
At Kilo 91, a truck crashed, at Kilo 93 two trucks crashed, and in this accident there were injured.
There are also a few cars in the street.
There are also problems with Kilom 185 of the D1 highway towards Prague.
Two trucks have also collapsed here.
The drivers should take off immediately behind Brno at Kilo 190 or drive over Brno and drive up at Kývalka at Kývalka.
This is where a mile of dust is formed.
An accident has also occurred on the D11, and that is the same when travelling to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a several centimeters of thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car colonies form in the district of Prosek, and the street Štěrboholská is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is at least the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Peace Square.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis rod comes together.
There are also problems with the railway and the airport.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven rapid train connections due to snow waverings.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun.
Travelers should be informed of the current situation.
The airport Ruzyně has been closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. until 5 a.m. in the morning.
Most of the roads in South Mora are only accessible with increased caution.
In order to get to Vyškov, three by-roads are completely inhospitable, and in the area of Brno, snow-breathing and in the area of Blansko, you are forced to use snow-fringing on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are three roads still completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
There will also be a need to use snowflakes for snowflakes.
When they become accessible, they can’t be appreciated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is given in the area of white carpaths.
On the roads which are allowed to be scattered only with inert scatterers for natural protection reasons, there is a snow cover of up to five centimeters, according to ČTK.
The Czech Republic fell from two to ten centimeters of new snow, most of which in northern Bohemia - up to 18 centimeters.
In the Märisch-Schlesian region, up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it is slow to snow.
American soldiers have a new “intelligent weapon”
For the first time in Afghanistan, the U.S. troops used a new “intelligent” weapon, known only as XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the relationship of force to their favors.
The new weapon is like a super-accurate cannon.
Your projectiles are targeted by laser with a meeting safety of only a few meters.
The special shots of caliber 25 mm, designed for this gun and containing high-explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The shots can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only at the time of impact on the target but at any point of their ballistic flight.
That is, you can use it against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle - a wall or in the gunfire.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splitter rain from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new weapon of arms is the first infantry weapon to use \"intelligent\" technologies.
“The soldier basically moves on to the target and sends out a laser beam, which determines the distance, so he wins a precise point of view after which he corrects the increase angle, then he only needs to print down.
\"Let's say, you've measured 543 m.
“When you print down, the weapon loads up and shoots the shot at the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs will be reduced
The Fujitsu Group relocates its branch to Frankfurt in Bad Homburg.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their jobs from the former office building at Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu relocates its branch to Frankfurt in Bad Homburg.
As reported on computers and their maintenance specialist industry giants on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their jobs from the former office building at Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term there should be another 100 jobs of the Group that have been distributed to the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and the large-scale offices in the Astro Park are better opposed to employees’ work.
Fujitsu had also been a tenant in Bad Homburg.
The managing director of Bernd Wagner said, “With Frankfurt-Nederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance to a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region called for joy in the winners and disappointment of the losers yesterday.
Frankfurter Wirtschaftdezernent Markus Frank (CDU) said that once again a “Global Player” was won.
This is a ‘great location confession’.
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement being an important incentive for Lower Wheel.
The Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed of the intention by the management early.
“Of course, we offered our help to the company,” Corwisi said.
The friendly contacts, however, could not have changed anything about the computer manufacturer’s difficulties with the owner of the property at the Marienbader Square.
Eventually, economic reasons would have been the result.
Now it’s about preventing a long idleness in such a prominent place.
“I hope that the owner and owner of the building will show cooperation.
The house used by Fujitsu at the Town Hall Square and the neighboring small verticals were one of the most controversial construction sites in the Kurstadt ten years ago, with the rest of the buildings at the Marienbader Square.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city centre was created between the railway station and the town hall, which was critical both because of the massive construction of the areas previously used as a parking lot and because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, then associated with Siemens, covered the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Auern Group, together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and sold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Consummers, located in Tokyo, is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however, much more workers are counting Fujitsu in Munich.
Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Neederrad, is supposed to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
As a result, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-first year of the complex - the name plays on its star-shaped base - the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics has its seat.
Amazon locks server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks are increasingly in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
The political pressure behind this may have been after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange allegedly stops in England.
The Wikileaks disclosure platform is increasingly under attack in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their previous U.S. server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's survey list, is expected to stop following a newspaper report in the UK.
\"Wikileaks displaced by Amazon server\"
“Free speech in the country of the outdoors - the disclosure activists announced by short news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had returned to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when they published the secret diplomatic depees in order to manage the high access numbers to the documents.
By Twitter, Wikileaks continued: \"Prima - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe\"
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, “they should stop selling books”
Amazon stopped the use of its server by Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's staff hired research, the television station CNN reported calling on Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Protection threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British Guard said.
“I wish Amazon had previously taken this measure in view of the previous release of classified information by Wikileaks,” the Senator said.
Lieberman at the same time called on the platform to also deny use to servers in other countries.
\"Wikileaks' illegal, insolent and careless action puts our national security at stake and threatens around the globe life - it was in a statement by the partyless Senator.
\"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to distribute stolen material\"
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is sought by the authorities in Sweden for rape suspects, is on Interpol's list of charges.
According to a report from the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian in the UK, the exact place is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigations in Sweden as an intriguing threat to its opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hafnsson said in London there were threats.
“There was even a call for the murder of Julian Assange.
Therefore, Assange feared for his safety, Haffnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will continue to hide.
Hafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had requested that the responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged and executed for betrayal.
In Canada, an advisor to Chief of Government Stephen Harper - obviously ironically - said on television, Assange should be \"killed\" and Obama could \"use a drone\"
Between the White House and Assange, a stroke broke out.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it “laughing and absurd” that Assange had requested the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for recently announced espionage requests to diplomats.
“I’m not quite sure why we care about a guy’s opinion with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its own website.
The U.S. government now puts the protection of its databases to the test level.
As a special officer, the Vice Director of the Center for Anti-Terror Events, Russell Travers, announced the White House.
Travers is responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that became necessary after the disclosure of the news reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to check the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that it would want to ensure the safety of dissidents and the most active should be threatened by the Wikileaks publication.
“We’ve done everything we can to get in touch with them,” said Philip Crowley.
“We are ready to protect them when it is necessary.”
The Ice University
At Gelato University at Bologna, ice conditioners will be prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatries has the largest inflow and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice come from?
by Gelatare and Gelataio.
The gelatire, in German something old-fashioned by the ice conditioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice making art.
The gelataio picks the ice cream from the refrigerator with a spachel, puts it into the gun and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about ice, he doesn’t go to the “Gelato University” of Carpigiani Italian company.
The Eis-Universität has established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines can meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future gelatries has the largest inflow and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate neis and internships in the house-owned ice parts.
Some dream of a new career in the Midlife Crisis, others simply venture on the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a company consultant, and after years in a nervous job, wants to do something for herself.
Two young Egyptians dreamed of opening an iceberg in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro scholar Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Not only is it good taste, but it is also the good taste and the good consistency.
Luciano also forgets in his training, but also not the snout of national and even southern overbuilding: \"Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance in it.\"
The first step in manufacturing seems very simple.
Luciano drops the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixing device that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns up on the machine and comes out with a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all kinds of dairy.
Immediately, the lecturer will be bombarded with questions: Can ice cream only be produced with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let your own experimenting desire run freely?
Luciano warns against being led by the contemporary spirit into error.
Those who speak of ice cream — from natural ingredients — may still have used stabilizers — usually a natural product, such as guar core flour from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also produce ice without a stabilizer, only then it needs to be sold within a day, otherwise it sucks together, and the customer bites on loud icecorns.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano differs between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
“The suppliers will all try to turn you dozens of aromatized additions”
“But you should simply experiment.”
Either in the fruit-sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even in the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder for all possible chocolate temptations.
Now the course participants are allowed to join the ice machines.
Luciano can each produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mokka and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also followed by the fruit ice varieties.
More flavours, more fruit-purity - tasteful this is not necessarily better.
Hazelnus ice does not necessarily taste more useful if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice produces the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture accurately highlights the taste of a gelato, Luciano says.
Ice production is a calculation task: If Pfirsich-Puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extra serving of sugar is necessary for lemon ice.
Luciano draws out a device by which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winners thus measure the oechs in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate computer engineering.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical use as before.
Not only does the device help for the automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is beaten at the same time creamy and cooled to Minus temperatures.
All automation, despite the fact that small panels do not remain.
Brasilian Gustavo and his coursemates dressed up from top to bottom with fruit purée, when the super-dimensional dust mixer was out of control.
“In every course, Maestro says Luciano, it’s just a question of time until something like this happens.”
Controls in the two-light
The European Food Authority Efsa is subsidized by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
This charge now forms the expert group of test biotech, which is understood as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we’ve documented it well,” said Testbiotech chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the Ilsi lobbyist association for years.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has worked closely with the Efsa test rules for gene plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, then criticized.
The Efsa rules are in full agreement with the Ilsi position papers and therefore carry out the handwriting of the industry, which is to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that Test Biotech has been considering a class of interest.
Thus, a high-ranking Efsa manager is relatively young without any changes or transition time to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and has changed the pages.
The Central German Broadcasting (MDR) also recently revealed links between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobbys, which made the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU parliamentarians clear.
The Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
It is based on all serious data, including those of industry, as long as they are of high quality, it is said in an opinion.
Of the experts working for Efsa, it was not required that they have no contacts with the industry.
But they had to reveal them.
Kuiper holds his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This itself is called a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics, among other things, for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the matter, independent experts like then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently approved without any feeding test in animals and that the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
“We want to know, for example, what makes genetically modified corn on the crop,” says Then.
At present, it is practice to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which did not deliver reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how to find them,” he asks.
Angelika Hilbeck sees this as well.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technische Hochschule Zürich.
In this field, as in the United States, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
There are, therefore, few researchers who are not involved with corporations.
Critical studies would not usually be published for companies.
“The industry controls security research,” says Hilbeck.
The Trail of Stones
Uli Gsell also has any concerns, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in the form of Stuttgart railway station, the Tuba on the back.
It was demo.
It snowed.
The story is well known: In September the baggers were grabbed and had begun to break down a large piece of the North wing.
The Stuttgart World was no longer the same: Zig thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-thousand deep-seated station.
When it came to the construction stop, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft rough stone built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He secured some of the brokers.
“These stones are relics.
“You must not disappear.”
He swears: \"A cheaper and poor stone, simple and earthy -
When he said one, he smelled at the cigarette qualm.
What he's going to do with the brokers, he doesn't yet know.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgart Stones leads to a forest at Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old acts with old stones.
He bought all those who found themselves in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame to have them milled to a shooter or disappear in the depot,” he says in his office, a wooden store that was once a guardhouse.
When he was in the newspapers in September, he was told that he had bought the rest of the North wing from the canceler.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he can't do anything for the breakup.
And if it ever happened, then it would be the most reasonable if the stones would continue to be used.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the quadrants, a piece price of 6,50 to 14 euros, which was heavy over 80 kilos.
As a reminder, some but also in the hope of being able to return it during a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck charges.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, housing farmers.
From everywhere they came and had tossed away, which could carry suitcases and trailers.
The Stuttgart stones of the instigation have long been transformed into “mowers” or limited to herbs.
“In fact, this stone is nothing special,” says Rongen.
“We are not the political component.
He climbs into his terrain car, making a tour through his 20-hectare kingdom.
Jura has studied and broken down, later biology, then he has been interested in computers and has eventually become a stone merchant.
And stone lover.
40000 tons of stones are stored.
From all over Germany, he brings together his treasures.
He says he is the largest stone merchant in the Republic.
He's brake.
In the snow there are artificially enchanted sandstones.
“They once belonged to the Dresdner Marienbrücke,” he said.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he swims.
“My favorite stone
It goes the way up through the forest.
He points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And on.
\"Dear Travertin \"
The quadruples were once part of the tribune of the Stuttgarter Neckarstadions.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from the Cathedral of Saint Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbroner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones were used to be hand-kept and moved with simple bottles and oxcarts, he becomes very fear-inspiring.
“It would be a scandal if you were to scrutinize something like that.”
He has not become rich, he has not even been stoned.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, as well as on top of the forest Steinmetze, a sculptor, asmith, a glass blower and a gardener.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the resuscitator.
First, he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent struggle for high-potentials
There is a heavy rain at the Buffet.
16 students are forced to laugh, tomatoes, and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of competition of ideas, they are to work together with VW developers to learn about the car of the future - and to get to know it right next to Volkswagen.
In the competition for the smartest heads, many companies are now in the near battle and, like VW, are putting on collaborations with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the gifted graduates as early as possible in the hearing rooms before they come to the labour market and are reassigned by others.
And because the universities do not issue essays on the performance of their students, they try to test and bind the exceptional talents in practice projects.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car company will focus on the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ballwriters, rubber boots and maps with VW logo.
It tells the hopeful young talent of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig maintains the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: “The students are coming into contact with industry and collecting experience.”
“VW can get to know students at the same time, be more interested in interested candidates and think about who is getting into question as an employee.”
Such cooperation, according to cells, is not uncommon.
It’s not so obvious that the students are being bullied.
“Sometimes the focus was on the professional project,” says Selle.
The struggle for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many industries, the companies can no longer select their employees from a large range of applicants.
In addition, they have to pay attention to themselves and particularly to highly qualified employers.
In particular, graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent position of negotiation.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap is getting even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
Roman Dykta goes on talent hunting for the economic inspection and consulting company KPMG.
It organizes elaborate recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern cutting-edge hunt where participants need to find their way through GPS terminals.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the U.S. in the next year.
In addition, participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Anyone who is allowed to decide in two rounds in advance.
Only the Auer de la Revue of the many applicants flies to the United States.
The protections, according to Dykta, are getting bigger when hooving and stabbing around the high potentials at the universities.
“We want to lift ourselves out of the crowd with the race.”
“Only a simple sailing session was too little for us.”
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to be going up.
“We’ve been in contact with all participants of a similar action in the last year,” he said.
“Some are just before their graduation and want to apply for us soon,” he says.
In addition to direct bushing at campus, small and medium-sized companies are also very classical at professional fairs at Pirsch.
“We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs.
“Etwa on the Intersolar” reports Sitha Stübe, staff leader at Solar Technology Manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
He knows the problem of growing up.
Currently, 35 positions are posted on the company website.
“It’s very difficult to occupy vacancy positions.”
“It takes a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is contact with the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University in Freiberg.
“The professors give evidence that we can do internships or write our diplomas,” he said.
There are no promotions to the solar specialist.
For this purpose, the company tries to advertise with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
“That can’t often be a big group,” says staff leader Stübe.
In the long run, the job search no longer plays the main role.
Flexible working hours, child care or good climbing opportunities are other crucial factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld placed 55th among Germany’s 100 best employers.
The institute creates an annual best list of German employers.
For this purpose, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and job environment and looks at the frameworks for employees.
Staff leader Stübe also hopes to place additional points with the job seekers.
“I think applicants look particularly at external reviews about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers on more authenticity.
And that means, according to warrior, especially internal measures.
“The best way to be attractive as an employer is through their own employees,” he says.
In the industry, the internal employer branding is called Employer Branding, i.e. employer branding within their own workforce.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, then they would be advertising to friends and acquaintances for their employer by themselves.
“This is like a game with bands,” says Krieger.
Obama Stops New Oil Drills
On the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil bores in the coming years.
An appropriate ban has been adopted by the government in Washington - and thus finally withdrawing their previous plans.
New bores are also first forbidden off the Atlantic coast.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban to apply at least for the next five years is the explosion of the \"Deepwater Horizon\" drill platform in April.
Before the accident that took 11 workers to life and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his willingness to allow new bores in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico on pressure from the opposition and industry.
The advocates therefore want to reduce the dependence of the US on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who bear the responsibility for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf are not finally cleared up to this day.
At the center of criticism is the UK energy company BP, which is faced with billions of demands.
An investigation commission on Obama's behalf will present its results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar had lifted the drill stop imposed after the explosion.
After that, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling products.
With sharper controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been in charge of numerous corruption allegations, will be fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced that it will close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry now warns publicly that the amount of funding in the Gulf would be significantly lower by stricter regulation than previously.
“The government’s plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industry — the result of a current industry survey by the consulting firm BDO — even before Wednesday’s drill ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows what’s going to change with the regulation.
Investments in new funding projects would continue to be up-to-date - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of crude oil has destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live by theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari says well.
\"Don't bother yourself - the eco-activist calms the journalists, \"You'll still get enough oil mud in front of the lens today.\"
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to lighten a boy to the chest in the water with the mussels surrounding him: in the rainbow-colored water shine, the scene is almost pretty beautiful.
That under the surface brown crude oil swathes are floating, is not to be seen.
In the past, she had collected shrimp here, telling Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo Jetty River.
In the meantime, the water that is flowing is completely dead.
Five years ago, a bristle pipeline produced unadulterated crude oil into the huge moisture area.
Fishers from the nearby village of Bodo now have to row for six hours in order to get into fish-containing waters: the Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the world’s worst devastated regions.
On the journey through the mangrove sums passed by rivers, the entire extent of destruction becomes obvious.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat cools brown brews, who dives his hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees, like black lacritic poles from the ground, are saddened by the unique palms that hang their weeds.
Bird heat, as they are otherwise common in wet areas, is sought for in vain: once the outer board is quiet, it expands into the former paradise of Spenstic Peace like a gas station.
“What happens here is ecological warfare,” says Celestine Akpobari window, “we live in constant danger to health.”
The comparison of war is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a battleground for decades: over 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe, organized here in the 80s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, had to set up its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company has been denied its return to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped from the entire Delta region from the triple size of Switzerland with over 5000 bore wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines every day, the oil fields in Ogoniland are too unstable for the group.
All the hundreds of meters of steel pieces such as bizarre sculptures from the water: “Christbäumchen” are much too tenderly called the heads of the drill holes.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the mark.
Again and again, such a drill head breaks apart, Akpobari says, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
More than two billion liters have been added to the Delta ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: year after year the amount of oil, as in the Havaria of the Supertanker, Exxon Valdez - forced into the sea 21 years ago before Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in mankind’s history.
Anyone who is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU will argue about it.
During the Shell Group Sabotage and organized oil theft account for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see breezing drillheads and leaked pipelines as main causers.
Shell lays down significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than otherwise in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner accused the Group in 2008: Only the rate of defects in the lines is “a multiple higher than elsewhere”
In a place that looks like a abandoned, oil-damaged workshop under free sky, it appears from the mangroves forms: they are split-packed and oiled to the neck.
Among one of the many barrels, which are partly connected to tubes, partly randomly scattered on the ground, a fire flashes: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the receiving pot, then later drops out at the end of the line of kerosine and finally diesel.
This is how Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel, 300 liters daily: “This brings us 34,000 naira — around $22.
Delta residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The low diesel price with almost 40 Euro cents per litre can still lower illegal cooks: because their raw materials get them out of the way.
It comes from bunkers that attack the pipeline network across Ogoniland: in this way, according to experts throughout the Niger Delta, at least 16 million litres of crude oil are lost daily.
However, only a small part of the provisionally interred raw material is illegally destroyed: the lion’s share of organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military forces, is filled in tank ships and scorched on the world market.
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is more at fault with the displacement of the population or the lax production method, considers activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
“If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and had not so thoroughly destroyed the life base of fishermen, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refinery.
In the meantime, however, the Ogoni's relationship was mainly to Shell, so destroyed that only one withdrawal of the group could be questioned: \"Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese are more likely to come out than better,\" he said.
Michael becomes nervous.
\"Highest time you're disappearing,\" says the musculoskeletal oilman.
\"Every minute the soldiers can come.\"
If the illegal oil processors are caught by the special unit of armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but are likely to have a painful lubrication.
The soldiers, like all Nigerians, want to benefit from the raw materials, mainly from the country order.
“This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way,” Akpobari says.
Researchers discover dangerous construction errors in A380 drives
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Researchers have discovered a possible failure in the investigation of an emergency-landed machine, which can lead to a “catasmal driver failure.”
The Qantas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the needy Qantas airbus in early November apparently had much more luck than previously known: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in its investigations with the drives of some A380 machines - and now warns of a possible construction failure.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: an oil hose compound could produce fatigue and leaks, according to an opinion published on Thursday by the Authority ATSB.
This could have led to a disastrous crash.
It was affected by Rolls-Royce-produced drives in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
The Qantas airbus is located below, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now launched legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a complaint with an Australian federal court in Sydney that would allow him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief Alan Joyce said his airline will require damages for the incident in early November.
When the engine was burned, parts had been dissolved and the support surfaces damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as a cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 drives must now be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that further safety tests were being carried out at the Superjumbos, which are equipped with the affected drives.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security problem has been considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its 11 A380s on the ground.
In the case of an A380, the Lufthansa changed the drive at a caution measure.
The double-storey pilot is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Land-wide snowfall causes traffic chaos
Germany entirely in White: Overnight, snow fell almost all over the country.
There are chaos, trains and flights on many roads.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter frosts Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the entire Republic is cut to Thursday during the night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and in the east, there are some 15 centimeters of thick snow cover.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely limited.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the winter service was in permanent use, but was not completed with the constantly resilient snow.
In addition, violent trees fought across the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime and Hydrography (BSH) expects to be located on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning of storm floods with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal level.
In Saxony, the snow wave on the highways and federal roads led to significant problems.
According to the Meteomedia, in Saxon Switzerland, the highest level of alarm was violet - the highest level at all.
In some cases, 30 centimeters of new snow, fresh and strong winds caused confusion.
There, several trucks and cars stayed at night.
Even in Sachsen-Anhalt, police authorities reported major disruptions on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to stocking traffic and dust.
The snowfalls affected A4 and A9 in Thuringia.
According to Deutscher Bahn, in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in the north of Bavaria, there are significant disruptions.
Snow on the tracks, collapsed trees on the rails or destroyed lines and softs are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE to Munich had to stop its journey.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescuers with wool covers, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds fought across the streets.
At large German airports, snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
According to a spokesperson for the flight information center, a number of cancellations have already been reported in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, a Fraport spokeswoman has already caught 40 flights.
Winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers are at the airport, they still have almost 400 field beds for them.
On many roads, there were accidents on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed by a train on a train crossing to Eastholstein.
The locker was easily injured.
Near Nuremberg, due to snow-covered roads, there was a similar accident: also here a truck was caught on a railway crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after crossing her car at Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
However, the meteorologists have a good message: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will already be winding up with light trees.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is home to fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for their twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Money House seeks buyers for the two office towers at their Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could bring the property in.
At first, the German Bank has made its headquarters very popular: the twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now, the financial firm is apparently trying to recover the cost of the renovation, and is looking for a buyer for the two high houses, as the “Financial Times Germany” writes in a call to a spokesman.
Reasons for the planned sale did not mention the speaker.
“We always check if it makes sense to own or sell real estate itself and then rent it back,” he said.
Germany’s largest credit institution has been relocating its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had only acquired the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of a home fund and subsequently renovated.
Energetic conversions amounted to around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the newspaper’s “Greentowers” now renamed towers to around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are once again sold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, is currently open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourning the dead
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the spilled miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still, the bodies could not be secured because the safety situation in the accident shaft is still more precise.
Just two weeks ago, in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth, it was a violent explosion.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were scattered under days.
A probe had been dropped in the accident shaft, but had not discovered a trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue forces were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, authorities and experts assumed that there was no more chance of survival for the complex.
The bodies could not be saved so far.
Members and friends now remember the dead with a memorial.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in the New Zealand South Island on the bright sunlight in Greymouth.
For two minutes, they're silent.
In honor of the layered miners, 29 tables were set up, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the chapel were seen.
Pictures and personal items, including clothes and surfboards, also took place here.
Before the country's government buildings, the flags were half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface from the depths of the earth, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said to the Memorial participants.
“But they never came home.”
He cannot end with the death of his son, unless he has seen his body, Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was thrown into the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the Memorial celebration.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also scattered.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are pushed down, it will begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, said Police President Gary Knowles to journalists.
To Hell, Warrior!
Does Splatter fit into the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn re-releases old genre boundaries with his fighter-epos “Walhalla Rising”.
What audience might Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he ran “Walhalla Rising”?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and, with almost superhuman forces, repeatedly surrounds his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, just because our hero likes to serve rabbiic killing methods and has already pulled his enemies out of the living body when he has bad mood.
On the other hand, what he is actually called, says the whole film about no word, and also the other characters can be most often pulled to one or two sets or a few quaint screams of death.
Otherwise, it is swiveled and swiveled in Scotland’s magnificent hilly landscape, which the Viking world of about a thousand years ago offers the setting.
Ideal for adult cineasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Beautiful if a movie has several target groups, only if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylized drug dealer trilogy, but he refuses to make his works with a little more humor to the mainstream or somewhat less brutality to the arthouse.
Most of the art cinema friends may be frightened by the injecting brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans die at some point before longing, when, for reasons of freely interpretable reason, a group of violent Christian missionaries broke up by ship to Jerusalem and trapped an eternity in flat and fog before the team apparently arrived in America and continued to silence there.
No wonder “Walhalla Rising” has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is particularly sad because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-drying façade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that has earned some attention.
In this film, it’s not about dialogue or a stringed action, it’s all atmosphere, a film-worded fiebertroom.
And from that there is no entanglement for the viewer.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation, and with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack he slowly adds the throat to it, but above all with the indescribable hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blond boy, who is faithful to the side, keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Most of the single hero, whose motives are never explained, who becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly to the messenger of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps also for those who are no longer dead.
\"Walhalla Rising - is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired for anger, excitement and wonder.
An Experience.
Consistent Earthwork
The nuclear energy authority IAEA has new references to a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country, however, is reluctant to take the position for it, nor does it allow control.
By midnight from 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft were attacking a mysterious, throwing-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents by the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria has allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a valley that goes off the current.
According to a U.S. Foreign Secret Service briefing from the end of April 2008, it would have been well suited to produce plutonium even under the name of the nearby El-Kibar locality, from which nuclear weapons were built.
On the other hand, technology from the 1950s is hardly possible for other purposes.
The CIA introduced a video presentation with undamaged satellite images.
By computer animation, it identified which components of the reactor should have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos showing the building from the vicinity or even the interior.
The reactor had been in operation shortly before, it was called, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, little more is known than then, yes, the puzzles have become bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly saw evidence that there was \"an active nuclear weapons program\" in the country.
Some secret servants in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a “provided reactor” — even if they consider the CIA presentation to be “plausible.”
They lack hard evidence, as do the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat answered only lapidar in summer, which IAEA has \"enough material to ask questions\"
Although the shooting of the alleged “unused military building,” the Syrians created part of it and planned the site thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinone found in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by people.
In addition, through a Member State, IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers from time to time immediately after the attack that might be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - has bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always dared never to run a secret nuclear program or build a reactor.
The uranium was from the Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, the IAEA, after analysis of the particles, was unlikely to return.
Damascus has since refused to discuss it - just like the satellite images.
In addition, it protects the control hours from a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
“We will never comment on this,” said Ehud Olmert, the official position of Prime Minister at the time of the attack.
The case’s investigation since June 2008 has been unsuccessful, and — increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority — such as a high Western diplomat at the seat of the IAEA in Vienna — is ultimately a serious violation of the nuclear-weapons barrier contract in the area over which the IAEA is waiting.
The IAEA sees as the key to progress in the enlightenment of the IAEA three other facilities that are \"in a functional connection - with the supposed reactor - and are different from the one that still exists.
So far, the inspectors have not revealed what plants it is or what function it has or what makes it appear suspicious.
According to information from the South German newspaper, they are referred to internally at the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these sites and has found out on satellite images a building complex at Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military terminal - just with this reasoning, Syria of the IAEA rejects access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the United States to expropriate military facilities.
The nuclear detectives have become aware of the facilities by a tip of the US secret services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photographs that material was transported back and forth between the three locations and the quadder at the Euphrates.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could be in connection with fuel production.
However, there is no indication of sensitive activities, i.e. uranium enriching or reworking; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where later the plutonium should be separated for the bomb, these central questions are at least plausible.
It is also unclear whether debris, which could store valuable traces, were stored in the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truck loads disappeared from the ground floor, no one wants information about where the gun was left.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria examined for its effectiveness in 1998 as a camp for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely to be the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently brought her into contact with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, recordings from the orbit show that Syria was doing earthwork in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but has hardly helped to eliminate the suspicion.
In addition, in diplomat circles, the IAEA has used several months to develop a plan for inspections there that would allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - only the effort shows how great the interest of inspectors is.
Indes, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
Had western diplomats in Vienna still emphasised a year ago that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter has no high urgency, bringing about US ambassador Glyn Davies to play so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the sharpest means that the Vienna nuclear authority has to carry out controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who had to suggest these inspections, has already spoken of “an option for which I am open in the future, but is still reluctant.
There is a high risk in this way: for one thing, it requires a majority in the IAEA Governorate, and several of the 35 countries represented there are anything but painstakingly on an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat thinks: “What if they find nothing in the end?”
Love in the Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still unnamed directorial debut in the summer, there is a problem.
The screenplay she wrote herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but that's enough for unrest.
The rumour, the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavian war.
Bosnian women's associations protested immediately, after which some of Sarajevo's scheduled turnouts were moved to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about UNHCR refugee aid plant to Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself an ambassador to the UN refugee aid plant.
Diplomatically, she is not - she once offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but she refused.
The meeting had to be held in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
Love stories in rape camps did not exist, and Jolies' attitude toward the victims betrayed her enough about the screenplay.
According to the UN refugee aid work, her organization has recommended that Jolie be released as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got her screenplay, has given a turning permit for Sarajevo after some time - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author herself considers that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked with much effort in the Yugoslavian conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all involved sides.
However, the content remains vague.
A second synopsis to the movie on the network, which then sounds quite different: the loved ones knew about it before war broke out and met again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, was dragged into a Serbian camp, where she works as a watch.
What sounds significantly different from the variant “Racism Victims Clashed in Torture Knecht”
The fact that Jolies film actually starts before the war - so much is sure.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is “unfair and based on misinformation”
Now you can only get the hackers of Hollywood peace: by putting the screen, as so many before, illegally into the network.
Nothing as far away here.
Finally, this evening it will be around for the Irish again.
No trace of suspicion.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans rejoiced at the sound of loud music, and they stooped with their feet.
The Bailey pub in the Southern Irish Cork is rocking because players throw table tennis balls over a three-metre period in beer cup - and meet.
“Bierpong” is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 euros of victory premiums plus tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this scrupulous drinking game and the restraining computer scientist that doesn’t really fit together.
And yet, the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself to distract himself from the boring question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not playing fun in Las Vegas, he will conduct application talks in New Zealand in January.
“I have a lot of sense in it,” he says.
“It’s so far away from home and I still don’t have a job there.”
After all, his girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland — “she had ruck, sucked her wish job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign — says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor perspectives at home, two of Tanners have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a position as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the dancers, it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, according to experts from the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin.
By 2015, they were even expecting 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a huge loss.
True to the predictions, there is a wave of migration comparable to that of Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of the upsurge, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, Tristes is now again widening.
The economic crisis is particularly insecure to the young, well-trained Irish, for which it has only gone up to date.
Job loss and social decline seem absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was used, money was in abundance.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times, there are letters of readers of young immigrants complaining: “Everything goes down the Bach in Ireland.”
\"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation.\"
“The last one, please, is the light.”
Jura student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future as the government only practices eye-wisdom and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
“They reduce the minimum wages, but they don’t have a strategy to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
They observe how their comilitons hang from an unpaid practice to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is to have to move out in four years.
“This thought is sad and depressing.
In doing so, men like Stephen McLarnon try to positively occupy the subject.
McLarnon organizes the “WorkingAbroadExpo” trade fair, which offers a round-the-clock service to work abroad.
“For professionals, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career leader,” says the manager.
On its website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are just raising a fashion house.
In January, it continues to go to Hanover or Berlin, the next project.
His home now only rarely sees O'Donovan, because he makes extra layers to pay off the credit for his home.
“The situation is already a bit crazy,” he says, when after a long time he steps over the threshold of his house.
“I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I’m as good as never again.”
He laughs a little low and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in which entrances parks large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros four years ago - 100 percent credit.
“There were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions,” he says.
Is he afraid that it might go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan ponders for a while, gives up hot tea and says, \"I don't have any children I have to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start new.\"
The construction engineer does not like the crying he is currently hearing often.
“No one needs to starve - our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in the past on the island,” he says.
\"For a while working abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we feel like Irish.\"
He laughs and then tells about his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
“After seven years he was back there and life continued in Ireland, quite simply.
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just look at how it works with life somewhere else.
A few years of work in London he has already been behind himself, and why shouldn’t it also run well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
One thing is still there, however, that concerns him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it might be part of a well-being party.
“Don’t hurt too many emotions,” he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
“Well done, that sounds scary.”
\"We prefer to call it a away party, quite loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games.\"
The Democratic Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These results included the Latinobarómetro survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts in this year’s survey from September and October are particularly in focus.
First of all, the good mood in Latin America
And second, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased greatly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democratic advocates rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong collapse last year, such a trend is to be recognized.
However, only half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the most densely populated countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see diagram 2).
About 44% of respondents said they are satisfied with their country’s democratic practice, which is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crisis undermined efforts for more democracy.
This continued during the global economic crisis, perhaps because the countries of Latin America experienced only a short recession phase and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(Such reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week increased the poverty rate in Latin America in 2009 and fell again by 32% this year.)
But from country to country, there are strong mood differences (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and popularity of the separable President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread preoccupation.
In Mexico and Central America, where recession was more sensitive and violence has increased, this is less the case.
For the first time since the beginning of the survey, many respondents in Latin America in their country see a greater problem than in unemployment (see diagram 5).
About 31% say that either they or a family member have been victims of a crime last year, but compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
Increased economic performance is reflected in the increased support of the private and market economy: about 71% of those surveyed over-regionally indicated that the private economy is indispensable for development; in 2007, 56% (see diagram 6).
About 58% declared that only the market economy of their country can make progress, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of those surveyed in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, states many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
The surveyers in Mexico and most countries in Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, taking this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
The Battle of the Electorate
No one expected the elections to be perfect on November 28 in Haiti.
But the facts surpassed the fears of the electors who rushed to help the country.
Overcrowded ballots, multiple cast votes, ballots in the Rinstein, destroyed electoral sites, and horrors were only part of the problems.
Electoral locations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the January earthquake, were searching for a choice.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged top riders, requested the withdrawal of election results due to an alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election “as quite good in many interests.”
According to a careful statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, these irregularities, as serious as they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process.
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is alleged to be committed to the unpopular divorced President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected pick-up will be available for January.
There is hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first-lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity complaint.
If Jude Célestin, who finds only minor or no consent to the electorate, declared the electorate to be the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims are still living in tents, a low election was feared.
On the day of the election, many Haitians were prevented from voting by lack of organization.
Just before the start of the election, about 250,000 tickets required for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot on the game.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognized government an important step in rebuilding Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Home to the center
In the weeks following the sudden death of your husband, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, learned a wave of sympathy that pushed their popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%, which is the highest value since their election in 2007.
However, whether this is helping you to re-election next year depends on whether the seemingly grieving Cristina Fernández is more compatible than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also guided economic policy after his wife's election, often presented budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the couple of presidents to spend the extra income on their own well-dwelling.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Church's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further destructions.
Some regime critics from the ranks of reigning peronists were behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where one parliamentarian was facing another and the government of bribery) Congress failed to adopt the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to discuss it,” she said.
The 2010 budget also applies to the next year, which gives the president even more opportunity to spend money on his own well-dwelling.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
For example, the official inflation rate is 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage requirements of the unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty relief to be his main targets, not the increase in inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, signed the private sector, and cleansed the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which subsequently beautifully praised the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate route?
She called on the private economy and the trade union leaders to talk.
And according to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
Inflation, however, undermined growth by a major reduction in 2002.
Cristina Fernández may want to join the rest of the world financially for this reason.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders that had rejected the country’s previous debt in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The churchmen had always refused a check by the IMF, as elsewhere usual.
However, last month, economic minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide \"technical support\" in creating a new national consumer price index, which seems to be the first step towards cleansing the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even after the end of her term without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle layer, most of which has enough of the churchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that has been brought to her will have been detonated.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether she will stop many political decisions of her husband silently and silently.
Swallows for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother beyond the seas?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all electors, stood up to elect mayors and city councils in the five districts of the city, which is valued as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
By establishing groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma herself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
I've had the test, but it's not enough.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) placed three of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which advocates a greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the town council together with the KMT.
During the election, it came to the common events in Taiwan such as truck convoys with Krawall makers, flag-swiveling mass shifts and only casually dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT held a speech on the eve of the election on a KMT candidate,
When a man shot him out of the crowd, the line was wounded and a surrounding spectator killed.
It is not clear whether the gunman wanted to kill line or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of that, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP has influenced the election and the DPP has turned into a bad light, which gave the KM more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Notably, relations with mainland were not the subject.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love their factual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing ahead.
This time, however, the DPP also avoids exasperating the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy can’t survive without China.
However, the majority of Taiwanese people want to confirm their China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of relocating Taiwan with economic incentives to the Community.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit meeting on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration, but the most important first.
It is better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he won a victory for absolute independence.
However, under Tai’s regentship, a new generation of friendly politicians developed and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and the youth.
Tsai as Presidential candidate of the DPP found great approval, such as Su Tseng-chang among Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she is also able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea forge as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this does require prejudicial discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that their party offers a “trustworthy alternative” to Mas forward approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he explained that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to remain in Taiwan’s independence.
He even urged the Pragmatic Su to reject the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is hard to choose its potential candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularness seem to be unemployment and the continued squeezing between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan supports a re-appropriation only limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese view economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “there is no back anymore.”
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer category of the year
When you appear at the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the ceremony on the occasion of the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony, and now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has been a celebrated star since her 2008 album “Esperanza” in the jazz scene, the nomination seems a little unusual, but it corresponds to the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released at least three albums before the album was released.
Her ambitious 2010 album, \"Chamber Music Society\" is certainly a step forward. And with its strong voice and a good feeling for pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can be compared quietly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 comes next as a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination splits.
In addition, the album “History” was nominated by the Vijay Iyer Trios in the Instrumental Albums category. This lover of critics experienced a huge success.
“Moody 4B” includes James Moody’s experienced saxophonist and “Positootly” keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rough favourite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's \"Treme\" was awarded in the category Contemporary Jazz, in which other albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Societ of Wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-earned attention in the category of the large group, thus joining the Billy Child's Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octett, whose life-ablum \"Pathways\" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's \"Deux Ex Machina\" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's \"Dreamhouse\" is an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 - Los Angeles - This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and launched in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classic albums are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concert Building Orchestra; Daugherty's \"Deus Ex Machina\" and \"Metropolis Symphony\" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's \"Dreamhouse\" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy vocals; \"Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati\" presented by various artists; and Verdi's \"Requiem\" by the Chicago Symphony Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Bergs-Lulu was nominated by the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses-Marc Antonio e Cleopatra - by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos-L'Amour de Loin - by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins - The Enchanted Wanderer - by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivans-Ivanhoe - by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for \"Deus Ex Machina - Hans Werner Henze for \"Appassionatamente Plus - Magnus Lindberg for \"Graffiti - and Shchedrin for \"The Enchanted Wanderer\" - for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was launched and recorded at the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonics led by Esa-Pekka Salonen on January 4.
The 30-minute piece bears the title “Los Angeles” and is named after former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who sits in Russia in prison.
Dorman's \"Mondoline Concert\" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with Orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
“I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestral performance for recording the works of Strawinskis with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his leadership.
As instrumental soloists, the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the opponent Julia Fischer and the harpinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
As vocal soloists, only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Kuchex and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording \"Roots - My Life, My Song\".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula took place after a five-hour, often hot public hearing, the unanimous promise of the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre meets the local provisions and will become an aesthetic catch of sight.
\"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others - said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
“As Americans make me proud.”
“It shows that justice reigns.”
“There are only a few opponents,” he added.
“They’re just very loud.”
“In this valley, wonderful people live.
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost until midnight, with the votes distributed fairly evenly on both sides according to press-enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
“There’s no more America, there’s a comment.
“It is another planet of monkeys, and the statue of freedom is dead in the sand.
\"America is at the end of
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for nonviolence.
His community with about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the warehouse they had rented along with a water filter plant manufacturer.
The new, about 2,300 m2 large Mediterranean-style mosque should have two minarettes and be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Enemies can still challenge the project at the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could allow for new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign type of bacteria that can live, among other things, from arsenic, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is in their view that a life is possible even without the elements that have previously been considered necessary.
“This organism has two possibilities.
\"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic.\"
“This makes it very special, although it’s almost a kind of ‘foreign’ life-form,” said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appeared on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
To date, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as scientists found out, the bacteria in California’s Mono Lake will continue to grow even if it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
“There is a question of what else is possible,” said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, so it is.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were announced about the discovery, gave occasion for widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act from the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery “shows that in other planetary systems organisms, using other elements, biochemical processes, and that the ‘standard elements’, which are absolutely vital in our view, are not necessarily fixedly defined,” said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
“This work is a novum because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another,” added Cockell.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenal.
Since arsenals and phosphorus are the same, they assumed that microbes that are both exposed may replace one element with the other.
“The poison of the arsenic is mainly based on the fact that it behaves in a chemically similar way to phosphorus.”
“This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another.”
“But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently from phosphorus. It gets into our biochemical system, where it narrows almost everything,” Anbar explains.
The researchers exposed the GFAJ-1 bacteria to an increasing arsenal concentration. It adapted and grew.
The microbe grows better in phosphorus, but it can also survive in arsenic, showing that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but there has been no working example yet.
Arsen was more common in the early years of the earth, she says, so science has assumed that early forms of life have used it.
“This gives reason for the assumption that life can also have evolved differently from in the early age of the earth,” says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research work was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's statement of Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs — two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis — disappeared on Tuesday, when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6, the authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, explained.
“The good news is: the dogs are well-off,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
“They were returned to their lawful owners.”
Whitmore did not make any accurate information about the dog’s location nor about the circumstances that led to their discovery.
“The investigation is still ongoing,
“We don’t want to say that anymore,” Whitmore explains.
“We’re going to follow a few tracks.
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
She received her two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district animal home in Downey.
Representatives of the Sheriff found the delivery car and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old horse, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unharmed according to authority statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were on this weekend due to the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city because Trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions in the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
You will often stay in Motels and park your delivery car in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer welder, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with them in their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis stayed in the delivery car because it was cooler there.
They left the window a gap wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek promised everyone who could give a clue to the Corgis a finder’s wage, and the animals were implanted in microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether a finder’s pay would be paid.
The lion rebuffs after court approval of the MGM amendment
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally received green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New-Yorker bankruptcy judge signed the “prepared” bid plan to raise the debt of $5 billion, and to help the 86-year-old entertainment company pave the way for new films and television shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founder of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the process.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 is in effect only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a $500 million loan to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself brings in $75 million, leads the company, and the funding will stand by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the assignment to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the company management who struggled with interest payments of $300 million per year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to solve the financial concerns of MGMs and pay out the more than 140 lubes of the studio took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to offer the company for sale at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted only a few bids and none wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started from the beginning, when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived bankruptcy over the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., who have already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 per month for the company’s management, received a $4 million “succeeding bonus.”
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created an annual schedule with seven or eight films to come to cinemas in early 2012.
In addition, they plan two films after “The Little Hobbit” in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films, which are to be produced under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who has funded about 18% of the MGM loan, attempted a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, its largest shareholder.
But the last negotiations between the two companies led to no results.
Tech Toys Keeps Your Gift Budget Balanced
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can tear a considerable hole into your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 doses of play-doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I visited three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys-R-Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore’s law had come into force, and this year the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost less than last year.
And although fewer new toys with their own website appear, a wider offer is found on the most well-known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
There are more and more button-cell-operated toys on the market, and many include rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not stated otherwise, all the prices of Toys-R-Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years old) are plumage figures, as large as sea pigs that sing a note when pushed on their belly.
Press once corresponds to a note, by multiple pressing you can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Note: once you have started pressing, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of gift and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplays such as 'Simon says', and thanks to its novel hinge feet with wheel blocking, it dominates the Moon walk.
Children testing the device use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back there (Hasbro/Playschool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of questionnaires with which a car ride can become an hour of instruction, with a better-wiser with car correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to trust your child’s smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard, but the games contained there are not as educational as the one on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
i XL of Fisher price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) used for games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 by Hasbro, for children from 8) and the five blocks are no bigger than a string of wood shafts and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting together the blocks in words before time passes. It is great for an improved lettering competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go alone after the offer in the toys shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important ones.
To give your child an online tier in the Penguin Club, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 - Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts at the Penguin Store Club.
These can be roller shoes or a Puffle fabric.
The latest head cell-operated microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle quickly moves on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It’s fun to send him through an erring garden out of knots.
And he's holding out some.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived for some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are getting softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked over an urban square, checked his nervous subjects and gave orders with military authority and muted voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary races and their attachment to violence - to impress the spectators.
“Standing straight.”
\"Blick straight-
“Teach them, whispering to them, how beautiful girls are.”
Four girls, hardly outgrown by the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants standing tight.
Four pair of black pumps were in straight line.
Four well-kept hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-and-white stripes.
“For me, they look on average,” Mr Tang notes in an unassuming way.
\"Modes are beautiful -
Several governments have already tried to uplift the image of China’s city inspectors.
In one city, all new candidates must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a shining blue uniform instead of the grey green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by low-stars: In 2009, 50 officials reportedly constructed an improperly constructed Imbis car and stared at the operator until it packed in after half an hour and left the space.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have strengthened the urban police lines, especially because of their appearance, their good character, and their youth.
You should give the gross police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, so the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials may enforce the urban laws only with the help of fines or other administrative penalties.
However, the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei beat a viewer to death when he filmed her with his cell phone as they dropped a protest action against a garbage hall.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year a Shanghai water melon dealer suffered after a handcuff with five officials brain injuries.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the internet shows officials trained in China in an attack on road dealers.
\"Chengguan is afraid of the government - lamented the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy over tactics.
The newspaper requested a “real thorough cleansing”
Skeptics find the current approach to significantly inadequate.
When the district was looking for eight female recruits in October, an Editorial in Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or were just supposed to serve as optical distractions.
Probably both.
Women aged 18 to 22 were sought with a good figure and “harmonic facial tracts.”
You should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activity for women is more than 25 physical exertion.
“The most important thing is their image,” stated an unnamed district official at the almost government website Rednet.com.
Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc.
Then there are temperaments and “inner qualities”
“Female Chengguan are like flower vases,” he said, adding, “but they also have other duties.”
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's city administration, does not want to add to this description,
However, admitted that in China, sizes in job ads for both genders are not uncommon.
The same applies to uniform facial tracts.
Whether this is similar to good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical abductions do not need to apply.
“We can’t use lambs or bucks here,” Mr. Zheng said.
“Your image wouldn’t be good.
Liu Yi, who patrolled on the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple cakes and a well-formed mouth.
They did not feel as sexist that so great a value is placed on their appearance.
\"Find, I look sexy in this uniform - ask her with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the Countess, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, \"We have the task of representing the city's image.\"
According to your information, they do not regret the short setting, since they had more ambitious career plans than simply sending dealers through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip deals with about twelve road traders who try to sell as many breads and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on the bike before being chased on.
“Mr. Wang, please disappear here.
“We’ve said this so often,” said Frl. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had left his needle kitchen fixed on a bicycle car.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than demanding.
“It’s almost every day the same,” explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in leisure.
\"All routines \"
One reason is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of traders, as their male colleagues do.
You can only threaten to report criminal offenders to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public attacks, which officials in China are often exposed to.
In this year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rallied after the rumor curtailed, Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were thrown down or burned.
Xindu has been spared from such violence so far.
But unrest is not excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square where the female officials patrolled that morning, over 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was in violation of the rules on the rise of citizens rather than in a workshop.
The owner screamed Zeter and Mordio.
After a 15-minute delay, officials with a grim face made their way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male strip, remained behind, turning his white name shield around to remain anonymous.
Like their terminals, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
“Sometimes we’re going verbally ahead.
“Sometimes, too, it’s physical,” Mr. Li explains.
“Most of the time, people start arguing.”
Attorney will not charge Senator Ensign
State attorneys of the Ministry of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from the charges raised against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying activity, the Senator's attorneys announced on Wednesday.
This decision ended the most serious lawsuit against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada, until the scandal, which caused headlines nationwide and put a damper on his career, he considered as a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was pleased with the judgment after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate’s ethics committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's attorneys, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigation against Senator Ensign had been suspended and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to express itself to the case.
The ruling was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents that were first published in the New York Times in October 2009 gave occasion for the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, was helping to secure orders to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife, Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as treasurer during an election campaign Ensigns.
Ensign contacted some political friends to give Hampton work, and according to the documents and hearings, he took over for them after setting Hampton's lobby work.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to take lobby work for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to the statement by ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which had been close friends before the affair, opposed the so-called ban on the rotational door lobbying.
According to the published Indies, “it’s all seem to be a deal and a violation of the spin-door statues,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients who are in the vision of the government.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics attorneys said the Ministry seems very cautious in taking political charges after a multitude of defeats committed by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to drop charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct on the part of the prosecutor.
State attorneys — being obviously horrified — said Melanie Sloan, chairman of the Association’s “Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington — (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them,” she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another day in which he was informed that the Ministry will not raise any complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the Senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, \"acted in accordance with the law.\"
Mr. Coggins refused to explain the legal arguments he had presented to the prosecutors.
“I don’t think it’s possible to go into the discussion details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much has been said: we believe to have made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to suspend the investigations due to a separate complaint by the ethics group after which a $96.000 payment of Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the Federal Election Act.
The electoral commission said there was not enough evidence that the money had been something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that had long supported the Senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton was found thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyist work.
An email from December 2008 proves that after Mr. Hampton continued as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was in the Ministry of the Interior for a matter of \"crash\"
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch, and asked the Minister of Transport to approve a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had set up lobby work.
For the first time in the last year, Mr. Ensign, apologised to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had stood fourth in the rank of Republicans.
After he was no longer noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police research, his press spokesperson Jennifer Cooper, the Senator, hopes that the Ethics Commission will follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and set up his investigations.
“Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of people in Nevada,” she said.
Cheshire call makes attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tipped away in the Krawalls in the courtroom.
In the minutes, they sent their reports on gruesome testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and bed chained children in a house that went into flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judge's ruling on the death sentence pronounced by the jury falls.
However, Mr. Hayes has already submitted applications to court, which provide reasons for a call and which the courts will work for years to come.
One of the most provocational reasons is that due to the intensive reporting of the process - also through the intensive use of Twitter by average reporters - it has become a “circular atmosphere” and such a widespread, immediate intrusive detail, so that the jury has been ineligiblely influenced by the public demolition.
This opposition could cause the Court of Appeals to deal with the question of whether the new technologies will make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
“As I have experienced it during this process, I believe it is really a danger when the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of every individual to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hay’s chief defender.
The chairman, Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Chamber Court, said last week that the application was short-lived and dismissed, when he said that the New Media would be “careful-controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court allegations have found that reporting on famous cases has raised doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In his 1966 historic decision, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the ruling against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an Osteopath from Cleveland, who was to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there had been a \"carnival atmosphere in the courtroom\" due to the New Media.
Some believe that the television series and the movie \"On the Escape\" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court claims that Mr. Hay's conviction was considered half a century later might follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication paths from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
“There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes pursued by a broad public,” said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said that some appeal courts might be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes more fair.
The Twitter issue is only one of many who present Mr. Hayes' lawyers to discuss years and thus delay a conviction.
The defendants also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been prejudged when Judge Blue did not allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome testimony during the jurors selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their breeders, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, had met with disgust.
The defendants say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge has falsely exchanged a judge who has been a critic of the prosecutorship, and that he would not have been able to put pressure on the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a verdict they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor's office and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously re-encapsulated the flames of emotions over the case.
“One such daily urgency of media pipers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “has not yet been experienced in New Haven and perhaps even abroad.”
Your focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more obvious than reports that are being reimbursed more slowly is a technically hostile view that poors the reporting about future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeals courts would often face the argument, social and technical changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers are strengthening this claim.
It referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in which Dr Sheppard's condemnation was lifted due to reporting and made it clear that the New Media requires new rules.
\"This case, they wrote, \"represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century.\"
Can politeness connect the separating end?
After a campaign of sarcasm and negativity this week little politeness has erupted in Washington.
Is it a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you return to the struggle of the parties in the capital quickly?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the heads of Congress brought no break into the big issues with which to deal during the so-called ‘lame Duck Session’, the meeting at the end of a period of government, in which no decisions will be made.
After all that you hear, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a party-point collection.
The public meeting of the President’s deficit commission on Wednesday was likewise civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months causes mutual respect that obscures the ideological gap that continues to separate members from one another.
That’s hardly enough to claim it’s a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - which calls for one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise readiness, while trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a re-party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep as to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, donations, health or expectations, both sides are miles away.
Finally, the November election of Washington voted mildly for a short time.
“No question, the sound has changed,” said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the ‘Ethics and Public Policy Center’.
“This is inevitable after elections.
Elections raise party passions that die again.
And that's good.
In some questions, especially in those who stand on the agenda of the ‘lame Duck Session’, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one approves.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all of them, be it temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise with regard to the increased unemployment benefits is expected, albeit only because Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favored tax cuts for the rich while refusing to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased, that in these issues you can ratified some and at the same time also the New START Treaty during the “lame Duck Session”.
But William Glaston of Brookings Insituation warns that successful cooperation in urgent issues of the Lame Duck session does not necessarily have to lead to a permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is called in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of nonconformity is more likely, perhaps even inconvenient.
“After the things that have to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this sceptic is shared by many - the politeness leads to true cooperation.
“I see a lot of what is happening from today until 2012, as pre-fighting, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the opening up of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters whose education was serving.
How concerned the Republican leaders may also be that they are too poking too high, they know they need to try to reduce their promises to the government's spending and put the health reform out of force.
These lines of the party will already be evident in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include tax reform and the raising of taxes as well as the increase in pension age and the reduction of state expenditure.
Deputy Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have so strongly pushed to put the deficit question on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are fighting very hard to get close to that number.
The largest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, since in financial issues, at least today, there is little playing room or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two stages in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes, when Republican Obama challenges with regard to the state budget, taxes and the health system, later followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish that the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to a sack gas, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Anyone who is convicted of losing will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may actually be an optimistic view.
Partyity and polarization are larger today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties view 2010 as a pure preview of a far more extensive election in 2012.
Thus, the politeness that will be shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
However, it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common noun in the questions that the two still separate from each other.
Passed U.S. document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The city’s control lies in the hands of the “clemency democracy” and it gives some of the bribes and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin, as reported in February the American Embassy in Russia in a memo.
Both police and the state security service are pushing high-security funds to keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimized businesses but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has referred to as “the agenda of authority” - takes part in the money that the leader is moving up.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of the Ambassador John Phrystle, was released on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly any evidence that in the meantime it would have been imposed.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction firm, have repeatedly rejected corruption charges over years, and he has won numerous slanderous charges against such charges.
In September he explained to a Russian television station when he was asked for a document suggesting that he was corrupt: \"It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty.\"
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as in the ambassador’s report, individuals are called, and it is unheard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
“The direct connection between the government of Moscow and crime has led some to call them ‘disturbed’ and conclude that the government is acting like a cleptocrat rather than a government,” the memo said.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘kryshna’ (a term from the world of criminals / mafia, which literally means ‘dach’ or protection) that extends across police, state security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as throughout the Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
“Luzhkov is at the top of the list.
“FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage.
“Lastly, the ordinal criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level.
“This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help.”
The report goes on to say that the FSB is cashing money from the largest companies and arresting the police small businessmen.
One source, it is said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get protection from MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than criminals, but also because they are protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection through criminal acts is no longer as requested as before.
The memo notes that while collecting funds is comprehensive, protection itself is very modest not; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay, find their business closed very quickly - due to one or another taste.
Medvedev spoke several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men going into the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucracys,” said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commissioner, recently in an interview.
\"But he's part of this bureaucracy.
“It’s not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists.
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation from the violence, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Countrywide, as estimated, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranked 154 a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (nationally, from “the least corrupt” to “the most corrupt”).
The revelation of the memo of the American Embassy, which occurred after Moscow's time late in the evening, will certainly trigger misdemeanors within the Russian government, although, as Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow's failure, it can also be a way to claim that one can solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be an attachment and responded angryly to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it’s about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest, we wouldn’t have expected this to be seen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know.”
Khmer Rouge Veterans Forced to Confront the Past
In a poorly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and leafy walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it, of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
“Everybody here loves the Mok.
“He was a good leader and he cared for his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after Khmer Rouge's surrender to the government, longtime supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to face the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a schoolbook that for the first time told children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a UN and Cambodia community tribunal sentenced, for the first time, a former member of the Khmer Rouge, when it sentenced the former chief of the notorious Tuol Slang Torture Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments growing fear among the Khmer Rouge Veterans Alnlong Vengs, their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodian society have been complicated.
“There is still opposition and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia’s documentation center, an independent organization that explores the regime.
“For them life was glorious under the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.
“It splits families,
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed, or they died of disease, revision, or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Thailand on the border of Cambodia.
They spread here until December 1998, when the last movement capitalized, unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement sponsored by the UN in 1993 led to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to cross the government, leading to the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not resigned, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he waited for his trial.
As their opponents no longer protected them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the ravaged poverty of rural Cambodia and many preserved the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though some of the Khmer Rouge’s few elite officials retained their local government posts because they put down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
“These people have benefited very little from the capitulation,” said Sok Leang from the Center for Justice and Recency, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
\"They are anchored in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime.\"
\"They grew up without any professional knowledge.\"
Sor Lim, 55 years of age, who joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, fought in the jungle for Veng, before leaving in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
“To Mok has given everyone something to eat.
“But now life is hard because we have to care for ourselves.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try to put Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, in court.
The court's order is to condemn the old leaders and those primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether further acts will be pursued beyond these four cases.
This has helped little to ease the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64 years of age, who during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s had been district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007, she had told officials of Cambodia’s documentation center that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damm, a project where thousands of forced workers were probably killed.
On a hot evening, In Chaem came back from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun casts long shadows on the drowned grass, In Chaem refused to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court charged them, she would refuse to go, she said.
\"Cambodians live in peace and stability,\" she said.
\"If there were no more persecutions, war would be here.\"
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would charge more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
“Kambodsha has to dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to go forward, Chhang Youk said from the documentation center.
“Accommodating with the Khmer times means bringing the broken pieces together,” he said.
“It is our duty to put together these broken parts, so that as everything can understand, so can we.
The Centre created the first schoolbook approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page \"History of Democratic Cambodia\"
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the History Book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
“My family rejects many parts of the book and the court,” he said.
“They’re suspicious because they’re not sure how many people are condemned by the court.”
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence,” he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Above in the Dangrek Mountains, one of shrubs overcrowded and with plastic trashed path leads to a rectangle of black root, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was placed here after his death in 1998.
Noom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile phone salesman on the roadside, said she didn’t know much about the man who had been burned here.
“But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to pray to him,” she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas' birthday and later that day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will lay down a bush of mature bananas - hoping he brings her happiness.
Belarus agrees not to collect any more weapons-resistant uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign for global security nuclear material, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect high-enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to no longer collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
However, U.S. officials told the Washington Post that two secret agreements with Belarus have been made in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons-resistant uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitiveness of the subject, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama’s “Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations” of April, which had been excluded by Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat in the Nuclear Security Summit (of 2012).
“This proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement \"a very important, important step\" from Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure everything precise nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
“How to maintain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally armamentable, and less enriched uranium,” Lukashenko said.
“That’s our raw material... We won’t make dirty bombs from it and we won’t sell it to anyone.”
“We use it exclusively for research purposes, that’s all —
However, a few months ago, Belarus approached the U.S. when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first start to remove the uranium Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily irradiated, officials say.
It has been loaded into a special train, which is more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal factory, officials say.
The second stop was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the official by plane.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with poorly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely cautiously coordinated and coordinated to build trust — which led to the agreement signed by Clinton — Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, who is working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Revealing Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-resistant uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp until 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States had been tense for years, primarily due to Lukashenko's harsh disregard of human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
“The progress of these global security issues is welcome, the United States of America and Belarus announces that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens.
No objections from the Spanish government against CIA aid
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA's agreement with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantanamo, as revealed from a telegraph of U.S.A. ambassador to Madrid.
It is added that former deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested that the Spanish government be informed to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain will be adequately monitored.
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid to human rights-defying practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, was charged, the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega spoke.
The deputy head of government admitted that the Council's report \"has met Zapatero in the absence\" and replied that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
“De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objections to the intelligence flights across the Spanish state.”
\"They just want to be informed - not to be \"unpreparedly surprised\" - reports Aguirre via cable.
Former Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government “does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence as they lie in the hands of the judges.”
In January 2007, Attorney Vicente González gave the message to understand that he would not request the judicial initiative to block the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defense on the CIA.
“These reports do not contain any harmful or sensitive information,” the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the U.S. was more concerned about the “possible coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors” than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will simplify our efforts to deal discreetly with governments,” Aguirre laments.
At a lunch in March 2007, where U.S. ambassadors and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that “although the Spanish judges were madly thinking about their independence and doing what they considered appropriate, he gave instructions to his employees to avoid blowing up rhetorical comments in order to let the tension flow,” he said.
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the approach of the PP in this matter.
“Despite their generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt, from an indication that the U.S. government’s Zapatero’s actions, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, has tolerated or deliberately ignored, will strike capital even if these revelations could negatively affect the U.S. government,” he said.
The child killer admits that she has complained on the Internet about the “mourning” of motherhood.
The young woman spoke about the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: “Terror in a Gaelic way”
Mondica Juanatey Fernández is on the internet \"Muki\"
Under this nickname, which she takes from small, she keeps in touch with a cusine and at least one girlfriend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand this, you need to know their love life, which rebuilds the daily ABC newspaper on the basis of witness statements of their family members.
The 30-year-old Gaelic woman recorded a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She held for a year.
Shortly after she dissolved her relationship, it was announced that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his ancestors never allowed him to perform DNA analysis.
Shortly after that, she started a different relationship.
The elector was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balears to care for herself in the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: “Alberto is very peculiar and sour because I came to work -
“When I told him that, he found it good, but now, of course, he sees what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, do and let what he wants.”
Later, she mentioned a message she just received on the phone: “I want you to come back this month or get me an address to which I can send you to the boy.”
She laments: “If he doesn’t like me leaving the boy with my mother, I’ll get him off when I’m back.
In May, she says of her return to her village: “This week I’m going there, but I’m only going to stay there until the 19th because I have to present myself to work if I don’t want to lose it.”
She explains that she takes her firstborn with her when everything goes well.
“He will be with whom he must be, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with someone out of my mother’s way again, a doubting intention when one considers their bad relationship.
There is another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy, who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
\"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, not -
“On the one hand, he likes me and the place, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day.”
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
“Where he (the boy) will attend a summer course, I have less spending for the girl of the child.”
17th: Memories and Complaints.
“A giant kiss from César, who asks me when you come.”
“Alberto says he sent me some videos to the email. If he wants, he finds me, such a mess.”
One more thing: “The boy is doing well. He is going to a summer course to learn Catalan.
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: \"He's shooting me money--
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself “Muki, the prison leaver.”
\"Terror a la gallega\".
The last man who lived with her, a destitute hunting officer, explains having conscience bites because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Mondica was transferred to Palma Provincial Prison yesterday from the Center for Prison of the Court at Menorca.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, explained that she could not remember the execution of the case, “and she did not have the intention of adding to the minor harm.”
Previously, however, she had been able to drink César in the bath and have his body covered in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutorship requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona could play a crucial role.
After the significant increase in vote and MPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking at the parliamentary elections - or not - and their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes reached by this party in those elections is usually twice as high as those in the Catalonian elections.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this number was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
On the last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this rising trend - result of the conversion of the PSC's voting share and the binding of the PP's electorate - should be stopped, the analysts of the PP predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressional deputies, while CiU four (she has now 10) would gain to it and the PSC would lose at least 9 MPs (of 25).
These calculations prove the fundamental meaning of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the People's Party analysis, the ERC would lose a MP - currently it has three - while ICV could hold or win its MPs.
However, if the election calendar is to be maintained, the next date with the municipal elections in May 2011 will fall. Also, the People’s Party (PP) may be the tongue on the scale to end socialist rule, namely in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the city council of Barcelona, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists can neither achieve a majority nor profit from their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not waived that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona municipal council, where it would have to reach 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP recorded an increase in its share of vote in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced to be able to play the lead role in Tarragona’s conversion, where they ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, along with the PP.
En Lérida lies the PP just 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, éngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Giant, the People’s Party could identify significant growth.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and aims to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell concerned Al Qaida thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian police officers arrested by the Barcelona Police Department formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the \"Motive to Liberation of Tamil Eelam\" (LTTE) and \"Laschkar e-Taiba\" (Let) - the latter was the author of the assassinations in Bombay, which demanded 106 deaths in 2008 - with passports.
The Spanish Minister of Interior has given this investigation a great importance, which goes so far as to assure him that the “ Operation Kampai” has been “definitely weakened” by Al Qaida’s attachment device worldwide and, as a result, its ability to act.
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where these were faked and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that its fighters could cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries in impunity.
The discovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist networks that was active in Europe, which is why other European police units, in addition to the Thai investigation bodies, have also been involved in the research, and it is not to be ruled out that the EU will be in the next few days similar to the attacks carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistan Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another action was carried out in Thailand, where Pakistan's Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai countries of Sirikanlaya Kijbübreung were arrested.
They had led from Bangkok from Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - has in particular stolen tourist passports in accordance with the requirements of the so-called International Islamic Front -
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several more years; they were not allowed to have a visa stamp.
It is emphasized in the investigation circles that so far no links between those arrested in Catalonia and the assassination in Bombay could be detected, although the author of this assassination, \"Lashkar e-Taiba\", was one of the receiving groups of those stolen in Spain and subsequently faked in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia from a money transfer company, several thousand dollars had been sent into the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the “order” that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized an extensive documentation.
PP calls for a meeting of the tax agreement by Mas
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to personally submit Artur Mas's terms to support his appointment as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are not distinguished from those already held during the election campaign and can be combined with the priority of economic resurgence and the absence of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement that the regionalist leader wishes to propose at the height of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan People's Party turned to Artur Mas, who granted her the 18 MPs she won last Sunday - a number more than enough to feel indispensable. Because the candidate of the Civil Regionalist Party CiU is required to have at least one of the opposition parties to vote in his office of the vote.
The future alliances that regionalists want to enter the Congress in the upcoming parliamentary elections depend on a possible detainee with the PP. However, the talks that Mas currently conducts with the other party chiefs are all about Catalonia.
In the case of the PPC, the party president calls for all discourses relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia, as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the State and the Autonomous Region, similar to the Basque Country, and which the party chief of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum.
Both political leaders feel that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration slimmer and to eliminate the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on the arrival of Mas are covered by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV) - who will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Old Care Home affirms that the deaths are not based on “failing measures”
The owners of the Altenheim in Olot do not exclude their caretaker from killing over eleven elderly people
The responsibilities of the Old Care Home of La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference where they found out the damage the criminal actions Joan Vila Dilmés had caused - the caretaker, who, during his work, had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible - had added to the institution.
The head of the old care home, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced that “La Caritat wants to sue the responsible person (for the deaths) - but “the right and our obligation of liability force us to accept the process and civil liability.”
The institution must not only reduce a loss of social status, because it did not establish the criminal actions of the caretaker in time, but also now also pay a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime returned in August 2009 and that he has since committed further murder.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were handled by telephone due to their age and diseases.
The leader of La Caritat destroyed this point all around, explaining that “remaining measures could not have been the reason for the incidents.”
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “in the dispute of law, there is no indication of a person’s frivolous actions other than the accused.”
The already-dead angel who was baptized before yesterday declared eleven murders, committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and one and a half months later murdered the second old lady.
In this case, he died with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various soothing agents.
The leader of La Caritat explained that access to the medication staff is only difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the conspirator cocktail used six out of nine committed crimes to free the patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory investigations will reveal whether Vila lied and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned it from the inside by giving them blights, as he had done in the case of three women he murdered between October 12 and October 17.
In La Caritat, one does not give the caretaker’s statements, not even as to the number of murders that could be much more serious, so this statement is justified in saying that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it made no sense to suddenly change his course after eight successful murders.
They said they made themselves available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents of justice.
Threats of the European Central Bank (EZB)
The investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that “the markets should not underestimate our response assets”
The risk levels of Euro-Peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
At the same time, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be fooled and that the euro has little to do with points that cause concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an ill-fluent market, which in the extent to which it collapses, however, as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, which the ECB will have to make a withdrawal tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several more times in the future.
The Federal Bank called for the binding of the plan for the purchase of state debt, as these were ineffective, and the elimination of all extraordinary limited liquidity measures, and only a one-week unlimited access will be maintained.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect current liquidity measures — at least until March — to be extended and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access to the quarter end to ensure liquidity will be maintained until at least June.
We also expect the program to continue to purchase bonds and to issue a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of the markets will be re-suspected yesterday and if half-starred insists that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As with the ECB meeting in May, in which the bank refused to consider the purchase of state debt papers and the markets subsequently collapsed, this story could repeat tomorrow.
The sheep must be faithful and firm.
In May, she showed the teeth and on Wednesday, she said she had already bought a lot, which caused her to provoke a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The state assets management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the preceding auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basic points throughout the curve, thus reflecting a change in perception of the markets according to Trichets.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated to be about 10,000 million short-term and possibly more than 15,000. There will be time until February to acquire private capital or these banks will be stated.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after it failed to recognize the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures are acceptable as part of the rescue plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to receive parliamentary approval on the next Tuesday on its new budget, since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summits of the heads of state and government on December 14, where political unity is required to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries are the ninth Symphony Beethovens.
The Spanish President of the Government presented yesterday the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Rent reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, degradation of the state deficit, liberalisation, privateisation and job creation measures.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has grown by 4.5 percent, double as much as the rest of the European stock exchange.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish Central Bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprising effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year state bond that will benefit from the trichet effect, so we are relying on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our ability to repay.
For Spain, applying for an auxiliary plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we don't need. The treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be permanently closed.
Nevertheless, our strategy should match the motto Caesar's wife: \"Now it's not only the being, but also the appearance.\"
Just courage, we can do that!
At the request of his children, the CEO of Eulen is fighting the Vega Sicilia Social Assembly
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the Eulen and El Enebro companies, does not fade.
David Álvarez, founder of the company gurppe, will oppose the El Enebro Society Assembly, which will be held at the request of five of its seven children on the 16th, as he considers it “absolutely void.” His children will try to get a majority to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new chapter of justice in their dispute about controlling part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest holding of corporate services does not appear to be ready to comply in his legal dispute over the control of El Enebro’s organs.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed as members of the Board of Directors on 18 January of this year, which has already been registered as objectors in the Trade Register.
The Social Assembly of El Enebro, appointed by the Court of Commerce number 2 of Madrid for the 16th, triggered a new thunderstorm in the shot of the Álvarez family.
The judge’s call for the appointment of the Assembly is the only legal way to ensure the vocation of the Social Assembly.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David Álvarez as a \"despised means of defendants - his five children - to be recognized by legal delinquents, fraudulent machining and legal abuse of the Assembly of 18 January - as official speakers.
This argumentation is the basis for the opposition of the assembly in the aftermath to declare it “absolutely void.”
The same protagonists, who were whispering in discrete silence, tried unsuccessfully to call an assembly on a judicial basis in June.
At El Enebro - asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group calls for the right of use of 51% of capital.
This is the actual background of the case that the judge has to decide in the hearing on the treatment of the prosecution complaints for which no date has been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon by Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull finished in 2004 in the world of Formula 1, their history in this learned universe is marked by the speed of surprises and successes.
At first, no one gave attention to the newcomer and, despite his steeply rising turnout during the last season, all put on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari last November.
Without wanting to reduce the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault's engine, the \"secret weapon\" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into the hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that did not involve car racing.
This computer science program, called PLM, has been used to develop assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is meant before it is actually built to avoid errors and superfluous costs.
PLM has eased the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russworm, head of Siemens's industrial department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 factory Red Bull — in a few hours, almost in real time — can design and execute the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and during the tests.
Russwaffe results in an average of ten technicians working in the race stables in 1992, which could introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in a season.
In Red Bull's team today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed. With powerful EDV plants, they conduct analysis and all possible changes to the racing car.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the components of Red Bull's racing cars, except the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and security elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that a Formula 1 team can spend for its race in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a 50 km from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially from journalists, are heavily restricted.
Everything that happens there is top secret.
The team comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts into the services of his participation in the racetracks, further protagonists, whose support is invaluable and their fame is equally zero.
The company’s technologist, Steve Nevey, emphasized five years ago that progress in the field of F&E for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, share values have changed. The technology accounts for 85 percent of the success while the pilots’ contribution is estimated to be 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV, because they are “unforeseeable gladiators”
HP will open twenty-two separate stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated his first exclusive store in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes in Barcelona yesterday.
It is the first of a 20-storey sales network with 80 to 100 square meters each intended to open the Multi in Spain over the next two years.
The company has agreed to this initiative with the already existing 16 sales areas in multi-market operations, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, called as an example the converted store at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has worked for thirty years.
The North American Group of Companies aims to set up 200 sales offices in Europe by 2010, 20 of which are branches in Spain.
The first was inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbian) and Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming new openings, but did not conclude that Madrid could be the next goal.
The deputy chairman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of charging opening is always the same. She relies on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American corporate group advises this and takes over the exclusive charging equipment (with interactive products to catch up with).
HP is also responsible for the training of the charging staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not about a franchiseing system and stressed that with the exclusive sales center network, “the customer service and consulting of small and small businesses when shopping and after that, even the packaging will be optimized.”
The Barcelona store has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service builds a connection to the technical center in Maastricht (Holland).
“In this way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days.”
“This system was developed in particular for small and small businesses as well as private customers, because the major companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service,” Helena Herro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals to 'claw' a million customers in three years.
Banco Sabadell’s business executive member, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than any other manager. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for banks, but initially a new liquidity crisis and prophetic time rejects the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, he expects a break-up of interest rates to try to balance banks with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years - a still existing trade.
Sabadell has found the way to take the next three years out and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new three-year management plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without using public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by a million private customers - 700 000, if you withdraw the customers who will lose the bank - which is the big challenge that this bank faces, because so far it has devoted more attention to its customers than to its private customers.
This year, it has added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Your market share among private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, say austerity, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the bank will be presented together with annual final report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish goals in these difficult times, as all banks’ plans have been disrupted by the financial crisis around the world.
Sabadell will complete her four-year-old plan Optima, which was initially designed to last three years, but as a result of the market situation he was extended by a financial year.
Customers leaving the savings are the main target of the bank.
During a breakfast organised by APIE, Guardiola emphasized that 2011 would be a \"hard - year - with great range -
The manager goes on to say that Spain is only “slow” out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be \"very difficult - in two or three years - to create work - fundamental to the survival of banks.
Even if he assumes that the war on passives - which will punish the interest margin - will fluctuate, the risk of the risk that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity, as compensation for dwindling profits, will already be waived to the price of loans.
“The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will put pressure on the loans.”
“We haven’t turned the fence off, but the interest rates are very high,” said Guardiola.
Banesto already issued the arrangement to its branch network on Thursday to limit the granting of long-term loans and to increase interest rates (see Cinco Días on 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing the stategy to “uplift the fees” but “beside a framework characterized by competition”.
Sabadell’s leadership plan is based on organic growth, even if the group does not, as always, exclude corporate business.
He does not in no way guarantee that in Spain “greater companies are necessary”
“In the coming year everything will change, he assures us.
He emphasizes that the need for capital is currently “enormising” and does not exclude some Spanish financial institutions from falling in red numbers.
He believes that the FROB can replace the money market at captitaloopstockings.
After ensuring that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he dismisses the argument of some bankers who are already prophesying a new liquidity crisis.
It emphasizes that nothing can be achieved in circulation, but in contrast to the events in June, short-term funding on repo transactions can be achieved and the crisis can be taken off.
CECA excludes a second fusion shaft of the savings axles
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility that it could come to a merger wave of the Sparkasses and emphasized the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the Spanish Sparkasses concentration process began, several Sparkasses did not participate in the first phase, and they held the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkassess Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
“I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round; instead, it was adaptations.
“Most of it is completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all the important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all the operations.”
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Manager Aragoniens (ADEA), Olavarieta said that the concentration process was “as soon as possible accomplished and that we must be satisfied with the timely execution, which in previous times, not now, was established in the context of the business plans with Banco de España,” he stressed.
“The transition of 45 savings with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger than we have fulfilled the Baseler Agreement.
Olavarrieta said, \"There are a number of unsolicited opinions about the long-suffering of the process, the insanity and insanity -- revealed, because \"Banco de España urges us to finish on time just before the end of the year.\"
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and, perhaps, the whole world, and added that those who doubted this would do so “without a deeper knowledge.”
The manager noted that in the current economic economy, we must not worry about the situation of financial institutions and savings, which have gone through a very important, concentration process that will be carried out as soon as possible.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had been very good at the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time has set up conditions for the entire European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has introduced new adjustment measures, starting with tax cuts for small and small enterprises, the regulation of time-consuming companies or the reduction of the 426 euro support for unemployed people who do not have unemployment, to the privateisation of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, former government leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of former government president Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not a failure of her public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of re-defined the euro.
Germany is taking a fundamental new perspective on the design of our future, which collides with the maintenance of the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, we start speculating about three possible routes from the crisis in Germany.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south had to leave the euro area.
The second: The re-entry of the German Mark - although it currently sounds more like science fiction - is supported by a majority of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a remodeling of the euro in accordance with German proposals: more macroeconomic control; strict budget management; punishment of countries that violate the requirements; possibly the setting of payments of some countries as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been signed for some time, which is why there are no reasons now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government withdrew a constitutional reform from the sleeve to prevent this from happening as of 2016.
This was the first sign of the conflict between what Germany considered necessary (strong tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country out of pain when Merkel made the decision to rescue Greece.
At the time, this was heavily criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel comes out with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union Agreements to enable the rescue of a country while at the same time requiring private lenders to carry part of the cost.
This position has been defined as anti-European, as it drives the Irish crisis and everything that follows.
But her proposal, though a little delay, was adopted, and in the next few months we will be taking part in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures to take place as of 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not remember it.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures need to be taken now, there will be no longer the old functioning of the euro from this date.
2013 will be the birth year of a new currency space in which the renegotiating countries will be severely punished, may be forced to declare themselves indecent and must take part in the private sector in this case.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth course, with high savings and investment rates, measurement of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness as well as positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it was led by Spain in booming times, is simply not accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad to not understand it.
It is not just about going down the state deficit to 3 percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences will pass into more rest.
And that we will take advantage of the possibilities that we are offered until spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite Merkel's criticism of creating the hypothesis of order in her own home, her way has been prepared.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn’t look like something would change about it.
Among the possibilities taken into account is the fact that we have to leave the euro space fully stopped with few serious countries, not to exclude.
In this case, Germany could still tell us it warned us.
Sports and regulation
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show the spirit of invention, but not the will to go about a sanction.
The extradition set up by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being shed on whether it was an unsportsmanship or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is commonly known, the two players lost a few minutes before playing (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls so the judge showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will meet the required penalty in the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next stage without cards.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this type of sport followed - that it is part of the ethos.
Part of the debate on the case presented goes back to the fact that a team of the Real Madrid football club (who had given in his hymn gem and honor and had punished his players for similar incidents) played the lead role in this, and on the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history than a theatrical and provocatory technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether the conduct which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a change of rules; in fact, this procedure adheres to the rules of the sport, but seems to be in harmony with its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused by the sport spirit should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the physical innocence of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the renegotiating players from drawing an unjustified advantage from the counter-team.
The paradox of real Madrid players’ action is that it does not conform to what we usually understand under false play or rule-making, because the conversion of the rule was not carried out secretly to avoid a sanctions, but it should be as obvious as possible to be punished by the judge.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanctions.
Another question is what kind of advantage the renegotiators draw from the deliberate fouls.
It should be emphasized here that the rival was not placed in a less favorable position or that benefits were raised for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, as the club does not have these players.
The advantage obviously lies in the fact that players start the next stage of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it’s a long-term advantage, up to a certain degree, as the team could also get out. In addition, the players with this procedure get a sanction and pass into the second card cycle, in which they get out with a card less than in the first cycle.
This doesn’t make it so clear whether it really is an advantage.
Finally, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sports, which includes strategic decisions in order to obtain the greatest possible benefit from the rules.
In this case, players don’t want to go around the penalty (that would actually be a clear case of regulation), they would rather choose when they are subject to it.
They made a strategic decision to escape without a penalty or to flee from it.
Although the limit between the invention and the regulatory environment is obscured, I believe that this is a clear case of the invention.
I have the impression that the polemic came about by two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the type of provoked rule transmission.
The damage added to the principles of sport through these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offensive to catch up for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar will allow this year an avalanche of reservations to fall to the days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spread, and they do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
As with the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners that run the Barcelona oxygen and leisure activities in the springtime, but as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price-offensive to capture the customer segment, which represents the big mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
In order to make accounting a bit more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders to the week of 13 December, with the result of an avalanche of reservations from dinner to two top days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week prior.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have set up the group dinner for household reasons.
In order not to ignore this tradition, many workers pay them out of their own pocket.
As is the case with the economy, low prices are required, confirmed by the chairman of the Barcelona’s Hospital Remium, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the roofing association has not yet predicted what the holidays will look like this month.
“People think it’s ten times before it’s done.”
“They like to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,” he said.
The business will go well, “offering quality at good prices with good service,” he adds, and reminds us that customers are saving in crisis times, which is why prices are most sought after by 25 euros.
In a survey in a variety of central restaurants, it turns out that the evening of 17 December leads the provider to collapse.
The Soteras Group says that the demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would be booming. The group has adapted their menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, who maintains 16 guesthouses in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the ownership of the calendar has led to preferred reservations, even from the beginning of November.
“We have made it impossible to maintain the previous year’s prices with menus for each taste from €19.95 to €30,” he explains.
At AN Group, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and a total of 23 locals, one does not lose optimism after the second quarter of the year, once the revenue is reflowered and good, albeit focused on a few days for the Christmas business.
Sources of the group of companies emphasized that the 18th will also be an overactive day with friends groups celebrating Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu was added for 30 Euros or more as a price heat. The impression is that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you can see green sprouts, which is why the employees are invited back. This gives the impression that the group food is back on the rise.
From the side of the Fecasarm roofing association (with connections such as Barcelona's knee, restaurant and leisure association), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, is confident to see the end of the tunnel and notices that the reservations are all right - alive - even though the customers \"slept out a maximum -
However, the fun at the celebration did not go back, no matter who paid for it.
Pakistan’s nuclear program is a source of great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons “faster than any other country”
The release of Wikileaks confirms relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence revealed by the Internet portal Wikileaks confirms between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State, which provides enormous concerns to the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
At the edge of the clear and gentle details that the documents provide about the content of the talks and the thinking of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad reveal that cooperation between both countries is not enhanced in terms of atomic security, but, on the other hand, \"removes - and that the unstable Asian country produces more atomic weapons - to a faster rhythm than any other country\".
In particular, the unique nature of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not composed, but that their individual parts are stored to make their destruction more difficult in a possible attack - Washington is preparing sleepless nights.
The following risks include ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear plants to the area attacked by the Taliban, the alleged scattering of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material -
The large number of people who are involved in nuclear alarms and missile programs is seen not only by the U.S., but also by Russia as out-of-date and reason to let caution go.
“Pakistan needs to have strictly believed personnel set up to monitor nuclear installations; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to review people who are working on nuclear or missile programs,” said Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with his North American colleagues.
New documentation revealed by Julian Assange’s Internet portal is that cooperation between the United States and Pakistan leaves behind nuclear distribution and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May an office of the Embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as “frustrative,” explains: “There is no transparency at all; we do not receive any answers or they will be denied;
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, State Secretary of Secret Service for South Asia, confirmed that “as a result of Pakistan’s economic disaster, nuclear weapons produce as quickly as no other country.”
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit of the chief army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, to explain to the controller that “Pakistan’s army has suspended its silent oversuppression of terrorist groups.”
Hunting for Wikileaks Chef
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism campaign to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning about the persecution and discovery of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the affairs can only be explained in difficulty.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a \"red warning\" of Assange's discovery and persecution.
However, this is not a traditional arrangement for arrest.
It is also not new, it is from November 20th.
She also has nothing to do with the last revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the charges of sexual abuse that the Australian must face in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures \"the police where and how they can contact Mr Assange.\"
Already on the 20th, the international police authority, based in Lyon, France, issued the arrangement at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after the possession of the powers by the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and find Assange, “to temporarily capture and deliver him”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member countries, according to the organization’s statements, consider the red warning as a free letter of arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange probably stops.
The process offended Assanges attorneys, who sent a letter telling them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of Swedish authorities by video conference.
It also reminds us that Assange requested the departure from Sweden and was compared by the state attorney, compared to the said Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief of security of Stalin, who received the appropriate approval.
“This is like a hunt, not like a legal prosecution,” is accused in writing.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother of Australia is insulting him for her son's innocence - Assange is staying in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine per Skype from an indefinite place, asking for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it could be proven that she was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats to spy out the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the United States, she would have to resign,” he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the application for resignation “laughing and absurd”.
“I’m not sure why we should put value on a type’s opinion with a website,” he told the CNN broadcaster.
Obama himself has entrusted a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, with the prevention of new document disclosures.
The attempt by President Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators announce these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will lead the presidency in the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, to seize their funds, and to track any who support them or make a contribution.
Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, went further, and he had to withdraw his statement that Assange had to be “killed.”
\"Obama would have to turn it into a target disc and use an unmanned plane or something like that.\"
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
“Anyone who has been able to send information through the government, he is guilty of betrayal and everything that is not a execution is too mild punishment,” he said to Fox.
Puigcercós seeks close peace in the ERC with an eyebrow to the Carod Nearby peace
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its survival in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the full assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to go out of the way for the tenth time an internal riot in the ranks of 11 MPs after the loss of 11 and half of the voter's directionless ERC.
The party chairman is aware that his resignation threat is not sufficient for the close-knit former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Robira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weakened today as its mentor himself and will not shed the same head breaks as other former streams.
That is why the leader of Esquerra is trying to win the new critics with an eyebrow, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the first time yesterday, the over 200 regional council members of the ERC could secretly express themselves about his stay in the office.
With ballots, not with high hands.
If the carodists wanted to miss a sentence to the president, they could do so without having to fear repression.
In fact, the chief wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission among his person.
In several interviews, he denied that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added, without stating percentage values, a result — in Bulgarian style — would also not be good.
The Carod Nearby members call for more than just the party to make his office available. An inadequate gesture as Puigcercós controls the top body of Congress.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the Board of Directors on a process plan from now to May.
For this purpose, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic re-orientation, which will be submitted to the Council on 18th.
Its intention is to be for Puigcercós, and in return, it should promise to present Congress in the autumn of 2011, which the party’s summit already considers a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC is the opinion that the “polyphony” damages stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the acting councillor Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, Innovació's owner considered it to be a fact that the chairman of the party, in exchange for a variety of purposes, will be held.
He numbered five, two of whom are in the lead.
First of all, the Board of Directors, so that this represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod’s environment.
The second could be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC finally give up the full meeting principle as a way of functioning.
He is therefore fighting a reform of the statutes which will allow Congresses to hold with elected delegates.
From the termination of the full assembly model - an exception to the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' team, who fought for it at the last two conventions, as possessed.
In fact, the party leadership at the 2008 vacancy assembly was tasked with reviewing the full assembly principle at a congress that should be involved in reforming the statutes.
This date is still due to the fact that infogle of the internal unrest in recent years was not advisable to address this issue.
Now, without the critical sectors on the laurer, the time could have come to re-open and close this issue forever.

According to MILENIO, four cases less than 2010 were recorded in México.
In November, 23 people were murdered in México, according to MILENIO México figures, the four are less than in the previous month.

In addition to him, the police found a paper with a message.
China keeps its targets for reducing greenhouse gases
China’s representative, on the COP16, explained that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon emissions and that it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China holds its bid to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the representative of this country, assures COP16.
At his first public appearance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei was assured that his country would have made enormous efforts to reduce carbon emissions and to change its industry.
In the last four years, he has invested $245 million in his country to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he explained that China would not change its objectives, but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, building capacity, building institutions and supporting pilot programs.
In all aspects, progress was made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which contained the objectives of reducing the emissions of gases.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the authorities of the states had worked with those of the Central State and the Communities to achieve the objectives of energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he carried out several multi-year plans have already been attacked or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the program for the effective use of energy introduced in the last five years and received investment from the United Nations (UNO), government and private hands.
It also runs a project at the provincial level on climate change, another for the exchange of traditional light bulbs by energy savings, and another for the weakening and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, a scientific government advisor in climate change in this country, confirmed that China’s efforts would be far greater than commonly accepted.
He pointed out that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
It also made unprecedented progress in the field of energetic use, and energy efficiency has increased by twenty percent over the last five years, and by 2020 another thing was to happen, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former Panist Party chairman had the right to contact the National Order Commission and to demand what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former party president of the PAN had the right to contact the National Order Commission and demand what the right granted him.
In an interview that took place before the complaint, Gabino Cué Monteagudos, governor of the state, declared that Espino’s exclusion was a decision made at the local level.
“It is an independent decision of the Ordering Commission in Sonora,
“Mr Espino has the right in his case to contact the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in order to make a decision made by a competent body,” he added.
On the other hand, he stated that it is not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidate has never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened by the internal vote on the next 4th and 5th December, in which his successor is elected.
“This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a prelude to the municipal election, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose.
The panistic leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, which is why “the internal competition does not scare us; on the other hand, we enjoy it and it strengthens us” he commented.
He said that the Council would no doubt choose the best chairman, the Acción Nacional, for the next three years, so he passed the Staff “to those who would determine the Council.”
“I am completely unconcerned and open, and I would be proud to transfer each of the five to the office of the chairman of the party.
He predicted that the party’s turn-up will reflect in the next elections in the last elections of 4 July, although it is not time to think about 2012.
“Today, it’s about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task.
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and observe it all over the country. Therefore, “many hopes and desires are put into them and I am sure Gabino is at the level of the demands”
When asked about the criticism of PRI at President Felipe Calderón for his disc course within the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI supporters to think about the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally get out of the cabinet,” he replied.
He believes that the owner of the Federal Government can make expressions such as those he can make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because there is no oral ban in this country and less censorship.
Obama sets himself up in Twitter for the law in favor of undocumented students
“If you’re a law for the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and urge them to adopt this law,” the President of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported national mobilization to support the Dream Act - Law on Legalization of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
“If you’re a law for the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and urge for the adoption of this law,” Obama tweeted.
Its brief message includes a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document that calls on the public to contact their senators, as the vote of the law is expected immediately.
“With your voice that we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you, he emphasizes.
The message was spread after the 42 Republican Senators threatened to block all vote for any law, except the expansion of tax cuts from Bush's times and the government's funding would expand.
Such a blockade, which was announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could affect the voting of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
Regarding the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects Act, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the other projects.
“I think we still have a lot of time...”
“All of us agree that the tax issue must be handled by the end of the year...”
“I believe that we can make an agreement at any time and then we can plan the end of the rest,” he said.
The President of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would apply for the vote at the end of the debate, so that the Dream Act law, which would allow the initiative to legitimize undocumented students from the next Thursday in the Senate, would be more likely the next week.
The version of the Dream Act - Law or the law of the American dream would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, while living in this country for the last five years and enrolled in a higher education institution or army.
But the defendants of the law need sixty votes for the adoption of the initiative, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At present, the organisations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intensive impact on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, whose majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the defendants of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to return to the initiative.
Among the most respected Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who assumed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared that they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken out for the law, John McCain, has not yet determined his attitude.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the greatest obstacles.
Put the finger into the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Love of Language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the narrative.
“That with sex in the language I understand, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me” asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of ‘Los placeres de la lengua’, a cycle that celebrated Spanish-language literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... 'brings us into trouble' - the Argentine writer snuffed out sweetly to the audience, composed mainly of young people gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend the round table that had been moderated by Marisol Shultz, at which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and signed the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a ‘wound’ is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of whom she does not answer, but receives instructions for the guide of her narrative.
The infectologist leaves her convinced: “Patience is not my strength, maybe that’s my wound.”
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist who caught her in the middle of the gang, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: “The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar.”
The main character of the narrative is easy and concludes that “from the wound it only learned that it is really open and not exist,” but she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps is mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented an exciting story, which he called 'Lob of the Invention', and in which the finger is not mentioned in the wound, but is discovered.
With plays on magical realism, he tells of a famous magician who touched the clouds, brought back far-wished men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turning and reported from America, the great novel, which it did not miss from the beginning to its own chroniclers, and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of the stories told by the conquerors.
\"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories as true, but in other words, America's history would never have been told, with the power of education that even the shame of the moment came to pass.\"
However, he points out that “it is the fools and liars who best imagine things, and there approach reality and lie to each other, where one no longer knows, to which side the narrative belongs, where fictional literature reaches the peak.
He actually calls it the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
“We inherited from him to be what is being told.”
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the diversity of interpretations to which the Phil's invitation to the Round Table 'The Finger in the Wound' had contributed.
The Cubans and Puerto Ricans dedicated their contribution to the great wound of social violence that affects their country, as in Latin America, as a result of the fight for drug trafficking.
“I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, non-purposely planned commitment,” she explained after pointing out that literature is communication and connection that builds between the author and the reader as in a “chemical reaction.”
The evening was decided by Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also \"this finger of the dedicated writer in the wound of the writer\" hevorhob.
He noted that in a fast-living world, the intellectual habits and control of consciousness run out of dogmatism, and will forget, “that behind each confirmation there is a small no and behind every denial a small yes.”
“In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: and nuances often mean to put the finger into the wound and torment those who feel much better when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noticed and invited to rediscover the sense of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in final games, he has experienced Ops and Abs in his career, but three times he played crucial games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey during the final game, there are also two different styles set by their respective coaches, and their encounter marked by opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in final games, he has experienced Ops and Abs in his career, but three times he has had crucial games, and so far he has kept himself well, which is why this occasion is of very special importance to him.
The Argentine has competed with the medal as the second champion, he is a step behind the winners, and surprisingly he has played consecutive final games with the same team.
The Sanctuary Strategy reached the first final game as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the tails in hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the crucial duel he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Even with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to strike a setback again, as the 2-2 game against Los Choriceros went undefeated after 210 minutes, but at the eleven-meter he came forward with 3-1 and got two opportunities to pitch his title, but ultimately three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he doesn't want to be persecuted again and free himself from evil magic to celebrate a title for the first time, although he insists that for him the most important is the game itself.
“I want to be a champion, I don’t want to break statistics, that’s for a club, for my affection that I give myself, and that’s why the title will come to me, but what’s happening before is the most important thing — the controller commented when asked him about the lost final games.
The final game is still strong in memory, he assures us to have learned much from it: “The only lesson we can draw from this is that until the judge does not add the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players are also prepared, because the last time we were prepared to separate with two elf meters, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no occasion for celebration -
Knowing that this series could be decided by Elfmeter shooting, he doesn’t worry, because he trusts his players: “You never want to arrive at the Elfmeter shooting, you want to finish in the regular playing time, but sometimes there’s no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the fierce effort to keep the title in the hands that left us something for this final game, and we hope that it won’t come to that time.
It is in Romanso power to no longer be just the second champion and for the first time to cost the fame that the title brings with it.
The U.S. changes the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves before their consultation with the Consulate at the Service Offices for visa application; costs will be reduced in this way.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa in the Embassy of the United States and the Consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves before their conversation in the Consulate at the Visa Application Services (ASC, the initial letters in English).
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant being reviewed by the consulate before the conversation.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of handling the visa is reduced because it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment agreement, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out.
The applicant only makes a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the contradiction to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for time workers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa need not speak in the consulate, they only have to imagine themselves at the nearest ASC, where they submit their documents and take their fingerprints.
As the biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second appointment for the conversation in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those applying for the visa in the Consulates of Ciudad Thuringia, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the service charge of $26.
Additional information about the new visa application procedure can be found in the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the finding of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency called for a press conference to present tomorrow a fund that will have an impact on the search for living things in all.
The United States National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) announced tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of extraterrestrial life.
The Fund will be presented tomorrow at 13:00 a.m. at a press conference in the headquarters of NASA in Washington by experts in astrology, which is a science that explores the origin, development, distribution and the future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was called up, NASA assured that it would present “a supervisory fund for the search for extraterrestrial life,” triggering speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there can be human-like creatures in hostile environments, which have so far been thought to be uninhabitable, and the hypothesis was that these could change into intelligent living beings, like humans, if their living conditions improved.
Apparently it is a microbe found on the ground of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that has been too toxic to all forms of life as the lake is highly arsenal.
Considering this ability, the microbie uses the arsenic as a survival resource, increasing the chances that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenal, as astrobiologists have shown, “the actual form of life, which is a second form of life, is different from that known to us.”
The Space Agency will announce the actual reach of its fund tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference.
At the conference, the geobiologist Pamela Conrad participates in researching the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon Saturn) under the question of whether its chemical composition of Earth resembles it.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the organ law on Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and an opposition block had already been installed, led by the MPs of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented themselves as independent.
Before the introduction session to the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the organ law as they would be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, would introduce a 'two-party system' because now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled Congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the president-in-chief, led by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political position with these reforms.
He explained that in the next few days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, going out of their political will, and if they didn’t, they would be reimbursed by both parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
“When I come here (the opposition coalition), that’s what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that don’t even consider taking the opinion of the others.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would form.
It cannot be admitted, he continued that Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be “duopolistic.”
\"It is not the spirit of the law reform that is to rule in Congress an eternal two-party system.\"
“For the first time, this group starts with five MPs and talks with other colleagues and colleagues to make them more,” said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT led in a play on PAN and PRI that Congress is currently turning itself into a 'bout' for two.
“It was only one party before that, now they divide it into two.”
Patrón Montalvo asked the Members to respect them and to give them their place in the negotiating table.
The five, which are currently seen as split into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place on the negotiating table, because of the reform that was carried out and agreed on by the others, and we are not in agreement with this reform.
200 000 more peso for \"the supplier\"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electric material.
Another check over slightly more than 200,000 peso in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This means that the sum paid to the owner of the company for electric material in the second half of the year is 1200 000 pesos.
According to the website for more transparency of the city administration, this check was issued on an amount of 200,144,56 peso with number 9258447 on last November 16 with the purpose of billing open invoices.
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money would go from the community to this supplier. She is watched by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells at high prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount that you still owe it and, as a result, the number of checks that are still being issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“It wasn’t purchased with her, it’s just paid the debts, just like with the other suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last check-up, in the last quarter of the year, is re-opened: September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29, October 29, and last of November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is questioned by the ASE to avoid other administrations applying for their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste released the audit of the check-in issued by the city administration to its suppliers on 25 July, it was announced that from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had already paid over 10 million pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also shops with Jumapam, where they included checkers worth more than 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor state of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the collapse of a foreign tourist in the outbreak of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, Mazatlán’s tourism industry asked the authorities to pay special attention to areas in poor condition and to give a bad impression of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of Zona Dorada’s trade union, recalled that on various occasions it was requested to take care of the destination and transform the bad conditions that the tourists face into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the bad state of the streets and roads had a negative effect, as tourists came to the Schlender and saw the disorder to which they would turn to the nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t think about how much money you lose. Otherwise they wouldn’t do the construction work slowly and planlessly in this way.
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist would have made attention to the lack of prevention and the remaining maintenance work on the part of the city.
“The community must assume its responsibility and avoid doing something like this once again. How to do this? Well, through preventative maintenance instead of improving everything in the aftermath,” he said.
“We look forward to having a clean city, because not only because it is a foreign transport area, it must be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition.
“There are other places that also look unskilled and unskilled,” he said, “for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán.
“Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It has to be offered a good product, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps tourist attractions constantly in shots,” he added.
“These provisions have not been given enough attention and these types of incidents are merely what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently necessary.
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they would not be properly used and allowed a bad image to develop.
He mentioned a number of places that had to be brought to the front of the city together with the city. The city should be clean, orderly and attractive for foreign transport.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that must first be raised and cleaned to make them attractive to strangers and to bring them to the inventory with which we advertise for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that MPs should take great responsibility to provide a model for a better Sinaloa that faces many challenges.
Mazatlán’s business industry calls for a worthy parliament, free of agreements between parties and the government, because Sinaloa is overwhelmed and faces big problems.
It is composed of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, feel committed to society and to various social groups that rely on responsible parliamentary work, and do not repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE Board of Entrepreneurs, suggested that the new MPs should take great responsibility to provide a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
“We hope that MPs will truly exercise their right to act free of agreements between the parties, for it is common for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, transforming themselves into nuclear compromises of the governments and the leaders of the parliamentary groups.
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to build the necessary bridges to support the current government.
“We take care that they do a trusted job and are committed to all things for society and its groups, because they were the residents of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in them in the last elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas hotel association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 peoples is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will promote job creation in any way.”
With regard to the foreign transport sector, he urged the new MPs to assign the necessary importance in the state budget to promote the Ministry of Foreign Transport.
“I have understood that it is the ministry with the second most resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro industry.
The tourist projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported, and the alcohol law, which has not been re-established in previous legislative periods, must be up-to-date.
The Holy King is sought
Dolls, cars, bicycles, and other toys wish the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family were sighty.
For the parents, it will be difficult to meet these wishes the next three-day, because the budget is no longer and no less than twelve people and a goat bock.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende, and they live by hand in the mouth, because the father has no hard work.
“Sometimes hard times are said to be because my husband has no job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...I’m going with the gordes to sell on the street in the afternoon,” said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would have liked a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wanted a barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús suggests Cayetana clothing in size for one-year-olds.
(José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would like this monster', but I answered him, 'Let's wait, boy' because it was very expensive - remember Cayetana's sad.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The 11-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaías has the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you would like to help realize the dreams of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King will be sought' by donate a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 alleged drug dealer arrested
On Wednesday, in the context of the destruction of a production and sales network of cannabis, the 10 house searches were carried out in the Estrie administrative region.
Fourteen persons were arrested and various charges were brought against them.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where places were supposed to have served mainly drug production.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served production have been confiscated,” Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec’s security police spokesman.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, of which two of the men who are considered the main wire puller of the drug ring came from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are to have already appeared hours after their arrest before the Justice Building in Sherbrooke.
They could be charged, among other things, with the charge of the production of cannabis, the possession of which could be charged for sales purposes, the business force and the service of crimes.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation that took place for over a year.
“The information received from public sources has allowed us to carry out these arrests — detailed M. Ruel.
Around 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Unit Estria of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphis Police Authority had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could easily be pursued
The law of the Conservatives, which, according to the government, is to regulate the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, will be put in good perspective after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
“I’m giving up on this chart with a resurgence.
\"I'm holding a party that has put you on your feet,\" Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, said after the weekly Caucus session.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows each person identified as an illegal immigrant for up to a year to be transported, violates, as proposed, the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill as he turned against the wrong target group.
“We are opposed and it seems that all opposition parties are opposed, so we are waiting for what the government is doing,” M. Duceppe said.
The criticism regarding the immigration issue of Olivia Chow, NDP, has shown the critics that demand their party not to be stable enough with the secret immigrants.
“The neo-democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and that is what we try to do by issuing another bill, the C-35,” Chow added.
We therefore do not advocate the law of the Conservatives because he is looking for the blame of the refugees and is holding children captive for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring Canadians' will.
“The Canadians are intrusive to the MPs that they do not tolerate this type of secret immigration, these criminal acts involving Canada and that treat the country as a footstool.
“They expect Canada to take tough measures,” said Minister Kenneys.
“The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its bill of law, which could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
However, a Conservative has said to the QMI agency that the government would call for a vote so that any opposing MP would be immediately opposed to its voters.
The new unit does not find any agreement
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit for the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to demand the formation of a public investigation committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement of Wednesday has more than one surprise.
It must be said that this action was not discussed in the least despite the presence of Robert Dutils on the occasion of the meeting of the permanent committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year.
It was also not necessary for Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois to qualify this announcement in punto public security as a “properly enchanted self-taught” solution.
Minister Dutil, in turn, had turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the questioning, future unity.
“You will see the result when we announce it,” he pleased to confirm.
“One is aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
“The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide,” he said.
“The only way to form an investigative committee is to resign from Jean Charest, as Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political systems at ENA (state university for the training of high-ranking officials).
In order to get out of these sack gases, he proposes Quebec to lay down a special mandate for financial audit control in order to enable them to conduct research on corruption and secret agreements.
“One should be able to expand the mandate of the test control,” he decided.
He also argues that the Quebec audit control could provide the same authority of power as Commissioners, which would also allow you to commit people to the statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Government Charest.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal law on the one hand in order to be better exposed to this kind of crime.
This request comes from the Attorney-General of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law in this kind of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security confirmed on his part, his colleague of the Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently struggling with certain novelties in question.
During the 2001 Operation Printemps, which concerned the groups of motorcyclists, 131 persons had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been novelized.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterdom.
Flows under strict monitoring
Several rivers continue to be kept under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has taken place in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, it came to an earthfall on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses have been evacuated preventively.
In the evening another earthquake took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudiere administrative region.
A road has been congested.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall has increased from 40 to 70 milliliters to several regions.
Between 20 and 40 other millimetres of precipitation were expected here in accordance with the regions until Thursday night.
The areas north of the river as well as the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
There were up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
Since the snowmelt has already been gathered in certain sub-regions to these precipitations, the crossing of several waterfalls is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service warned about the flood alarm concerning the rivers of Ouareau and Achigan in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine Mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière will be the object of the flood surveillance and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, the fierce defeats have led to the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an escape bridge was demolished due to the heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service continues to be alerted and the situation is most closely monitored, said security councillor Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec State High Water Center issued a warning of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular of Varinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont in part
The Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) because of its controversial statements on social care and Haitians as well as because of his casual speech on radio.
While the CCNR represents the opinion that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their own opinion, certain statements would have \"unexplained information on the social welfare and unlawful negative representations of Haitians as well as a manner of unsolicited speech which is not appropriate to the broadcasts broadcast on the day-to-day -
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the spread of the names of two persons who committed suicide violated the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts made during 2008 and 2010.
The first available was filed as a result of a complaint made by the “Front Gemonden des Persones Assistés sociales du Québec”.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were not accurate.
Instead, the moderators should provide solid information as misleading.
Regarding suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont expressed the view that suicide is an expression of cowardice.
The majority of members of the Supervisory Board had drawn the conclusion that the message presented is that suicide should not be considered a solution to life's crises.
“The majority of the Supervisory Board took into account that the consequences of the broadcast — Dupont le midi — had cut a sensitive topic in a family-oriented and appropriate manner —
Therefore, he was not charged with anything to his person.
The last point of dispute was the statements that had been made about the Haiti earthquake.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort, on the other hand, had delivered a media-effective dispute that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI Moderator had declared not to have donated in favor of Haiti aid, as you certainly did not know whether the needy would also receive the money donations.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments have not been abusive, but that their cumulative effect represents an unlawful negative representation of Haitians.
“I’ve already spent my three-day suspended sentence on this matter.
“My act has been virgin for one and a half years,” the Moderator said.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board recommends the spread of an unhappily expressed manner.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM has traded broadcasters — in addition to its obligations —.
The consequences for the broadcaster, who, among other things, should have announced his decisions once during the main broadcast period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of the Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who in “Sanda” (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing and in Thai boxing, is now looking for new challenges on the Tatami and the boxing rings of the world.
“I started fighting sports like Kung-Fu and Kickboxes 12 years ago in Algeria,” Zemmal, who has been based in the city since 2008, said in order to further develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the fight of all kinds, since for those who do not like the ground fighting, as he presents the mixed martial arts, competitions in North America are rare.
Recently, his sign as a security officer and the UPS company gave his rivals bad news, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the world championship held between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I have won the victory in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing,” he said.
“At the time, I am preparing for the World Cup in San Shou, China.
“Those fighters were invited from every category who had placed themselves among the first four at the last world championship.
\"I Get Babe in Toronto Bronze\" 2009
“In 2005 I was back in Vietnam.
“In 2007 I finished the tournament in China in fifth place while I became a third in Toronto in 2009” he added.
“It is worth noting that I have made progress in every competition.”
“With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year,” he said.
San Shou, or “Sanda,” are disciplines from China that allow footings and footsteps as well as ground throws.
The two fights usually play on a platform, rarer in a boxing ring.
The most famous boxing fighter, who emerged from this type of martial sport, is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is probably known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal had only retained a single event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super Tournament “King of Sanda” the Super Bowl of Kung-fu.
“This competition is the highest and most respected in China,” said the sympathetic poundskerl.
“It’s a bit like the equivalent to the stadium Lumpinee ( Thailand’s largest stadium).
“This was a super experience.
At the same time, in the semi-finals of his category (80kg), he won his first fight before losing in the final.
“He who defeated me was a real professional,” he said.
“There are four contestants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg).
“The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the finals of their category.
“Then the winners of each category offer their foreheads to crown a single champion, the King of Kung-Fu.
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has agreed to $450 million in mutual project planning companies in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, that of the project management, to a sum of $295 million without tender.
This consortium, called ‘Énergie gérance’, was formed in 2004 as a companion to the decision of Hydro-Québec to overreact to the private sector its responsibility to oversee this important, hydroelectric project in the amount of a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium “Énergie gérance” passed the lucrative contract without having had a public application.
For the Parti Québécois, holding back on business consorties is a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of competition and an increase in prices.
“This is a new way of a mapd game and disqualifies competition.”
“This means that instead of secret games, you are now performing in open form,” said Sylvain Simard, PQ’s MP, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, for it seems hard to understand how the public’s interest can be served in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau had responded to this in the afternoon by arguing that this contract would have been an off-carded game.
\"I remain faithful to my line - she refused by strengthening that the PQ was \"unreasonable\" and she \"failed it.\"
She said it was “the least” that the PQ apologized.
The consortium model is a common practice in the world.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to bundle their expertise with regard to an order for a complex project.
The “Eastmain” project has a high level of complexity with regard to its working size.
The construction process is underway and will be set up by 2012.
At the same time, the contract was awarded without any competition; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec itself in relatively simple projects is no longer an exception.
As the newspaper Le Devoir noted last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of engineering and consulting is the subject of government findings.
A brief overflying of the Quebec company register allows more than 200 consorties to be named, some of which seem to be of permanent duration.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau works together in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and of which there are several dozen, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely to Dessau.
As regards the consortium of the ‘Énergie gérance’, Prime Minister Normandeau stressed that “the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special human rights dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been taking special account of this fact since the 70s in a special way.
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has caused the nose to fall over the fact that the contract on the project management was approved after agreement.
“If you make a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prices will go up quickly.”
“So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this march and say to you: you will be negotiating a satisfactory agreement at a good price.
\"The idea, however, is that the price is not crucial, but the understanding of the people's affairs - reclaimed laports.
This contract, approved to the consortium, is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars received by the part Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by the Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper “Le Devoir” counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts approved by companies or their branches, including resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had made 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking part in ‘Énergie gérance’.
All of these contracts have been negotiated.
They totaled $449,783,344, including the contract with ‘Énergie gérance’ over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had said that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the “Parti libéral du Québec are probably known.
Prime Minister Normandeau had accused the PQ of being equally connected with the companies they “financed” before it specified that it was rather their leaders.
Barometer responsibility-conscious consumption - The green label is not trustworthy
Greener, but undisputed skeptical.
The Quebec Agreement has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also little of the trademarks or eco-signs to control its choice.
Damage, although it bathes in a media-efficient universe, where it only sheds so much light on information in favor of responsible-conscious consumption: Barometer responsible-conscious consumption has a lack of credible information to complain, an inadequacy known as the brake of its commitment, as the first reading showed, which was held yesterday.
Although they have pushed forward the consumption of the so-called socially compatible products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to be the one who are trying to sell them for little credit.
Two-thirds of Quebec’s population admit, in fact, to give the company’s environmental commitment as little faith as the green company’s advertising, so the responsible consumer center at the University of Sherbrooke betrays the measuring instrument.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of the official certificate attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, the barometer said.
According to the same pattern, politicians’ discourse on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebec’s population.
The information on responsible consumption seems equally important to stimulate this segment of consumption, which is currently being used by almost one-third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, empty and questionable character of information paralyzed the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one-third of Quebecers of the stated performance of the green products and services that they are endeavoring to use are suspiciously opposed.
According to another communication, over half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and, above all, changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they also preferred 61% of purchases from merchants of their district and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption reached a maximum of 100 this year - the Quebec gay consumer loves to present himself as king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by caring for animal protection.
However, the social and ecological consciousness seems to have stopped in front of his car, according to the Barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have stated, used public transport in 2010, or preferred the co-car to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The introduction and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants of this comprehensive behavioral survey who fed the cliché presentations.
State bonds for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to work together, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus as well as the company Parallèle, who had hoped to make a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois-related cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, in order to re-respond to its actual cinematic function, do not receive what they have requested.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but to its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec Government offers a loan lower than the initially hoped-for amount, which could bring an existential solution to advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources derived from the state rumours.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million have already been rejected by Quebec last spring, and the petition has been corrected down since then.
A proposal, together with a action plan, was already sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturallles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who leads the eXcentris Act.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final report.
However, the counter proposal from the cabinet was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have time to respond to them until 31 December.
In any case, the premiums of the state donations seem to have really been pushed aside.
Let us remember that the Quebec-owned community of cinemas and cinema complexes had leaned against a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by presenting the argument that the Minister of Culture has no financial assistance for real estate projects there, which he has not even left other cinemas.
However, several other market participants of the segment complained, in contrast, of substantial economic aid.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema for over ten years, cinema head Daniel Langlois had presented the author's cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception on the part of the state cash.
The lack of cinema halls showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to hold his clientel at the rod.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top are launching a privately funded campaign, which they hope to raise $700,000 in order to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one canvas has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of future buyers is to re-open the three cinema halls on February 27 next year with the performance of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois —Des hommes et des deux.
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not dismissed the newspaper “Le Devoir” and one ignores what he and his group hold from the down-to-down suggestions they have made.
The secret of the complex-skulled Canada aired
The new U.S. diplomat lines, which were spread by WikiLeaks, revealed the secret of what the United Nations considers to be under the inferiority complex of Canadians to the Americans; however, with the same blow, they reveal the feeling of superiority last known to Canada.
As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian electorate in the election does not have Canadian-American relations in mind, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the Conservative government to enforce their 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more pictorial details than the mere substantial content to which you have to button.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period in which the federal election campaign was in full course, reports on the point at which the United Nations no longer participates in the efforts discussed by its political leaders.
To the surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador to Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various ways of explaining this situation.
“The Canadians’ almost-inhabited inferiority complex may cause Canadian, political leaders much more to talk about the internal issues of everyday life than the United States in this election to move the black Peter (as in 1988 in the Free Trade campaign)” he said.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus “the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of him.”
The ambassador understands this “hearing silence” so much less, as the two countries have high political and economic relations.
\"Logistically, he judged, \"it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party chief to lead such an essential relationship which the electorate has in mind as a key factor at the turn of the day.\"
The other expression of this feeling of importance is the communication sent by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa on January 22, 2009.
“Your journey will help ensure the government’s continued existence in the vote of confidence over the federal budget in early February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which has been created due to an experience program of $30 to $40 billion.
Nowhere did he mention that the government had to have challenged the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from falling out of the coalition and that the so-called continuation of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed relief programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008, by the Ambassador Wilkins, understands Washington’ increasingly negative image of the dramatic series broadcast over CBC by the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Borders, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle plays can be observed to Maher Arar, the No-Fly List, or also distractions for the purpose of muscle prots of the CIA.
Another report reports in detail on how Hillary Clinten asked her French colleague Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting if Europe was willing to capture certain captives from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual ‘fall by case’ decision.
At the end of the meeting, he described it as \"he had handed out to the Secretary of State a paper in the puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim Canadian origin.\"
\"The Secretary of State has promised to review the act again.\"
Finally, we note that the mothers heat up with regard to the website WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close adviser, had explained through CBC that the \"suspending\" for this massive leak.
He had referred here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan to renew lighting
The UN proposed a plan yesterday in Cancun to increase the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCKW), which corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction that needs to be realized in order to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction obligations of the industrial countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKWs spent on the earth due to the lighting, if the white-flowering pearls, which are still a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were to be replaced by fluorescent or even better, by light diodes (LED).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the world’s driving park.
Last year, in Copenhagen, the large exhaust gas emissions, such as the United States, China, Europe, and others, including Canada, were committed to voluntary reduction plans, which were to screw down the global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, from this balance sheet, it was necessary to pull off 5 Gt to stabilize climate rise by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 to prevent it from being out of control.
In the white-flowering pearls, 95% of the energy in the form of heat escapes, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with the new LED light bulbs, this energy demand is reduced again by twice.
The compact light bulbs hold between 6000 and 10,000 hours in cross-section.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those marketed by the manufacturer Philips this week - this society has participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-flowered bulb, which provides an indication of the savings possibilities of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that ice completely new bulbs release very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact light bulbs have reserves, since they contain mercury and therefore need to be disposed of as a special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the producers provide an acceptance point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact light bulb, but rather the coal power plants that emit substantially more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-flooded bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the profits that every country would generate thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars annually when purchasing electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power plants, whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast expects exciting announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the “unfavourable” publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election immediately after its deadline.
“The Secretary-General underlines the need of the independent electoral commission to get their work and announce the preliminary results without further delay,” a press spokesperson for the UN Chief.
\"He asks all parties and institutions of the Côte d'Ivoire to prove their responsibility and to include each initiative until the announcement of preliminary results -
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the electoral commission had to leave the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the end of the period, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would \"continue working\" to announce the results.
On Wednesday many calls from all over the world have become loud, but the CEI may finally call out the name of the winner of the second round of election under the laurent Gbagbo and its opponents Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, accounts for the cancellation of \"deceitful\" vote-offs in the north by the Constitutional Council, which were achieved by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, leader of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the UN’s practicing maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred President’s supporters from going to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo contestants now believe that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north who disagrees with the ex-rebels, asked the delay in announcing the results of the election as \"unacceptable\" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he had not gone so far as to challenge the victory.
His alliance parties affirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and submit a complaint before the Constitutional Court after the election commission has been prevented from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the coronation of the union and reconciliation process of a country that had been split into two parts for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivory Coast politicians that they could be held responsible for any possible outings.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of elections on October 31 with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as a top candidate.
The unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is, within the meaning of the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolitan area at a stable 9.3% (including the overseas department at 9.7%), the provisional seasonally adjusted information published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insea.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2,631 million.
The second quarter was reported to be 9.3% of the working population in the metropolitan area and 9.7%, including the overseas department.
Over the year, the unemployment rate recorded an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
In the third quarter, however, 3.4 million people employed by the French metropolis were not employed, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were able to use every two weeks or not or whether they were job-seekers or not.
The situation of the young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolitan area (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points per year) and 25% under the inclusion of the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed according to the IAA.
The seniors, on their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolitan area (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of over 50-year-olds, 6.6% under the accession of the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49-year-olds could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolitan (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over a year) and 8.8% in France overall.
After a dispute over its calculation procedures, the Statistische Bundesamt Insee has since 2006 no longer published monthly unemployment rates.
On the other hand, the statistical office of the European Union continues in this method and on Tuesday announced a 9.8% quota in France for October (including overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal firm and brother of the President-in-chief of the Bouches-du-Rhône (PS) region, was initiated an investigation procedure and he was sent to Luynes Prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in a public and fraud-provence investigation procedure.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with subjugation of social assets, distrust of general goods, greediness, co-optcy in corruption, unauthorized bribery and gun ownership, according to his lawyer.
“Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and has to deal with all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him, rather than spreading brainaches,” he said.
“It’s easy to submit a series of punishable charges to him, another thing is to prove it,” his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (parti socialist) in the department, had made it clear that before his hearing, the judge had a memoradum to his justification by means of his lawyers.
A member of the Guérinis, Philippe Rapezi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to law lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his deposit he had to lead.
With regard to the business competence area or the destination of the associated funds, he would never have known, Simon said.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne Balling Area, was also charged on Wednesday with discrimination and complicity, but then under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
“My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that had been accused of him.
“The leading prosecutor has taken into account not to rob him of his freedom, his lawyer Yann Arnoux said.
Four more people were charged and released from prison on Tuesday night, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy manager of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is courteously persecuted because of “unauthorized influence and passive bribery”.
Two State officials of the Aubagne Balling Area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one of whom was arrested because of the title of “Hentration and Dishonesty of General Goods by a public service officer - the other because of “Secretary in Dishonesty of Public Money”
Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti's life-threatening companion, has also been charged with \"healing and subjugation of social assets.\"
Those facing Guérini include Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of fraudulent public machinations that had affected Corsica.
The fans suspected his society to have contributed to the washing of money from “high” criminal circles.
The investigation against X on the grounds of alleged fraud in the granting of public orders, in particular in the disposal branch, is carried out in April 2009 as a result of anonymous writing in the files of several open investigation procedures.
The investigation focuses on the conditions of the addition and the operation of a deposit in La Ciotat, which also refers to waste from the area of the Aubagne, as well as from certain cities of the city's entry area Marseille (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its middle function for Syria
In more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher held in Iran for spying, breathed the French public, put the diplomacy into alertness and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
This is all under the attention of the diplomats of the United States.
The documents received by WikiLeaks and published by the newspaper “Le Monde” give some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained to the Americans its strategy, which went so far as to give this advice on dealing with her own crisis of “betrayals” in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They point out how the French responsible tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French did not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner held in France and sought by the American justice for the benefit of Iranian nuclear program based on trade in material.
Finally, they put the way with which the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a gruesome light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat telegram edited on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title “Iran: French Comments on the Way of Dealing With Hierarchies”
François Richier, Elysée-Advisor in Strategy issues, was in the company of Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle Orient with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method.
They urged Americans to put everything in place to bring back their own citizens who would be violently detained in Iran.
“Might noise,” they said, “articulated loudly and clearly and without neglect, the words “founder rights” — innocence — immediate release — in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
“Do this all the more, especially if the Iranians ask you not to do so.”
Because “Stilly, nothing solves — past the discussions about inconspicuous ways that are Iranians — champions in austerity maneuvers.
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a \"perpetual Iranian tactic\": \"Separation for the purpose of political extortion\".
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which should come on 16 August, on the day she flees to the French Embassy) \"requires the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians\" (230,000 euros of bail).
And he leaves it to be explained that Elysée anticipates further hostages, a phenomenon that \"will be sharpened\"
“The Iranians could, in the near future, arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but will continue to be held in Iran.
An information was circulated: Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States demands for illegal trade with sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from detention after a judge's decision in Paris.
Like many other observers, the U.S. Embassy is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, who pursues illegal Iranian networks of acquisition from the material provided for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand represents a bad novelty.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The Liberation of Iran against the French?
On the occasion of a resurgence with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only “much surprised by the judge’s decision,” but also tried to resist it.
“There has been a rain exchange between the French Bureau and the French Justice Minister (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but “the French government cannot change the judicial decision,” he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under the “stretcher” supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée consultant chooses a phone number, re-records, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian, who is currently in the buildings run by the Iranian Embassy in Paris.
While aware of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée is not prepared to make his efforts to \"play an important and influential medium role\" by means of revelations and media-organized \"immediate attempts\" by Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad.
Americans do not observe this activity without irony and state that manipulation bears fruit as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A Telegram dated 25 August 2009, \"the media blitz of the French authorities\".
Based on so much “thanks testimony” to Mr Assad, the Paris Embassy asks.
“Despite their statements of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did,” he said.
The document then deals with the reasons that the Elysée has caused this fiction to fall.
The intense communication efforts aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria, he analyzes.
A 2008 policy, which at the time was seen as early and unearned by numerous critics in France as well as abroad, has been launched.
\"The Syrian role building up - trying to lead Paris - Syria to what engagement can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region\"
The aim is also to say, “Third between Syria and Iran”
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11th, François Richier told her: “Of course, we don’t know if the Syrians have done anything at all.”
“But we thanked them in spite of everything,” he said.
“This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians.
Clotilde Reiss will return to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in Elysée.
In a communion he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their “active role in favour of the release of our countrymen”
No online games for young Koreans by midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called ‘the ash wedding’ which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking them from access, so government responsibilities.
A bill designed to encourage online game operators to deny young people under 16 years of age after midnight access to these games will be submitted to Parliament in December, signed representatives of Cultus and Family Ministries.
“Many children play these games all night and then have trouble learning in school and also with leading a normal life day-to-day.
“We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, with this bill, the Prime Officer of the French Press Agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will be accessible again from 6 a.m. in the morning.
The manufacturers had a year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government has also taken note to ask the manufacturers to screw down the time limit granted daily for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, the controller added.
He will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most “crosslinked” countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in worldwide online game competitions.
South Korea has won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games over 58 other nations in November.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the founder country
On Thursday, the FIFA Executive Committee will appoint the founder countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Championships, a top political choice in which the ranking for influence and lobbying threatens to push the technical criteria in the background.
One thing, however, is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA’s royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional Hochburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgien).
The 2022 issue will then fall slightly more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Katar, Australia) for itself after the premiere in the African continent in 2010, or to continue pursuing its branch in the United States or in Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch government chief, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political commitment of a world championship.
So the machining behind the scenes threatened to stop until the last minute.
It's hard to put up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA’s evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) act offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so weighty for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the hour of the election.
The Sunday Times, which with the introduction of the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temariii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, could well have ruined the chances for their own country, the weigh of football, which only once had the opportunity to win the World Championship, in 1966.
The BBC had again given the feeding ground on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report that underscoring three influential members of the Committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to anger FIFA and embarrass the English responsible, who had mainly run intensive lobbying with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government hopes for a re-position of the chess train that was succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intense effort be sufficient to re-upbuild the Image of England before the Committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the Duo Spain-Portugal does not lack any debris with its already completed stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympics 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could weaken their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the British, as well as the doubt about Solvenz Spain and Portugal have raised the chances of Russia becoming a weighty outsider despite its gaps in the U.S. (Stasia, Hotels, Transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided that the undisputed indication of the English press’s views on \"an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote\" has been raised by committee members.
“You’re throwing them up with trash, you’re trying to compromise them,” Putin refused.
For 2022, the United States appears to be the logical favorites, strengthened by the 1994 experience.
First economic world power, seat of FIFA capital sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages towards Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new candidacies seem to be early for two countries that co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA’s hotly sought-after willingness of the World Cup 2026 for China, which will cause the Asian chances to fall to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, with the prospect of futuristic stadiums all registering, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries are at a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weaknesses of television rights acquired by the European countries, the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: the disclosure
The Gaulle had really stopped.
In the middle of the night, he believed that he was suffocating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest delay.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be Ergo candidate in 2012.
But the revelation is not well on the side of the mystery that holds the presidential function.
So you have to do that as if the doubt existed for the first time.
In one, as in the other.
In 2006, the supporters Jacques Chiracs stated that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone that he would make his decision — somewhere in the fall of 2011.
The fact that on Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians, he would have the perspective of \"two mandates\" had spread a little fever.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President simply reminded us that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year-olds to just two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
“You have the worst of seven and a half years with me, or best of all,” he told them in July 2009.
For a new one in May 2010: “Don’t believe I don’t think about the phase after that.”
His words from before yesterday no longer make him a candidate, but also no less.
If they make comments, then for a two-fold reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the recording of the competition with Ségolène Royal, who drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which exhorts many members of the PS early on than accepted for combat ansage.
The bad polls on the other hand.
For the first time, the voters of the Right would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon, who by Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express survey).
“We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about it with the UMP,” responded immediately and cautiously to the Prime Minister’s environment.
“If he were to be a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate,” Jean-Pierre Raffarin told her.
\"He will always believe that he can win - corrects Alain Juppé, who has found himself with the revelation.
Euro: The ECB is forced to retain its purchases of State papers
The last meeting of the Central Bank Council of the ECB last year should offer opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional measures of monetary policy to come to their conclusion at the end of the year.
The crisis of the European state debt is committed, and the central bank in Frankfurt cannot afford to deal with even the present, more than tense situation on the European bond markets, in order not to cause their deterioration.
The political costs would be far too high.
The French Minister for Finance Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role taken by the Committee yesterday on the solution of Europe’s state budget debt.
She has not dared to say whether she believes that the central bank can do even more, for example by encouraging her program of purchasing State bonds.
“I reserve my considerations for my European trading partner (...).
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the Committee of the European Parliament, on the occasion of his hearing in Brussels on the occasion of the European Parliament's economic and monetary committee, did not seem to have much to be talking about his projects, but, rather, was pleased to point out that the programme of the purchase of state papers on the secondary market would \"re-operate\" and that we will see the decisions taken on Thursday -
Only certainty: The ECB will remain at 1% of its lead interest rate, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the debt purchases of the treasury were doubled from the ECB last week to approximately EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, they are expected to have made new purchases on Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
A total of 67 billion euros have been bought by the central banks of the euro system since May 2010.
Among the traders, the anticipation of a follow-up to the purchase course is not doubted (see page 29).
People no longer expect a remarkable change of course.
If the bond transactions of more than three months will have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter will still be able to make itself available to the unlimited funds reserves in a generous way, over a period of one week to three months.
Today, the people of the world are convinced that this measure will continue to expand by a few months.
“I can’t imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a substantial way.”
“In other words, it would be at risk of provocationing new tensions in a short time,” suggests Michael Schubert, the business manager.
“A progressive exit for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems to be more likely to me - antagonizes Norbert Bräms, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of their intervention in the market of state debt, the ECB would maintain such a volume of bonds that the worn market is experiencing, Norbert Bräms added.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of European banks on the markets of state debt in the eurozone, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
“She has to step on the market at any price to the investors of the lack of investors and act in such a way as to prevent the preoccupation over the returns paid to the weakest states — an important bond holder reported yesterday.
For if interest rates were set for high flight, states would be more likely to reduce their debt or just to stabilize it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government will go to Italy in coverage
After a week-long start for Italy, the situation has been a little relaxed yesterday with the decline of corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to the faithful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, regional leaders Giulio Tremonti had been able to qualify the situation as “undecidable” and had expected him to hear an “unpredictable” weekend, which the person was immediately dementing.
On Tuesday, the sheer rate of German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 basic points, and the prices of contracts covering the bankruptcy risk had increased to 263 points, which had resulted in a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi, with his Council of Ministers, pointed out that Spain’s discrepancy is at 400 basic points in the German interest rates.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed concern about the \"market turbulences\" and a potential risk of infection from Ireland.
The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland.
“The bad novelty is that Italy is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at the Hudson Institute.
In the clear text, that is, its problem is the absence of economic growth and the resulting, fast-paced tax inputs that threaten the state to be unable to meet its financial needs.
The last Brussels forecast was a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 will be expected, although the budget for the examination at the Senate accounts for 1.3% or 2%.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission will calculate the budget deficit next year by 4.3% of GDP (as opposed to the 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (as opposed to 2.7%).
Therefore, the rioter is also a new household collective, which could be used to a sum of EUR 7 billion after the holidays.
“If necessary, new savings measures must be taken,” says business auditor Olli Rehn.
At the hour, Italy will receive support from international institutions.
\"The fundamentals of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time - assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at IMF.
“At the moment, there are no problems, neither in short-term nor in the long-term, since, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.R.), Italy requires lower stability progress than from other countries — Pier Carlo Padoan, chief executive officer of the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a distrust of the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the preferred elections could be organized at the end of March.
It is therefore a little favorable period for a decision-making decision regarding a severe crisis.
European thinking on the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde said: “I think it has been proven on Sunday afternoon and evening: Europeans keep clear together, are ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area.
Although completely relative - yesterday's withdrawal in the interest rates of the European state bonds was water on the mills of the governments and the Committee.
However, from a beginning of normalization cannot be the talk.
The Rating Agency Standard & Poor's had announced it could reduce Portugal's debt notice, the most effective target disc of speculators today.
“As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political veracity, which especially burdens on the banking systems,” said exane BNP Paribas’ opinion.
Above all, especially “the political time is going to go much slower than that of the markets”
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger that lies in it, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already existing.
The informal consultation between the most directly concerned finance ministers and in a further sense with their opposite G20 will go well ahead.
And this is also true with regard to the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin beginning next week.
The Committee meets today.
On the plan is the release of unconventional measures to strengthen the countries of the eurozone in the crossroads of the markets (see below).
As regards the EU stability funds, its executive director Klaus Regling began his Asian tour on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in the Far East about developments in Europe.
If the objective of his visit is not explicitly fund-raising, he will certainly prepare the environment for it.
The first financial expenditure on the part of the EU stability fund will be provided for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative of the Reuters agency had entrusted the United States with a possible increase in the fund mobilised by the additional direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first row, are sending themselves to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are to be added to the savings, but are to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid embark on a different route than that of Greece and Ireland.
Both the one, and the other, is at every price to avoid having to ask for international assistance before they set up their own budget correction and decided on unprecedented structural reforms that will eventually bring them back to trust.
In turn, the European shareholders are talking about the options available to accelerate the normalization process of the markets of state bonds.
Axel Weber, who was on the pass in Paris on 24 November, had first expressed the idea that if the 750 mobilized billions of euros through Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not be enough, the Union would not hesitate to get back into its own pocket.
Barclays Capital’s public producers, with regard to the European state debt market, judge as a major actor, an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, “preferably” in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means that the European mechanism of financial stabilize, which is currently EUR 60 billion, is available.
A advice which has every opportunity to be carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are at the top of the market.
Snow and Glatteis: 24 Departments in Alarm Stage Orange
The snow episodes are still drawing traffic difficulties, especially in Brittany’s secondary transport networks, and are threatening to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in alarm stage Orange due to the threatening snow and glare risk.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in alarm stage Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow viewers dance the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow covers are expected from 2 to 5 cm, usually from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snowfalls are considerable enough to cause road barriers and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed for heavy traffic of over 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion traffic axes and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who are reluctant to use their own vehicle only in case of an emergency, and the use of some TER travel buses has been deleted throughout the day.
In the Picardie, school traffic was lifted for Thursday.
No specific limiting measures were provided for in heavy transport on Wednesday evening.
The Prefecture calls for the driver to be the most cautious on the streets and to adjust their driving behavior accordingly.
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) urged airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights from Roissy Airport and 10% of the flights from Orly due to the expected heavy snowfalls.
The DGAB recommends that flight passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airports in south London as well as Edinburgh, Scotland Airport are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
This is called to mind, in particular, the 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to guide the construction of the SGP, the state has called for a capital dotation of €4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to give some of the financial sum to their doubles in the markets.
Today, it has finally come to first counts.
The 2010 Supplementary Budget, passed by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly this morning, shall contain the measures provided for in order to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax on education and higher taxation of offices in Ile-de France.
Article 15 of the Law Act takes place in favour of the Société du Grand Paris.
“The product of this tax amounts to €117 million per year.
Second, a new order of the already existing corporate taxation: “to modernize it to increase its resulting product and to overreact to this increase in the Société du Grand Paris.”
How much would that bring in?
A puzzle.
This sum is not specified in the text.
Of the 4 billion you are far away.
“It is carried out that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion Euros of capital dotation that will be imposed by the state and that the Société du Grand Paris will be made gradually for the project — so the declaration must be taken.
In the SGP, this system is not at fault.
“Since the moment you spend income (the two taxes, that is, R.), you can cover the projection for over three years and then create out of the 4 billion.
“This is noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn.
The SGP claims that 2013 will start to note the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, the four promised billions of people will be able to look for a long time, is at risk of creating a fairly moving, parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Racism hackers and emsy spies
The affair WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one side, she has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relationships between the states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at an international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go ahead of the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each act created by a intelligence service (an x-like nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper cuts.
The “extremely” American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconis shed nothing more than what one could read over months anyway in any x-like journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the frighteningly caricatured profile Gaddafi’s offered cabaret artists for a long time.
The rule, which the secret practitioners may only consist of already known news, is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esotheric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Gral, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Temple or the Rosenkreuzler) is exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author does not want to publish any research on occult texts (but because he does not know where to find news about the non-existent) but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
The Secret Acts.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the chief of the secret service ( Otherwise he might be whatever, for example, editor of Libération), who only considers true what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, who sent the U.S. Embassy in Rome to the state dezernat, were the same as those who had already published Newsweek the week before.
So why was such a suspension made for the revelations of these principles?
On one side, those who know what each person formed already knows, namely, that the embassies - at least since the end of World War II and since then the chiefs of government can also call each other or take an airplane to meet at dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into espionage centers.
Any viewer of research films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore it.
However: the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy into a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-like hacker can approach the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is the substantial blow against the prestige of the state dezernate.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims than the “sharpen judges” in distress.
But we dedicate ourselves to the deep nature of what has happened.
Once, at Orwell's times, one could bundle all power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has since been able to prove itself as perfectly correct where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, any actuated transaction, the visited hotel, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you face what is happening today that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control path stops being one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - elected as the avenger of the citizen - can experience the secrets of power.
How, though, can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character Berlusconis or Merkels is basically a secret free of secretis, as it awards the public spheres; but in the style of WikiLeaks reveals that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, meaning to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks has not done Sarkozy or Merkel wrong, but instead Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this disability that has been added to such a tremendous power?
It is obvious that the states will no longer provide any reserved information online in the future - this would be similar to a slope attached to the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is in vain with the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state is moving on a plane and has contacted one of his colleagues.
In the future, how can certain relationships be maintained privately and only for certain ears?
I am very well aware that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I look at the government agents, secretly moving on uncontrollable march routes, carrying their communications nowhere but in mere memory with them, and also hiding the few written information they have received in shoe sales.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, Watergate’s spying attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing today like cancer, namely backward.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet rebuilt a telegraph with (phone) wire.
The (analogs) videocassettes allowed film researchers to explore a film band for tapes by playing from the back to the front and airing all the secrets of assembly, while the (numeric) CDs today do nothing but jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroportions.
The high-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes three and a half hours by plane including the transition.
It is therefore not extraordinary that policy and communication technology return to car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what was being maligned for secrets between the messages.
Currently, it is the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France beautifully talks about its financial promises
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the compliance with the quickly resolved financial promises (also called ‘fast start’ or early funding) that have been realized by developing countries.
And already the rough French beauties have been discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries have committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the basis of the opening of the COP16, the EU has drawn up all the registers to convince its partners of its commitment to fast-start financing: detailed action report of its Member States, press conference, major by-events, brochure distribution.
The operation transparency is remarkable and graded for its real value: the developing countries and civil society like to see it when all developed countries did the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces to have released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, bringing it to the right way to respect its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be “new and additional” in order to ensure that an additional use has been made without being sufficient for the disadvantage of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what “new and additional” means.
While the EU Commission proposed a delegation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the right value that he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen itself as a target for those of the year 2009: international funding will be maintained, and 150 million will be added to it for three years as part of the funding ‘fast start’.
Other countries have chosen similar guidance values, either with regard to year or with regard to conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France felt that the financing “all new projects” in 2010 were new and additional.
In other words, there are no guidelines for spending the preceding year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French aid for developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France is required to comply with its commitment to new and additional funding.
Another crucial element is the encryption in donations and loans.
In addition, there is no rule yet, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are € 1 loaned as equivalent to € 1 donated.
Obviously, this is only hard to represent: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to emissions reduction projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro that is taken as equivalent to a spent euro... In addition, only the costs of the loan for the capitalised country should be charged as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in mind than the following consideration: it \"respects - its commitment of 420 million euros by taking up 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and spending 8.5%) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including Slovakia) meet their obligations to 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends 1€ to fulfill its obligations, France will give just 10 cents and understand, among other things, a comparable use.
Good Hokuspocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast start funding with a double threshold: in part with a further development of the action over time and, on the other hand, with the reality of financial use.
France is able to believe that 420 million new and additional millions have been spent in line with its promises, saving EUR 36.1 million.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who had done the work) could have a double negative effect; once the EU internals (why do the other member states continue to make the donation if it is sufficient to lend it?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries can’t be completely deceived...
The chapter of early funding only has a small question of relatively short time compared to the overall discussion of climate.
But it could be the drop too much in UNFCCC’s massive machinery.
We hope that this will not be the case.
As always, it is indispensable to learn his lesson from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its form of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and equal justice with the other countries of the European Union.
However, in particular, France could bring forward the debate on the issue of long-term financing (another, crucial and currently discussed): one does not escape the question of “reliability” or the type of booking of its loans.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive with regard to the issues of dispute as it is with other things.
So hope is based on the new Minister of Environment Kosciusko-Morizet, who will meet in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast start of France and its vision of “reliability” as well as the use of loans would naturally raise from the international trust base that is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Générations Futures (formerly movement to protect rights and respect coming generations).
The association, which explains that its results — given the low number of analyzed samples — do not reflect a statistically significant value, but represent an illustration of the problem that was dealt with — between July and September — had usually bought food consumed by a approximately ten-year-old child in addition to an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals, including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day, have been examined as well as after-sales of laboratories looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other harmful substances.
The counter balance is low: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as potentially or probably cancer-stirringly classified and five as safe carziogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrinin disorder factor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
“Even if, in the near future of cases, the legal limits for any chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded, this survey is very well understood that the reality in which the drug may be exposed to cancer-repellent substances or substances with endocrinin disorder factors is a source of concern, the association notes.
Even during breakfast, the butter and the tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially cancerous residues and three proved safe as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an intermediate meal for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly forbidden in the EU.
In addition, the hack-steak, the tuna from the bushes, even the baguette and the rubber of pesticides and other chemical substances, were also spiked.
In the guidance water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
At dinner, the laugh-steak with 34 determined chemical residues was the “most abundant” and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unburdened.
The final risk of this 'damaging cocktail' for consumers is likely to be undervalued, the study said.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has, on the one hand, proposed \"against the urgency of the situation\" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the increase in civilisation diseases.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concerning the presence of residues 365 of various pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
