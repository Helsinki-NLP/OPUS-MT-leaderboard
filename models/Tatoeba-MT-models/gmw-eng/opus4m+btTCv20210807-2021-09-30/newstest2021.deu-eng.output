Biker reacts fast and prevents slummers
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the land road between Mechtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcycle driver was easily injured thanks to his quick response.
Car driver overlooks bikers

Mamming: Corona Mass Infection: 174 Harvest Helper Infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the low-bayer Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantines and are no longer allowed to leave the operation.
A security service monitors the exit ban.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were tested positive in the series investigation on the Corona-infector Sars-CoV-2, as the Dingolfing-Landau County Council announced on Saturday evening.
“In order to avoid further expansion, we unfortunately have to go this step to protect the population,” explains Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
In the past, seven employees had already infected themselves - this was the occasion of the series test.
The plant is a large vegetable garden that cultivates peanuts, gurks, coal and red bete - but only for insulating glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with a population of 3,300, not far from Dinkolfing with its big BMW work.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to maintain peace: “After our information, it’s a closed circle of people.
Infected on the court were separated from uninfected employees, the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
Green and SPD gave the state government co-responsibilities.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the accommodations of seasonal workers.
“This can be bitter when such local infectious events occur and regional lockdowns have to be arranged,” said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary director of the Greens.
This is quite similar to the SPD: “We have already requested a special control program for farmers with harvest assistants after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May,” said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
“The hygiene conditions in the workplace and the living conditions must be closely controlled from our point of view.
That obviously didn't happen -
The break-up came “with an answer.”

Report: Seehofer urges longer stock data storage
Stock data storage is currently suspended.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer, however, calls for a media report to extend the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of stock data after a media report - rather than for a half-year.
As the \"Picture on Sunday\" reports, Seehof's Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a quick legislative change in a letter.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to “put forward urgent adjustments in the law already in place,” the newspaper quoted from the letter.
The storage data storage is currently suspended.
A decision of the EuGH is expected to be made.
However, Seehofer wants the changes to be made so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, according to the report.
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it could only be checked meaningfully whether there would be a need for legal adjustments if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the domestic ministers of the countries, spoke out for a storage of stock data in June.
NBA: Strip Club Agers for Clippers Star Lou Williams
Annoyance in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), Los Angeles Clippers basketball professional, is to have left the tournament quaartier in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, he still visited the strip club \"Magic City\" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is supposed to have admitted to the visit according to ESPN statement, is back in Isloation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
Its reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, \"Sweet Lou\" as he is called in the NBA has already expressed his love for these Wings.
The American wrote: \"Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Anm. d. R.) have the best Wings in the city -
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday on Twitter that the NBA Williams has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
Thus, the Clippers star misses the first two official matches after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season at its end.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finals starting on Friday night.
Söder expresses itself after mass infection to the corona layer
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced on Sunday a tea-free for large farms.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in Dinkolfing-Landau County has frightened authorities and policies.
Almost 500 harvest helpers from several countries are currently working at the large vegetable farm, over a third of which have been infected with the corona.
The courtyard is now under quarantene and is closed with a fence.
No one is allowed to leave the site, food is supplied.
The 3300 inhabitants of the municipality now offer free corona tests to the authorities.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Land Council has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the courtyard.
Confession of Nantes's alleged firefighter
“My client has shown himself co-operatively,” the lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defendant added: “He deeply regrets the actions, the confession was a release for him.”
His mandate was \"plowed by conscience bites and taken very much from the extent of destruction\"
In the case of a conviction, according to the prosecutor, ten years of imprisonment and a fine amounted to €150,000.
The Gothic Saint-Peter-and-Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged during a fire on Saturday past week.
The fire broke out in three places far apart from each other in the church.
Labor investigations hardened the suspicion of fire formation.
The suspect who was now incarcerated had been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man worked as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of violent invasion into the church, he quickly entered the lookout of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended considering the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
“German football should at least discuss conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts,” Greendel said.
He emphasized: “For the associations that can be dangerous to the former Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In so far as the debate is concerned, whether it is not necessary to break into clubs that want to break into this Phalanx to facilitate the integration of investors.
However, he has doubts as to whether it is in the German Football League that it is willing to allow majority participations prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
“It remains a legal risk of moving into a European internal market to the economic location of Bundesliga,” Greendel said.
The former DFB chief sees the danger that “the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga end only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but not lead to more tension in the championship.”
Even an equal distribution of TV resources will not achieve a crucial effect.
“The FC Bayern makes sales of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are so immense among the first three associations.
The other 15 associations have an average household of 130 million, the 58-year-old said.
Looking back over the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
“Leider has given it to people who have noticed this mistake and passed it on to the press instead of speaking to me about it,” Grindel said about the adoption of an expensive watch that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
“That has been very busy for me already,
The gift of approximately 11,000 euros had been received by a Ukrainian official.
“I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it,” Greendel said.
“With the ominous watch gift, I’ve been completely transparent and unscathed.
There were many of them in the DFB,
He never “made a hell out of the gift” assured the 58-year-old.
“This may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption,” he said.

Argentina rejects creditors' offer
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
\"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unjust - it was in an opinion.
“While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term gains of our creditors.
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable in the current conditions.
That is why Argentina calls on its private creditors to reject some of its demands of around US$66 billion (about €59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country is again threatening the state.
It would be the ninth payout in Argentine history.
Finally, the lenders had asked for higher interest rates on the state bonds and changes to some contract clause.
However, the Argentine government holds on to its last offer and is not ready for any further commitments.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power by around 10 percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to meet interest rates of US$503 million and was thrown into a limited payment drop.
Professionally arrived - private not yet
\"It's going super-good - this feature attracts Dr. Stefanie Kramer after their first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will join the succession of Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden Notariatsstelle.
Six weeks later, in early July, the doctoral lawyer took up the job, and the normal day business runs on full tours for a long time.
\"I still have to arrive at the moment - she explains in a conversation with the Rottal ad and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time has not enough to move the food point from Regensburg completely to egg fields, reports the birthed Dinkolfinger.
She is currently with her husband, who works in Regensburg as a judge on the land court, looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city.
At least, her husband has been able to apply for a short-term parental period to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 111⁄2 years old).
In order not to commute from Regensburg every day, they sometimes also have a stay at their parents in Dinkolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Growing up in the neighborhood, you have of course been the city of Eggenfelden for a long time.
When visiting on-site with her family in the past few months, she recently found out: “Eggenfelden is a beautiful little town.”
The more pleased she was that she had made the race in the selection process around the freeway.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional turnout, her home Lower Bavaria plays a central role: After studying in Passau, she completed her refereeship period and the 2nd state exam in Regensburg.
After several stations as Notarassesssorin, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unteralgäu and Regensburg, she also shouldered \"in addition to - the promotion in labor law\" - in 2012 she took her first place as Notarin in Rotthalmünster in Passau County.
In 2016, she went into parenting, and eventually the move to Regensburg followed.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notaries.
When the site was written out in Eggenfelden due to the near retirement of Lutz Feller, it saw the right time for full professional recovery, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation at the Notariatstalt, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has once again a praise for the chancellor’s team: “It’s going to be super-good.
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming displacement of the private food point.
In terms of kindergarten and cripple places, she has already contacted a local facility.
And if everything hits as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here too soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging regions of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not be even 20 percent filled to start a season in case of a fan return.

Usually, the arena in the district town at Bundesliga games captures a little more than 81,000 spectators.
In the ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic last season, the BVB per match had lost around four million euros.
The Cramer responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB hopes that, in addition to the normal spectator places, some of the approximately 4,000 places in the Hospitality area can also be opened: “It is of course a hit in the account when these revenues completely break away.”
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, all \"good advice is to take a stable page length for the first time\".
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-term jobs in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited,” Cramer said.
The Dortmund marketing chief praised the BVB professionals for their salary loss, which is to contribute to overcoming the crisis: “Of course, players know that their salary loss has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in Merchandising on short-term work.”

They are so small and so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothing and specifically make mini-winkels for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be by voice - \"and like--beautiful Berndt Urlesberger.

Born the idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation.
teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enriching of the lesson.
Even if, in the end, all interested parties agreed that the direct meeting in the theatre and stage room would offer additional travel, you can also see the potential for contact in the schools.
“If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could become an interesting addition to the game-playing process,” said director Winfried Tobias.

The film studio Warner Brothers took her under contract for seven years and brought her to the side of Eroll Flynn.
She turned eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of ‘To Each His Own’.
The film ran in Germany under the title “Motherherz”
Three years later the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's \"The Heiress\" (The Erbin).
Much recognition was also given to her as a neurotic eccentric in “The Dark Mirror” and “The Serpent Cave.”
Daphne du Maurier introduced her in 1952 for the lead role in filming her novel My Cousin Rachel.
The piece has become a global success.
With her long-time friend, Bette Davis, she played in a “silver song for a body”
From marriage to writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953), the son Benjamin was born.
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage broke up too.
Rumours about an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
'Road to Timmendorf': Beachvolleyball: Thole/Wickler miss finals at Comeback
The WM-seconds Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the Beach Volleyball Tournament -Road to Timmendorf.
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they submitted their national team teammate Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Last year, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final match at the Rhein, her bezwinger Ehlers/Flügen against the surprise team Lukas Pfrestschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde scored a defeat with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand in early September: The tickets secured Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz Rauswurf from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of 'Feigenblatt'
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a \"feat leaf\" from the FDP and nothing changes the character of the party.
“The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremes in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD,” said FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Court of Justice of the AfD had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiations, which the federal board had mostly decided in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburg Landtag.
“If the AfD were really about to consistently remove right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have long been excluded,” Strasser said.
“There is no political will in the AfD, however, because right extremism is now part of the party.
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: \"That Andreas Kalbitz is now out of control, says nothing and changes nothing - he said the \"world on Sunday\"
Rather, it speaks volumes on how many French supporters still have a right-wing extreme in the middle of the AfD.
Blume assumes that the AfD will land again under five percent in elections in the future.
\"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered -
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the officially disbanded \"Björn\" to the Thuringian AfD Country and Group Chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection provided the strangle as a \"secured right-wing extremist effort\".
In May, the AfD government had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz did not specify a former membership in the now banned right-wing “home-wing German Youth” (HDJ) and the Republicans when he entered the party.
Kalbitz contests membership in HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing group in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also emphasized that the Federal Court’s decision did not change the character of the AfD: “The Wolf has only eaten creed.
The AfD remains a right-wing party, whether with or without Kalbitz.
This decision will not weaken the federal party or the right wing.
“The maneuver of the Meuthen Force can be seen.
One wants to escape further observation through constitutional protection and try to get through under the radar, Walter said.
“The AFD will not let go the spirits she called.
A noise throw has not changed yet,” said the Brandenburger SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn in the Kalbitz case.
“Here the AfD-Landesverband and the Group held to its right-wing leader to this day.
The legal dispute over the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
This announced on Saturday that he will now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Court of Justice.
North Sea wind farms provide good 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year 11,51 Terawatt-hours of electricity, the wind power stations on the German North Sea have fed into the grid.
That’s good 21 percent more than in the same period of the year, network operator Tennet said in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea power to mainland and the transmission through the German power grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's network area, have fed further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
In total, the wind current from the North and Baltic Sea thus reaches 13.73 TWh, compared to well over 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest on the sea accounts for almost 19 percent of the entire wind stream in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind power results from higher production capacity in addition to the wind conditions, as new wind farms have gone to the network over the past 12 months.
If the 1270 wind power stations in the North Sea all run at the same time with full power, they could generate atmospheric 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; it is, according to Tennet, 7.1 gigawatt.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
“In Germany and the Netherlands, we invest up to 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections,” said Tennet business leader Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms can’t expand their capacity even at sea, but achieve about 40 percent.
This year’s record day is January 2 when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea windwheels produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
In this way, almost seven million households could be supplied with electricity.
Art \"Skirmish - an exhibition by Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstvereinsverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration of 130.
Gmünder Kunstverein's birthday: The exhibition opening \"Skirmish\" with works by Leipzig artist Christian Bold blew the usual frame after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual pursued dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the art club, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent delivered the band “Defenders of the Universe” on the southern grainhouse square.
North of the gallery, the “Sandtogether” Association engaged
Freital: Windbergfest for Corona
The Windberg Festival does not take place this year.
The city of Freital has dismissed the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people attended this city festival.
“We really didn’t make this decision easy, and, in the awareness of how hard it is for those involved to hope for the last minute, the mayor Uwe Rumberg (partisan).
“But in the end, we are responsible for the health of thousands of people as organizers here.
For if tens of thousands were to be flown to the site and into the fortress, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and a contact tracking could not be complied with in accordance with the current corona protection regulations.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a people’s feast.
In addition, the organizational and surveillance effort would disproportionately increase by one multiple.
Rumberg trusted next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the winter mountain festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of Sachsen from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Not to beat Dressur-Olympiasinger Werth in Achleiten
Achleiten - The six-time Olympian Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the Dressur Tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came on the weekend at four starts to four wins.
After winning a Grand Prix with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also unbeaten on Sunday at the Grand Prix Special and in the air.
At the 15-year-old Stute Weihegold, Werth was in special opposition to Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on Sunday.
Even in the backyard, the German was on Quantaz on Saturday before her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winner horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The world's most successful dressmaker is to establish the ten-year hengst in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first cure at all.
At the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all the important four exams.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More flight lots in Worms
The Wormser Hochschule goes on to air: The DFS Deutsche Flugssurung - founded a professorship for “Air Traffic Management”
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and started in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to allow the beginning of the study not only in the summer but also in the winter semester.
Thus, twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacity of both the university and the flight insurance academy of the DFS are uniformly charged.
The DFS will advise the university in the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
Represented at the University since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been in the course of their training for flight piloting at the University of Worms in the course of Air Traffic Management.
This year, nine students started.
So far, the experience of the DFS is very positive, the performance of the students is excellent.
The combination of study and Lotsian training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the Lotsian profession.
“At these times, economic promotion is not easy.
However, we firmly expect flight traffic to recover and grow again in the long run.
In order to be able to fulfill our legal mandate, we need highly qualified staff in the future - says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, chairman of the DFS when signing the contract.
“For the DFS, foundation professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide flight slots with a broad, cross-border knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue good cooperation with the university and at the same time undermine our attractiveness as an employer.
This also underscores Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, president of the University of Worms: “The foundation professorship forms an important bridge between science and economics.
With her, we would like to apply to the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugschutz as a practice partner for the dual bachelor's degree programme Air Traffic Management -
The confidence of German flight insurance is at the same time the motivation for the University of Worms and the obligation to further expand their teaching and research skills in the fields of air traffic.
In the use of tomorrow’s flight lots, the university with the first foundation professorship for a dual course of study can set very special highlights and innovative focus for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, Secretary of State at the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, stressed: “The University of Worms has a single position in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus in the field of air transport.
The current signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the high school profile -
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
Around 30 minutes, the A 45 highway was fully closed on Saturday afternoon towards Aschaffenburg, as after a traffic accident the rescue helicopters were in use.
A 76-year-old driver ran a Ford at 12.40 a.m. in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve and landed on the control board.
The impact caused the front airbags, the driver suffered slight injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old bee were supplied by the notoriety and the patient flew to a hospital following the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, police believe that there is no risk of life.
The damaged vehicle, at which a damage of about 2,000 euros was caused, had to be dropped.
Heal wants to check other industries according to meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Law enforcements are just ahead.
But are they right - and will they stay there?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) also aims to review other industries in accordance with the now planned strict rules against abuses in the meat industry.
“We will look at the industry industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary,” said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers are already warning against restricting working contracts in general.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the Fleischrieen Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to make a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Major battles should no longer be allowed to use foreign personnel in the event of slaughter, dismantling and meat processing.
This is intended to prohibit the use of labor contracts and loan workers there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said the dpa: “Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and work transfer if you don’t want to completely reject the economy”
Work contracts, for example, for wide areas of craft, the construction industry and plant construction, must be the basis for their value loss to customers.
“The failure of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument.
Heil assured: “My goal is not to ban labor contracts throughout the German economy.
Work contracts are meaningful.
“If an industrial company orders a craftsman to build a security plant, this is a very normal work contract.
The German meat industry holds a ban on work contracts and loan work only in its industry for constitutionally unlawful.
It cannot be explained why, in the case of the serving and packaging of cheese, there will be other working rights other than that of Wurst, it is said in an opinion on the legislative action plan as reported by the New Osnabrücker Zeitung (Saturday).
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would therefore rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Often Eastern European employees from factory contract companies worked in the industry after the results of a survey of the NRW Work Protection Administration, working part 16 hours a day.
They often had no breaks.
Salary was retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that for the meat industry, a relatively sharp law came into force in 2017.
But by means of “tricky constructions” these have been handled.
“Now there is a need to be laid down.”
The politician announced: “In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to decide in the Cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that not only concern the meat industry, for example, higher test rates for employment protection or clear criteria for Community housing.
The draft of the dpa includes amendments to the law on the protection of workers' rights in the meat industry as well as the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers more intensive controls necessary.
“I wish we could make even more controls in many supervisory areas: food control, animal protection, all possible, for example animal transports,” Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast “Brandenburg is currently
But more control is also needed for more staff.
Three deaths in the crash of ultra-light aircraft in Germany
When an ultra-light aircraft crashed on a multi-family home in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people were killed, according to police.
A child is easily injured.
Two more people were saved in the accident, said a spokesperson for the Wesel circuit.
A parachute was found at the accident site, police said.
The Rhineian Post reported calling on eyewitnesses that before the crash, the plane had collapsed with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
More details were not known at first.
Space of Frankfurt Opera Square is running peacefully
A week after the outings in Frankfurt, the space of the opera site at night is also peaceful on Sunday.
At last, a few dozen people remained in the square, but left him at 1:00 before the start of the closing hours.
The police have been in use since the early evening with numerous officials, all over the city a larger police command was to be seen.
For the first time this weekend from midnight, there was a ban on operation for the opera site on which it had come to Krawallen a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked out of the crowd of feasters with bottles.
At least five officers were injured after police raids, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday was also quiet.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 at Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday against 13.25 p.m.
She was brought to Kassel Hospital.
With heat-image cameras, the firefighter was looking for possible drivers.
According to police on the Federal Road 83, the woman was on her way to her place of residence, when her car came from previously unclear cause from the railway and crossed several times.
In order to save the crash, the firefighter had to cut the roof of the truck.
Since it was unclear whether anyone was in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was sought out by the rotary conductor with a heat-image camera.
The drone staff from Warburg, who also works with hot-screen cameras, was also ordered for personal search.
However, the forces found no one between the high corn plants.
The seriously injured person was transferred to Kasseler Klinikum with the rescue car.
Almost 50 forces of firefighter Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on the scene.
The Bundesstraße was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Masters in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record-champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world football team made the total 36th Scudetto of the club history with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before half time.
With 83 points, Turin, which did not reach the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, has two days before the season's end of Serie A, is no longer one-placed.
The table second Inter Milan is seven points back.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo met after a release variant with the last action.
A play by Miralem Pjanic evaluated the 35-year-old from the penalty space limit directly with a flat-ball (45.+7).
In opposition to the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in 2:0, after his shot, Federico Bernardeschi (67th).
This secures the smooth but crucial success.
The Foullfmeter shot to the Latte in the 89th minute may only have been properly narrated by Ronaldo himself with a view to the goal hunter's rating.
“It’s complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily - said coach Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the spiritual exploitation of his players was great, the Juve Coach said.
Because of the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
The lead at the table peak at the end of Juve was ultimately also to blame for the weakness of the competitors.
For in the eleven matches before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only five wins.
Whether or not Ronaldo will still be a goalkeeper king is questionable.
Because while the Portuguese superstar has reached 31 goals, the former Dortmundr Ciro Immobile, after its three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the table fourth Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, already has 34 hits on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski helped to win the title of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy holds the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
In the 2015/2016 season, the Argentines scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples.
In August, the \"Old Lady\" of Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus is in the eighth final of the Champions League, but must compete against Olympique Lyon on August 7 to win the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - All-threat penalties and court judgments, despite the fact that drivers continue to give gas at countless illegal races on the bath-weedeberg streets: Last year and for the first four months of this year, police in the south-west have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparisons for the years before, but the lawns are making the judicial authorities increasingly work: in 2018, the prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim were conducted a total of 155 investigation proceedings for illegal races, a year later, there were already 252 and 151 in the current year until the beginning of June.
The races were less concerned with organized events, as results from the Ministry of the Interior’s response to a request from the Landtag-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers were suddenly opposing each other or they had escaped the police - also this is shown as an illegal race.
Most of the time, German men were between 18 and 60 years of age.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases, the breeders are caught and also asked for cash: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 penalties have been pronounced.
However, there is no indication that the number of illegal car races actually increased.
Rather, because of the many tragic accidents and processes of past years, other motorists responded more sensitively than before and showed more often, a ministry spokesperson said.
The highway 8 is particularly popular at Rasern, where motorists are constantly brake out the traffic to give themselves space and use the free track for a race.
In last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, and three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular race track
On the A81, police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a pace limit, the lawn is attempted to brake out on the particularly affected section between the English and the Geisingen.
The most highly prized and elaborate sports and luxury cars often have Swiss characteristics, because the drivers for the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in the neighboring country leave for racing to Germany.
For the SPD, the pace limit should not be reduced to a few routes: “With a general pace limit of 130 hours we would create this problem on highways from the body,” says Martin Rivoir, the SPD Landtag Group’s transport expert.
“The helmet threshold for lawns would be significantly higher if you were not here and there to be legal with 200 miles and more on the way.
Rivoir holds less of enlightenment or image campaigns: “Who in such a way above all rules and not only his own life, but also the lives of other traffic users, is hardly accessible with reason.”
ADAC calls for more police intervention
On the other hand, the ADAC does not say: “We assume that Raser can’t be deterred from the pace limits,” says Holger Bach, Department Director of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It requires additional and also harder controls on the affected routes.
Not rare will be more painful and the following: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have been killed in the races nationwide, two of them innocent in a nightly crash in Stuttgart’s downtown and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men were scheduled to run a car.
One of the vehicles came off the street, bragged against a garden wall and stayed on the side, which killed 18-year-old cyclists.
21 other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, in the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, harsher penalties are not necessary: \"Legal action is not seen to be necessary to sanction illegal motor vehicle racing more harshly - it is said in the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.
Bluelight of July 23rd: Durable intruder steals drinks from imbiss

Ackermann sprints for victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
At the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour, Radprofi Pascal Ackermann won his second day win.
The 26-year-old palace of the Bora-hansgrohe team continued on the 109-mile-long section with a start and goal in Hermannstadt in mass sprint after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
They were season wins three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall score, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger continued.
The 26-year-old had decided to go for a mountain ride in the morning and thus took over the peak in the desert.
Only 104 drivers arrived at the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain season.
“I’m really happy to start the season restart with a win,” Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
“The sprint was really hectic,” said the 26-year-old.
300 meters ahead of the target, he simply attracted his sprint, and it also worked perfectly.
According to the rules of the UCI World Association, a corona test was carried out six days before the start of the race for all race participants and their companions.
During the entire tour, drivers and managers in isolated hygiene blasts were separated from the organization team as well as from the media.
Watchers at the start and goal were not allowed.
The Board of Directors gave instructions on lay reanimation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family house, a child (4) suddenly lay in the water while bathing.
According to firefighters, the emergency call went into effect just before 13:00 p.m.
“A management representative immediately gave instructions on lay reanimation,” said a firefighter.
The rescue forces in question took the resurgence measures a little later.
The child in danger of life was transported to the university with reanimation.
Why it crashed is unclear.
Police routinely recorded the investigation into the accident.
The firefighter: \"We're going out of a tragic accident in the apartment -
Nuremberg: Unapproved Tuning meeting - Police attack, 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and time-consuming over 1,000 people participated in a “Tuning meeting” on the parking lot of a furniture house on Saturday night.
The police implemented their announcement to strengthen control of such events.
On Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) it came to a big tuning meeting in Nuremberg’s southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Central French Police, an increased vehicle rise in the area of a large parking lot in the Ingolstadt road has been determined by the Nuremberg Transport Police at 22.30 p.m.
The police then took over a variety of vehicle controls.
Not long ago, the police had announced that they wanted to do more against so-called autoposers.
Illegal Tuning Meetings in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the “Scen”
The officials were at the top of 700 vehicles and about 1100 persons, the police balanced.
However, only a small portion of the \"autoposer\" and tune scene are assigned to this.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene came up with the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons located on the ground, it should be assumed that these were mainly those of show.
In addition, the majority of the present adhered to the applicable infection protection provisions, in particular the maintenance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth nose protection.
The local control measures were terminated by 1:00 p.m.
In total, in 10 vehicles, officials found such structural changes that the operating permit was released.
Four of these vehicles had to be maintained.
No car race
Illegal car racing did not exist.
“The Central French Police Bureau will continue to monitor the event and continue to carry out enhanced control measures, even in connection with the emergence of the public,” it said.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the company involved: “They have all the beautiful rims we can’t scratch,” Schrödinger said.
For this purpose, special tapes would be used.
Also, because the cars are wider, the company should be careful not to make any damage.
“The young people should finally get their cars back undamaged,” he said.
Working agency figures: 900 suspects for abuse in short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Labour (BA) is responsible for approximately 900 suspect cases of abuse in short-term workers' money, according to its own statement.
“This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies who have shown short-term work,” said Daniel Terzenbach, managing director of the “Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung” for the operational business.
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, many companies suddenly asked for short-term work, the BA had to respond quickly.
Usually, the test lasted up to three weeks.
“So much time was not available in this hot phase.
The more accurate we will look at the final accounts.
There will certainly be some more.
We are not naive and have a long breath.
Notices of abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to recognize abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA prepares for a possible insolvence wave in autumn.
“Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The estimates go apart, but we're going to take care of ourselves in case of the case and we're already training our employees in the work agencies for the processing of tenders on insolvence money.
The numbers are still inconceivable, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party dissolved in the New Garden
On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 20.48 a.m. by the Reviers of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the Foundation announced on PNN request.
The young people had left the park.
On Saturday evening, some youths in the New Garden would have played Rugby.
The show was sent by reviers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks.
In the foundation’s parks, there are always gatherings that do not comply with the Covid-19 bypass rules.
At the end of June, it came to a celebration with about 300 people at the Babelsberg Park, and a week later about 150 persons were celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without corona regulation, the parks are closed when the darkness breaks.
The storage on the show is prohibited according to parking order, there are few exceptions.
The Foundation has long complained that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln celebrated an illegal techno party at night to Sunday 5000 people.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass Tests after Corona outbreak in tourist location
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the national authorities in Linz.
There were more than 100 results in the evening.
Consequently, many of the infected young practitioners are in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourists were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The clock hour was set at 23 p.m.
\"There are there and then cancellations and cancellations - of bookings, said the chief of the Tourism Association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Guests have also arrived early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist town in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 nights last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections were publicly known.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the practitioners who had celebrated in several locals and might have been incarcerated there.
“We all like to do that in our youth,” he said to the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness to young employees for the dangers of Covid-19.
As of Saturday, hundreds of employees, vacationers and locals have been tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak awakens memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of corona expansion throughout Europe during the initial phase of the pandemic.
A total of more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The main focus of the new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the last day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured the third table place by a 2:0 (0:0) success against the direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to be pleased with the Europa League because the FC Chelsea was still passing and qualified as a fourth for the royal class.
In the battle against the decline, Aston was allowed to cheer Villa.
Manchester United went into leadership through a penitentiary of Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the afterplay time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) came to an end.
Chelsea, in the FC Bayern's Champions League eight final opponent, won with Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
“That means a lot to me,” said coach Frank Lampard, who in his first season as a Chelsea coach was also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal.
Chelsea’s victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who went past the Wolves with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started as a sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the distance with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for itself, but had to sit for a long time at West Ham United.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84th) resembles Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost at 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which scored three coaches in the season, goes off after five first league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could no longer save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
At the end one point was missing.
The FC Liverpool, which has been an English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp just barely missed the score record in English football with his team.
The best brand holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle leadership in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the match on Sunday for Liverpool.
“For this wonderful club, it was an extraordinary season,” said Torschüte van Dijk after the game, “that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard.\"
In the end, the Premier League boss may also be satisfied.
Due to the Coronavirus crisis, football operations in England had been interrupted from March 13 to June 17.
In the meantime, even a premature cancellation or a standout of the remaining games on neutral ground was discussed.
Finally, however, the season could be played without any special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
Israel’s protests against the chief of government of Netanyahu are becoming more and more violent.
During the night, there were violent fightings.
On the night of Sunday in Jerusalem, the Israeli police took action violently against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing Conservative government chief Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
The police, among other things, used water heaters to solve the announcement.
In total, according to media reports on Saturday evening, around 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's office.
They protested unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters struck drums, blew in horns, and called for Netanyahu to resign.
In addition, participants of an area demonstration that supported Netanyahu reported the news page “ynet”
Also in many other places in Israel, people demonstrated, including in front of the private villa of the chief of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested by police in the vicinity of Tel Aviv because he was suspected of spraying pepper spray from a driving car on demonstrators at the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The protester was easily injured at the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have recently been multiple demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The customers accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Finally, Netanyahu was criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Preservations are provided to him, among other things, pre-fast locks and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The Corona crisis has made the country's economy difficult.
The unemployment rate was more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has increased to always new record values.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter power on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A ride accident called for nine light injured on Saturday afternoon at the B58 near Ahlen.
A car driver was traveling with their two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
Police: “Probably she had suddenly brake because she wanted to turn off”
This must have been seen by the driver of a Mercedes transporter who was behind her, probably too late.
He pushed on the back of the car.
In the accident, three inmates were easily injured in the car and six in the transporter.
Several rescue cars took them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea borders border town after Corona suspect case
North Korea has seen a \"lighting success\" in its own measures to defend the coronavirus.
Now, for the first time, the country reports on a suspect case.
Because of a first official corona suspect in the country, North Korea, out of fear of a disaster, has completely shut down a big city.
Despite the most severe epidemiological defense measures over the past six months, “the malicious virus could have been dragged into the country,” the state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the state of emergency has been imposed.
Communist leadership called for the highest level of alarm.
Should the suspect confirm, it would be the first official infection case with Sars-CoV-2 in the country fired.
North Korea has not previously registered any infection, according to its own data, and has described its defense measures as “lighting success.”
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reported to have been found in the reports of a \"outbreaker\" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person resigned to South Korea three years ago and has now returned to the border.
There was no confirmation for the border crossing within the four-mile-wide and mostly still-reinforced military buffer zone from South Korea at first.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea’s military has raised the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
There were investigations into some people.
According to North Korea’s own information on Saturday due to the suspect case, a emergency meeting of the Labour Party’s political office under the presidency of CEO Kim Jong Un was held.
The “dangerous situation in Kaesong could cause a deadly and destructive disaster”
Kim has already arranged on Friday as a preventative measure to \"block Kaesong completely and isolate each district and region from others\" it continued.
The data subject, as well as all people in Kaesong who had been in contact with him, have been placed under quarantine.
The central military commission of the party is therefore to investigate the \"outbreak\" as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, to impose harsh penalties.
According to estimates, some 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Voltage before Council session: City east and noise protection are still facing major summer break
“In addition to environmental issues, the members of the Committee will also vote on the construction plan for the major project of downtown development-East,” said the Central Committee on Urban Press Release at the next council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 16.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of the Pforzheim Congress Centre.
In particular, the upgrade of the eastern city will be debated by the end of the debate.
The majority of these are, at last, even rejectable in individual committees, depending on the presence.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, trading, and IT) which is now out of citizenship and then developed by administration and community council to fail to prepare for nearly ten years now, criticized project opponents Reinhard Klein as a \"outstanding parliamentary opposition\" - \"undeterred\" - \"speculation\" - \"oppression\" - and \"conscious false statements\" -
“Everyone thinks it’s better to know it, so small, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim citizen list for a year.
In fact, after reading the contracts in this position, he said: “I know what I am talking about.”
The exit will make the city cheaper, the Technical Town Hall will be in opposition to statements made by the city administration by grants, whose existence small is convinced to renovate for €8.5 million.
The city will develop quite differently than forecasting in the town hall and on the side of the advocates from the economy.
The city by its own strength and not an investor: this is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED fraction, which also refuses the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schloßberg, the rental of the Ex-Thale for administrative areas and a smaller downtown design in the ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
In this way, the Municipal Council will, among other things, vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheimer population from health noise restrictions, caused by road traffic, including multiple pace reductions.
In a press release, the so-called Transport Club welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. The political responsible in the city, however, is not innocuous because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting the line bus traffic with thind clocks and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The City Council also agrees on the participation of the City of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
It is also on the agenda of accession to the Climate Protection Act of the State of Baden-Württemberg, the resetting of parental contributions in the urban children's day institutions and the application for admission to the Federal Smart City funding.
Citizens are welcome, but they need to monitor corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year delay, Tim Zimmermann will start on July 31 in his premier season in the ADAC GT Masters.
Before the league of super sports cars can take up the regular operation, the first test rides were started.
For Zimmermann, it was primarily about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from attacking his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first rounds on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
“There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season,” Zimmermann says.
“With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it really made a lot of fun.
Fun also had Zimmermann with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
The Netherlands has been experienced in GT sports for 25 years and has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
“I’m not a starter in motor sports, but every new series also brings new challenges with itself,” Zimmermann said.
“Steen and I understand blaringly and we have also made huge progress from session to session at the Lausitzring.
The GT Masters will also play their first race there - at the Lausitzring.
From 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will be raced through the lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 serial newcomers, knows the route.
In 2015, he was the last guest in the Motodrom.
“It worked fast and I had to get used to a little on the route,” says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen race community of Graf Zeppelin.
“The sound ring has many fast passes that you need to make optimally to be quick.”
How fast a carpenter really is, that turns out in two weeks.
“The teams, of course, are a little bit poker in the tests,” he says.
“In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring.
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely pushed calendar.
By the beginning of November, seven races were on.
Currently, no viewers will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at Nürburgring, ex-Formel-1 pilot Niko Hülkenberg will attack the GT-Lenkrad.
British Minister of Transport of Quarantene Decision cold caught
The British government’s decision to put Spain’s authorities under quarantines for two weeks after their return, according to press reports, has cold caught the country’s transport minister.
Thus, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home on Saturday decided to take the measure.
Because of the once again rising corona numbers in Spain, the Cabinet in London dropped the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantary charges is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so it will also have to be Shapps after his return to Quarantene.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are only on the day of their holiday, only from Saturday, August 1 and were not introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, is still considered one of the “safe countries” for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
“Numbered ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be hanged for holidayers Spain,” said the Labour deputy Diane Abbot.
“But obviously no one has made the effort to tell Grant Shapp’s report.”
Almost a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the exit of the strict exit locks, the infection rates in the country rise again.
Virologists are primarily responsible for nightlife for the new expansion.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in the UK.
From non-necessary trips to the Spanish mainland, the British government is currently dispensing, which, among British holidayers, are particularly popular canaries and balaries are excluded from this.
Since then, more than 272,000 infections have been recorded in Spain with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths.
Russia: Day of the Navy: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced on the day of the Navy in his country an equipment of warships with the most modern hypersonic weapons.
With these unique weapons in the world, the combat possibilities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
The Ministry of Defense also informed the Interfax agency of successful tests of the Zirkon hypersonic missile built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple sound speed of about 343 meters per second.
They are the weapons of the future.
Underwatertropedeo is being built
The building is also built on the atomicly able underwater torpedo Poseidon, it was called.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who was also driving a military boat, said that 40 new ships would serve in the individual fleets of the largest country of the earth alone this year.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy protected Russia reliably, said Putin during the day celebrated by Matrosen nationwide.
In many other Russian coastal areas too, the naval forces began the day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia fights on the side of mighty Baschar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
There, ammunition was also fired.
In a video published by the Ministry of Defense, not only were warships, including a submarine, but also fighter helicopters and jets.
Hurricane “Hanna” reaches Texas: Helping because of Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has hit the country in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds, and violent rainfall now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. Climate Authority NOAA announced on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott called for the state of emergency for numerous districts.
The Texas-scattering corona pandemic makes the work of the helpers more difficult, Abbott said, according to U.S. media.
Evacuated for caution
“Every hurricane is a huge challenge,” Abbott said, according to the newspaper Houston Chronicle.
With a view to the vertebral storm in Texas, he added: “This challenge is complicated and is still sharpened when you consider that it is fought by an area that is the strongest area in the state affected by Covid-19.”
According to Johns-Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas since the Corona pandemic.
Abbot called on people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not ignore practices that we have used to, such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to the CBS.
It is important to keep all distance.
For this reason, hotel rooms have also been provided in some places.
Also tested in emergency accommodations on Corona.
Damages were initially reported only from the coastal city of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning recovered
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, “Hanna” was hit by the authorities on the island of Padre Island just off the Texan coast on land.
The tropical storm had previously been raised to the hurricane of the lowest level.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning was first adopted and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening, while “Hanna” continued to move to the interior of the country and to the north-east of Mexico.
\"Douglas - Moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane (Douglas) was on the night on Sunday at wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour in the direction of Hawaii.
However, the hurricane center expected him to continue weakening.
According to the forecast, he is to be near Hawaii’s largest islands on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an over average active hurricane season this year following a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes were expected, up to six of which could become very strong storms, the authority had declared.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, which one under an average of only 10 percent, it was then called.
US President Donald Trump wrote via Twitter that his government was closely observing the storms and was in touch with the affected states.
Four Gates Approved: Video Assistant - Punishment - Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic were equal two goals
Naples - Four goals achieved, four goals abated: Sassuolo Calcio experienced at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A a raven black evening - and was quite sour on the video assistants of the conference.
“A festival not given gates for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so hard against a team - commenting on the “Corriere dello sport”
Host Naples was led by a gate of outside defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in which 32nd minute Philipp Djuricic first cheered up the compensation.
The video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the hit back because of an absence position.
Five minutes later, Djuricicic shot the ball again in the net - the PAR attacked again.
The goals of attackers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) were also taken back by the judge team, according to the doctor’s report.
In the afternoon, Allan made the 2:0 final stand for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
“The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology provides records - writes the \"Gazzetta dello Sport\"
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start in the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick recovered after the first team training, as he can rebuild his successful defence after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has been behind Captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich for the third-most set minutes, suffered a band injury at the left foot root and threatens to be missing in crucial king-class doubles.
In the Münchner Schmullwetter, the defender broke off a training game and was driven off the pitch with a golf cart.
How long the undisclosed tribal player must pause in the fight for the title is open.
An inning in the eighth-final match against FC Chelsea on August 8 may be difficult for the final tournament to start in Lisbon on August 12th, the 24-year-old may hope.
The Bavarians don’t want to stop from misbehaving from training on Sunday.
Flick, in his personal triple formula, called the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on his way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to show its victorious title collectors in the following 28 days to the King-Class final game on August 23.
“We have just mastered the duty with championship and pokal.
Now it’s all about creating the special thing,” Flick said.
Until the Münchner can deal with the final tournament and a training camp at the Algarve in advance, the eighth-final match will stand against the FC Chelsea for the first time.
After the 3:0 play in front of the Corona break, the Londoners in the local arena should not become the Bayern album again as in the lost “finale dahoam” in 2012.
“We have to go through the door for the first time.
We want to win, create good conditions and thank you with a good game - Flick demanded.
A test of agreement is on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had a 13-day vacation after the Double, to a one-day August.
31 Players welcomed him on the Säbener Straße, including the new players around Leroy Sané, who for the first time met all new colleagues on the spot after his change from Manchester City.
“Leroy has been a good supporter like all new ones,” Flick reported.
However, instead of talking about the new season, if Sané & Co. are no longer allowed to compete, Flick prefers to talk about the current title project of the German Series Champion.
After days of individual and small group training, training is now in team strength for the Londoners, who are in contrast to the Flick ensemble in the game rhythm.
After that, the Munichers could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, and in the semi-finals, Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are potential opponents.
A way to the finale in Lisbon — not so easy — emphasized the chief coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The WM recorder-protector Klose and Flick know about so many common tournament preparations, which is particularly important in the 0-to-100 agreement.
With his current team, the work “a pleasure” praised Flick.
The focus on winning is an imposing essence of his team.
The tournament with Neuner teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
Of the performance carriers, all were there, including the forced Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay is not secured beyond the royal class season.
Formula 1 requires a special rule to shorten its world champions
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA needs to improve in order to grant the WM title.
All U.S. races were dismissed.
The race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more races have been added to the ten confirmed Grand Prix during the week.
In October, it was scheduled to travel at the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portimão in Portugal.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co., on the Italian tradition racetrack in Imola, fight for WM points.
As a result, the 2020 race calendar includes 13 runs after the current stand.
“We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in the completion of our plans for the 2020 season,” said Formula-1-Boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races are to be held in the king-class of motor sports during this extraordinary season.
The Formula 1 will finish their season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the officially peaked races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports could still appear in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulation requires races on three continents
The Regulation of Formula 1 requires at least race on three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents will be driven, there should be a world champion.
By means of a special rule, the FIA aims to award the title under appeal to - exceptional circumstances - due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be dismissed in the short term due to the corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not a matter.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Absorbing occurs in Brazil on criticism
Due to the tense corona situation, the races in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
“We look forward to being with them again in the next season,” Carey said.
The American race’s rejection was particularly critical in Brazil: “The rejection did not surprise us, but the reasons for this cannot be accepted,” said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
For example, infection rates in the São Paulo area are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams, not wanting to drive in Brazil, would also not justify abduction.
The security measures required must be prepared.
Greta Thunberg: Bad look at Donald Trump was about the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in Stephen Colbert's well-known late-night show by video switch and left in the interview what she had in mind at her meeting with Donald Trump.
Klimatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular U.S. latenight show.
She told me, among other things, about her struggle against the powerful of the world.
Also about her famous “bad look” at her encounter with Donald Trump, the teenager spoke.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has been taking an interest in the “Fridays For Future” movement.
Now in a well-known latenight show, she spoke about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Latenight moder Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your broadcast and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish.
It was not only about its fight against climate change, but also about its conflict with the powers of the world.
“There are some things that surprised me,” she said.
“How far people are going to distract the focus from the climate crisis,” she said.
“All from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children are going on the road, they’ve experienced it.
Head of state and leading politicians who mocked them in social media or even tried to silence them, she finds “disquieting” as they show the reactions “that they have no other answer to it.”
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw US President Trump in a bitter look.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her impressive view of the cameras was captured and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
From the short clip, a GIF, that is, an animated image, eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. president at this moment?
Stephen Colbert’s relatively open question answered, “To be honest, I don’t think that needs any further explanation.”
With the ready-to-beat answer, the experienced satirist Colbert probably hadn’t calculated and disappeared from the picture briefly laughing.
With her “how you” speech on the principles of climate protection, she remained in mind at the climate conference many.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile with Three Pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race around Europe’s Golden Shoe with Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski.
Former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile also has the best chance to become a goalkeeper king in the Italian football championship.
At 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, the former BVB professional contributed three hits, including two converted elf-meter in the post-game times of both.
As a result, the 30-year-old from the table-fourth has 34 season games on his account before the end - just as many achieved by FC Bayern Munich in the run-off Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo has so far reached 30 goals, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a backway ride: After a sudden climb with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply down the mountain and then slowly up again.
Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, drug-junkie, cult trailer: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
At the age of 73, he died peacefully in sleep, and family members told in an official opinion on Saturday that another opinion would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton honored Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a \"monumental loss\" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the longest legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamy instrumental hit is \"Albatross\"
The life of the musician The End of the Game - In The Skies - resembles a back-track ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
It should have been argued, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group for benevolent purposes.
He began to appear in broad garments and with great crucifix.
Mental problems should also have played a role.
Three years after the foundation, Green left the band in 1970.
It was followed by a social decline.
The bluesrock guitarist suffers from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in Psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the visual area.
He is to live on the road temporarily, work as a cemetery gardener and spend a long time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as a son of a Jewish working family in the district of Bethnal Green in London.
In his early years, he was thrilled with American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing professional guitar and was given five years later the chance to stand on stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Loaners.
A little later, he became a substitute for his idol Eric Clapton to the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the Blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967, together with his bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The Green composed song \"Albatross\" gave the group the first number-1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
However, the rapid rise soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not rape the mediarum, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: “The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs — the best thing was to land a number-1 hit.”
By the end of the decade, Green 1979 was a surprising success with a religiously inspired album.
Fleetwood Mac then swam without him in new formation on a successful wave.
Her 1977 album \"Rumours\" was sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite several small solo success, Green did not get a bigger comeback until he started a group of friendly musicians in 1996.
The British Daily Telegraph then spoke of a rock star returning to the earth.
Free of drugs, Green released some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts, he was a blues legend at the time of his life - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists in the past decades.
