Karratha police arrest 20-year-olds after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape police in Bilbao.
Transport police officers in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it as it left a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on the Burgess Road before turning off to the bushland where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponded to the driver’s description were later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police accuse a 20-year-old man of not being aware of a stop signal as well as careless driving.
He is due to appear before the Karratha Court on 23 September.
The motorcycle was guaranteed and seized for three months.

Return to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil rights.
“As trade unions die, the middle class jobs also die,” said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I am proud to present, together with the civil rights icon John Lewis, the employee authorization law.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions, as in other forms of discrimination, and thus stops anti-cooperative forces.
The addition of the National Labour Law Act to create a possibility for a discrimination-sustained worker to organize a union representation to complain in front of a civil court for justice - and to receive compensation or fines - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their bill proposed is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that the trade unions have endured in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries across the country — Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, extend and maintain labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press, and the right of union in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that ensured that militaryized autocraticism would replace Hedki Tojos with democracy.
In full awareness that the workers and their trade unions took a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that “the rights of the workers to union and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans introduced a clause that explicitly stated: “The right to establish associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements that restrict or aim to narrow it are null and void; targeted measures are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt took the presidency over the International Human Rights Commission, which designed the General Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other writers added a guarantee that “everyone has the right to form trade unions to protect or join them in their interests.”
For generations, Americans have accepted the fundamental principle that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union - and that this union would then have to be protected from collective negotiations as an equivalent partner with companies and government bodies.
After all these rights in America are under attack, it is actually very wise to re-examine the American ideal, therefore the working population must have the right to unite and to belong in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now all know that the labor movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation at an unimaginable production level.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
The story reminds us, and we should do that as well.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representation - has long been overwhelming.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past great and triggered the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporary law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana may be forced to close
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, the prosecutor said it would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics of the state.
This measure, which was passed by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June, to enter into law on the 1st Sept., would force doctors who conduct abortions to obtain a patient's right to receive a hospital's admission within a radius of 30 miles to obtain their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors may continue to perform legal abortions temporarily while applying for such a right.
“The prosecutors can continue to work in accordance with the law as they seek to gain these rights,” Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing will be made for the judge to make a more permanent decision for the law.
Abduction advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures, and said that doctors spent so much more time in order to obtain hospital injunction rights.
“Today’s decision means that the women in Louisiana are deprived of a law that seeks to take their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, who has been charged on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the complaint and had also requested injunction rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, where courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas that had forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
The American College of Eastern Retricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that injunction rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Exercising opponents oppose the fact that the measures serve to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only a doctor who conducts abortions in Louisiana has the right to enter a patient’s license, the Center for Reproduction Rights said.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to perform no more abortions, this doctor would, out of fear of his safety, no longer perform the operation, the group said.
In their argument against the judgment, representatives of the state of Louisiana said they would not punish doctors for the execution of abortions, while their requests would still be subject to patient injunction rights.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovary cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video homework for her mother online, which died of ovary cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovary cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, where ovary cancer was diagnosed in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
KLEINE STUDIE: New medicines could slow lung and ovary cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of egg-stock cancer, existing pre-borne diseases, as well as social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancers had advanced further at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, mortality risk was 20 percent higher during the study than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city died of higher chance of ovary cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible.
“This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and they are usually found in larger cities,” she said.
Despite improving telemedical services to counter the distances, as a possible remedy, they suggested strengthening the service of inflated doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said the study, regardless of geographical status, produced a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovary cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and precaution strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is now published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovary cancer.
Garden centers regret sinking homeowner numbers
The decline, along with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, could lead to the loss of tens of thousands of pounds per year of gardening, if today’s young consumers, according to a study by the HTA, reported in the Financial Times, reach the “Certain Age Group for Garden Products.”
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount spent by people with private homes for their garden.
The increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular procedure to asphaltize for parking purposes, and the sinking garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated £5 billion is implemented annually in sales.
In London, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is listed.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that humans cannot attract plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for the RHS said: “Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants on a move.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the \"golden age\" of garden retail due to increased home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to the better weather following unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergy Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1,000 protesters stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters back from PTV buildings.
The transmitter set up its operation for about 40 minutes, but now sends it back.
At the same time, some 3,000 protesters tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a mile away, they delivered pieces and stones equipped with security forces.
Police used tear gas.
The protesters called for Sharif's resignation, but he refused.
The country’s army now urges a political solution to the conflict, “without wasting time and using it without violence.”
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: “The army remains committed to ensuring the safety of the state.
The military plays an important role in Pakistan, and has already put more often.
Opposition politician Imran Khan proposes that Prime Minister Sharif have cheated in the parliamentary election last May.
The protests were escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters to advance to Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders U.S. diplomats for espionage reports
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has ordered the country’s oldest US diplomats to report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Vice Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former U.S. analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a main activity area for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all major countries were spying together.
An earlier report, which also had the most important secret service of Germany’s Ankara in sight, caused significantly worse reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Lokführer threatens with consequences for pendlers
The national warning strike on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The stand announced for 18 to 21 p.m. concerns all transport companies, including long distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main impact direction of the warning strike is the transport of goods.

said the District Chairman of the Trade Union of German Locomotive Leaders (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
Regional focus does not exist.
The main impact of the warning strike is the transport of goods.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced doing everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so it was hard to actually predict the consequences.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the Office of the Attorney of Mallorca.
The chief of police of Calvià on the island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption charges by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested after corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption charges and are questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners said the veteran economy of the authorities has serious impact on their businesses.
“It’s no longer about making money, it’s about survival,” one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our life base out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video in which an 18-year-old British tourist was shown performing on 24 men during a soup tour Fellatio.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the disorderly behavior of alcoholized holidayers in Magaluf by reducing the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-related knee tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the knee-tour organizer Carnage together must pay a fine of $55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British holidayers, is also known for several accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of “balconing” in people from one balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affected flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRUHLING has given South Australia a winter surprise, with fierce sights and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 21 a.m., another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen to Sunday in the night.
The last setback was the result of a series of short, stormy show, including a caster, which started just before 20 a.m. and provided almost 4mm adjustment in about 10 minutes.
After last week’s winter had provided for an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8°C.
The heavy weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Melbourne to Adelaide from Virgin Airlines.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 19.30, but was hit by a sharp wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start.
At this point, winds were about 50 km/h at the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to start on a second landing flight and finally set up at about 20.40 p.m.
The flight delay, as a result, led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is expected on Tuesday, with possible views.
Matthies says: Highest time for big networking
In view of the galloping technical progress that our comfortable home is threatening to turn into high-tech shell centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforted with an extremely familiar electronic accessories.
While I write this here, my view of the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind this: if the cable were not, all the listeners would fly around in the house in the shortest time, and that would be even more retro.
Does it apply to ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, tip failure: electronic) sector the rule that today’s world newness is tomorrow’s electric debris, bought - is obsolete.
And who today, for example, still has a tube TV in the living room, he simply says that he rejects television in principle.
Why this consideration?
Because the pressure of the Ifa on the radio tower this week once again leads us to face our absolute incompetence in electronic issues.
The layman, who had blindly mastered past washing machine and CD players, today does not even grasp the purpose of the devices, which are spread out in front of him with an indescribably eitable expert speech: “Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies” promises the press office.
- Yeah, it's still going on?
What should you talk about with people who seem to be willing to spread such quark?
In fact, for about 20 years, it has been mainly about the fact that we are supposed to cross our house.
In order to order the yogurt itself, the fire alarmer will inform us on the Maldives during the holiday that it is burning in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we arrived from the office from the air conditioning on our quick arrival...?
Yes, but that does require air conditioning.
But a dream will soon come true: We lift our armband watch, say you loudly 'saugases' - and at home the dust suction butter goes off.
I'm wrong.
Everything runs out to nothing less than a revolution: “The boundaries between white and brown goods are swirling - an industry expert runs, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza still needs in the oven, but nothing benefits because we are in the dust.
From daily practice, we also know: If a new-mode device is used once it is really urgent, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
What is another reason that the spiral cable will survive the next radio exhibitions on the phone.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday, after spending the summer in air-security rooms, while missile and murder warrants went down on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the congregations drawn by rockets in southern Israel, but the signs of battles are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the Pashosh Kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, were out of the walls and sliding walls prior to the arrival of the students.
“We have a bit of fear, but are excited,” said Ronit Bart, a resident in the Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt “a bit comical” to go back to school suddenly.
“These were difficult times, and we didn’t go out of the house at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke the war last week, thousands of residents of the border communities, such as Saad, remained in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border, in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian killer grenade, still hesitated to return.
The Ministry of Education told us that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Her children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza, which is heavily drawn by the Palestinian Committee.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, “We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on an unlimited ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire provided an immediate end to the fighting; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas's demand for an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarming of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battles.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated to be Palestinians and the UN.
Israel argues this information and estimates that at least half of the casualties are fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and killer grenades during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
As tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and continue to fight, the educational authorities delayed last week the beginning of the school year.
“I hope the school will be opened soon so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy currently living in a school in Gaza City.
By election in Sachsen: CDU-Vize Strobl asks for NPD ban proceedings
In view of the NPD’s loss of votes in Saxony, CDU national vice Thomas Strobl has expressed itself for an end to the ongoing NPD ban process before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU national vice Thomas Strobl, the ongoing ban proceedings against the NPD should be brought to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
“The NPD cuts worse than the last time,” said Strobl, who is also CDU-Landschef in Baden-Württemberg, the ‘Leapty People’s Newspaper’.
This is an enjoyable development in the right direction and a development that will make me more likely to be able to fight the NPD politically, not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had nearly failed at the five-percent hurdle in voting on Sunday.
A first call for a ban on the right-wing party failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection at the time also had informants in the NPD.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long time of preparation.
The federal and federal parties did not join.
Harburg: Tents for New Refugees
In New Zealand, refugees are now being accommodated in tents.
The first collection for refugees in Harburg is made up of all the nutrients.
Now the internal authority has three tents of the Red Cross set up next to it.
District politicians were informed shortly before - they are not very excited.
“These Hauruck actions further call on citizens to stay with them and give the district politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in human housing of refugees,” says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Greens at the Harburger District Assembly.
Her party demands that the Harburg District Administration currently provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the filling up of the first collection are the response of the seeking ones - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in subsequent institutions.
Many refugees remain longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Homes in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data’s research director, Tim Lawless, told Sydney and Melbourne to drive a two-part market.
RP Data figures show that home prices in Sydney have increased by 16.1% last year, by 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices average by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by the cuts in state spending and where prices increase only by 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr Lawless further said that with the beginning of spring, it would now be to observe an increase in the real estate for the next few months, which would be subject to the market — a real test.
“If you consider the continuously high price of auction prices, a general rapid sales rate and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months,” he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts statements made by the managing director of Peer Medau and attests to this, like a field master.
The style of the university is not that, it says in the communication.
For example, the Medau family was already informed orally about the entrance to the university in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were not announced until July is definitely wrong, according to Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not “pre-settings or even decisions” but “preferences”.
The extension of the narrow road to the castle necessary for access is also less dramatic than fear of the Medaus.
From a nine-foot-wide road was and is not the talk.
It goes to the current level at 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than previously - explains Pötzl.
The argument of Medau operators that their free and school-based parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future will not allow Pötzl to apply.
Zugeparkt is not going to be at all because it can now be solved intelligently, as in other public parking spaces.
Think of the residents
The child cripple mountaineering, which is located on the site and would lead the entrance to the park deck before their doorway, is to be “not affected,” according to the university president.
Rather, he has to think, “that this is not only about the children’s crisis, but also about the residents at the mouth of the Friedrich-Streis-street and the 800 students of the neighboring real school.
This is a lot more than the partial interests of Mr. Medau - so Pötzl.
Whether or not the criticism of the parental counsel of the child cripple, with the expansion of the road, would be justified in losing a \"the few natural spots of Coburg's\"--the reader could decide for himself--
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Office, wants to inform the city councils about the structural development of the university by 2020 - and in this context address the importance of the new development -
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's crisis last week about the plans of the university.
Therefore, the access to the new park deck is not to be guided, as has been done over campus and Friedrich-Streis-Straße, but through the Medau-Berg.
This meant that the narrow road would have to be two-tracked at about one mile in length.
According to news reports by the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would be tenfold.
There are about 2,000 vehicles per day.
From the side of the city, you don’t want to talk about the project.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old member of the Bundesligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt led this decision, above all, to health problems.
The decision was not easy for me, it was matured over several months.
It’s time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team,” the 2007 World Champion announced on his Facebook page.
He thus goes into international retirement with a score of 167 country games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the throwing-back player for the Flensburg Champions League winner still wants to go on goal hunting for a few years, he is no longer available to the new Federal coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Islanden, which announced its framework for the national games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf launched a “long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches made me just as excited as my longtime co-players and followers will be.
But for my club, I also want to be well available in the next few years, for this, longer regeneration breaks are necessary that do not allow the current double load.
The left-hander had to fear his career end in 2012 after a versene infection.
Because of Achillessensänne, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone injection, which later caused a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass on any body without trace.
I have some health facilities that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot surgery that took place in short distances in 2012, I never got my blood pressure right into the handle.
To this end, there are some other wear-related complaints.
Even at the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I control my head, my body cannot deceive — Glandorf told the magazine “Handball Time” in the interview.
For a comeback, he would only be available in the absolute emergency.
“When all the pieces are torn, I’m always ready to talk,” the father of two told the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball at one hand.
I also have to say that after my long stay in the hospital in 2012, I have also become quite humbled with regard to my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least a few times.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League win, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup of Pokal winners with Flensburg.
German economy shrinked by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product decreased by 0.2% from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This informed the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed preliminary calculations.
The economy lived only in the spring, while the investments went back.
Foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual increase, a GDP-plus of 0.8 percent for the first half of the year results in a second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the \"Münsterland-Mooiste\" which led through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmann City of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch bike drivers on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, adopted the so-called \"Münsterlande-Mooiste -
It is the largest bike tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1,000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour through Münsterland.
This tour was offered in various journals.
We come from Den Helder and have been driving overnight to participate in this tour.
We also want to get to know Münsterland in this way once more - the cyclists are excited about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the Vereinsheim der Schützenbroderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small ‘peace drive’ through the city across the wall, where the start also took place.
Furthermore, the route, which was written for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz via the Schöppeninger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Bilderbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 altitude meters, 120 kilometers with 1475 altitude meters and 145 kilometers with 1775 altitude meters, cyclists proved their good condition.
They were engaged on their way to Havixbeck and Bilderbeck.
Chief organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayoral representative Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a great experience for all involved.
The organization left no problems and there were no negative incidents - Heinz Lölfing draws a positive side to this event.
Unfortunately, not many participants came as much as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecast and the morning rain.
“We will see each other again in 2015 with hopefully nice weather on August 30 or during another weekend, but the cyclists promise to return to Münster and the organizers plan a new issue.
Konstantin Wacker's unscrupulous, honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which has brought Konstantin Wecker, Liedermacher, Pacificist, politically safe activist, ex-keeper, to paper in \"Moons and Warriors\" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically but more thought-fitting for thought-fittings, the Municher, born on 1 June 1947, wrote down his memoirs, each chapter introduced by a suitable song text.
And he is absolutely honest: from the onanie as a gymnasist to the shop theft and drug consumption, he does not leave a human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Wide space also takes abstract but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the Now, spirituality - all that he tries to go on the ground, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how he not only characterized music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who, “by subtraction,” arises as he says, “by leaving everything unnecessary.”
However, there are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the high-level views: for example, over battleships in one of GI's frequent locations or a crazy car ride, where he frontalized a tree.
He is also totally honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into his arms.
I never said, “I love you.”
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with vivid tunes.
But Henry had to work through some difficult moments of childhood.
He visited “many” therapies after his mother’s death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: “Hear with the crack.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to look at Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had grown up when I was a child - went with him to the knees and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a cast in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he gained insight into how life might have been for him.
It's now a little brighter, but they're dark, dirty, deep rising labyrinthe with flames and smoke and lots of noise.
My father used to simply put himself in the corner and then one could hear him slowly as he started singing because he could wash the casting of himself.
When I was there, it became clear to me that he had done that for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew bigger.
However, Henry grew up as a child without the love of his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said, “I love you.”
Only when my mother was bad at the end of her life did we start saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop “I love you”?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why should we not be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a Diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, “You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness exercise and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's hard.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may appear in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since being praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been accepted by the theatre.
It followed The Comedy of Mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started at only 16 years of age when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. \"I was the only black Imitator/Comedian on TV for a pretty long time.
He learned in the profession.
I had to grow not only before the public's eyes, but also learn from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke story machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Because his manager had the right to stage at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which the people “swarted black” Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wish it would never have happened, but I don't regret that I have done it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this “year-round award-winning light column of British television” was also a “grotesque parody of black people”
Through the introduction of figures that ridiculed and celebrated the British black culture, Henry worked in the eighties on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show was broadcast in 1984, and in the nineties he was known, among other things, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentary, TV series and film roles marked his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought: “What do you do next, Len, because it feels like you’re just spending time or doing a little bit of time on the job,” he said.
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first follow was Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was regularly allergic.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and mostly thought he was in front of a middle class domain, whites in tight pants and a coal head.
So I was afraid of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, “You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few of the words into your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so.
Henry released 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was excited.
I felt I could do that.
It was almost as if someone was finally putting my head right.
“That’s why, it’s a serious thing, take them seriously, learn your text, research a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
You seem to expect a car accident, and that just didn’t happen.
He soon appeared in the comedy of error.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn’t believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, “Oh, you changed.”
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
“A little voice said to me, “You have to bridge now for 10 minutes while they are repairing the computer”
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from the stage and something in me said, “Oh, thank God!”
I'm not responsible for it.
I can leave it to someone else.
“You play in a play, so stay in your role.
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the sight.
This too came well, so it's like a great shield of the gods that tell me, \"This is your determination here.\"
He says this, of course, with a thunderous voice.
So I'll stay with you.
I really love it.
I love being in a sample room.
Henry, however, still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has gone through humorous breaks while he repeatedly imitates people.
I decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I find that kind of immediate satisfaction from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you’re always looking for it, you’re going to take it to a wall.
I sometimes act live in Apollo when I like it, but overall, I don’t have as much as before.
I ask him if he will ever make a stand-up comedy tour.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I want to give up that ever again.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis has called for civil disobedience in the capital capital.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets in Northern Ireland on Monday, said a spokesperson for the Huthi Party “Ansar Allah”
The access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reports a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper \"Yemen Post\", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the leaf, Huthi threatened with further escalation of the conflict, his demands should not be met.
The Shiite Huthis is fighting for more independence from Sunni-controlled Yemen and is demanding the resignation of the government.
The Huthi peoples have been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large railways of Northern Ireland.
In the surrounding country, there are always bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya Registers Officials to Indemn 'Geisterals'
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically to remove “spirits appointed” from government salary lists.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer pay for a government announcement.
The government suspects that thousands of people receive pay after their departure from public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service in 2013 when he came to office.
In a survey at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million ($700,000) per month was lost in payments for “spirit-occupied” and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital city of Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data about the biometric registrations is recorded in a government message.
All those who would not do this without a credible apology were removed from the salary list, the communication continued.
As a result of this process, it is essential to contribute to the socialisation of public service by determining the actual number of officials and also cleaning up the salary list at both levels of government - so the \"spirit workers\" are eliminated,\" said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal about the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be negotiated in court for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, call for 19.4 million euros of damages from Achenbach in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf Land Court and two of his companies, which are in bankruptcy proceedings.
This was announced by a court spokesman on Monday.
In the complaint it says that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of artworks and old-timers and calculated Berthold Albrecht higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission is also higher.
Achenbach purchased valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
For 44 years he was in school, 23 of which were schoolteachers.
From this time on, Manfred Richter knows many standing Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his efforts to see people in the student.
The snowhead is the most famous mountain of the giant terrain.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he was interested in the teacher's profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expelled.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
That's how the judge moved to the upper-ranking Senkendorf.
The teacher's education took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometers to the nearest train station six times a week, drive the train to Bamberg, cross the whole city and go to school there three kilometers in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter arrived in a Red Cross home in Bamberg and got a bedside: together with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory.
In 1951, he took the first and the second state exam after three years of teaching office officers.
Since Oberfranken had no free teaching position for him, he applied for Oberbayern and arrived at the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The “Frælin Room” was his first “service apartment” in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he entered a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and in Petershausen five.
From the 1968/69 school year these were put together in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only the primary school remained in place.
To escape a back grade in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew up, and so the children and their teachers from September 1982 were able to relate to today’s construction, which was expanded in 1997 after Judge’s retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of then Mayor Ludwig Götz, who, in addition to building a workshop at the municipal cost, and in the expansion of 1997 basement rooms, although this was not compatible with the guidelines for school buildings.
“Citizen Master Götz was very school-friendly, and the judge remembered gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter never forgot a government representative’s speech, who had responded to a school council referendum on law and justice: “You must never forget love, Manfred Richter put into practice what he had heard as a young teacher.
“You have to teach the children two things: roots and wings,” says the 84-year-old.
And he had to learn: “It doesn’t always work, whether it’s just his students or his own six children, it’s not clear.
In any case, judges were sometimes unconventional.
When students flogged, they didn’t get about a penalty job from him and were not vilified for retiring either.
At the expense of the community, judges had purchased two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two contestants come up against each other, even if there was to be a villain.
For the benefit of the school, judges as rector maintained a good relationship with then Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the partyless judge after his retirement to run at least as the last one on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
However, the judge was elected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists set up intermediate stops in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
If cyclists are fast on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scots, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, only the number of the Rastenden was impressed: the 700 participants of the hr4 cycle tour and companion tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free sky in the Scottish Alteburg Park.
Under the motto “Rattle and celebrate on newly discovered roads between Nidda and Kinzig,” the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday, where a concert by Van Baker & Band was held.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, which attacked 60 kilometers across Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Scotland.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who was in Bad Vilbel with the bike, and the director of his own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For refreshment of body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the rural women from Ranstadt and Lower Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, black, straw and cheese cake, which miraculously mingled the crafty cyclists.
“Such cakes can only be made for rural women,” he praised a participant from Aulendiebach while ordering another piece.
At the drinking level of the Geiß-Nidda Turnverein, cold refreshments could be achieved.
The “Duo Bravo” enjoyed visitors with well-known tunes from operats and musicals and reaped excited applause.
The beautiful atmosphere of the park was relaxing.
In addition, a man enjoyed a head massage from his partner: “He earned it, and finally he has already tied off bicycle chains today.”
At the same time, the mayor and the manager still had to work: they were interviewed at the fountain in front of the drink-curhouse by reporter Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Also, since the first hr4 race tour in 2004 as tour guide, the promotion chief Tobias Hagen had only recently been able to do so, but he had plenty to do with technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated by means of three phones and a radio device with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle staff of the police, wrote Facebook entries and made reporting messages, also needed a check.
“Most of the participants come from the Rhein-Main area,” he said, “but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have traveled.
The number of participants is aimed a bit at the available overnight capacity.
In Category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II in collections.
From the resort, the cyclists had a good impression when after a half-hours they re-entered: “Thrust”
\"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen - they got to the farewell.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to set up a short break.
But in the evening, the cyclists were asked to go to the idyllic Alteburg Park.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had a beautiful festival setting and, of course, had prepared deliciouss, such as flame cake with well-cooled spring white.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS business leader Markus Hoßfeld and MSC chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his position as board member of the ADAC Hesse-Thüringen welcomed visitors.
The three showed their joy over the “many business in Scotland”
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity for a fast movement under free sky was used with eagerness despite the sporty actuation on the bike.
Among the guests, there were increasing numbers of citizens who were as opposed to the good mood as the big scars of cyclists.
On the second day, for the cyclists, Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb stations, including a concert with the Trenkwalders, were on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes reentered Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for conspiracy against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey because of the suspicion of “suppression against the government,” local media agencies reported.
Police authorities did not give a direct comment.
Among the arresters are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they allegedly established an organized criminal association and raised phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist clergy Fethulla Güllen against him and others in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The entire Ukraine, a huge joint Ukrainian people’s front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, school principal in Slavjansk, who visited Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in future life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It takes pride in the glory of the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearson's media world.
She served as CEO of the Financial Times for seven years and returned when the parent company’s top post went to a younger male colleague.
Their discovery is estimated to amount to nearly £1 million.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended by Lord Browne, former president of BP, as he sought more private economic knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
As early as May, I described the president's task with a poisoned cup.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust acts in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This provides an almost untainable duopol, which requires a complete comprehensive reform.
But the newly-arriving president would risk joining in on everything and forming an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps doing his job himself.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that wasn’t enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money, and status.
While competition is getting closer and new technologies are threatening old, convenient security, the upcoming negotiations of license fees for the BBC are linked to particular dangers.
For the modest sum of £ 145.50 per year, the British public buys into the world’s largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: she says she reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 pence a day each.
And it seems that the BBC is rising up again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support them today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my cell phone today and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very loving and benign institution.
She needs a decent chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that deposing tweets were not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a deplorable comment about the democratic district state attorney, who is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of official force.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry’s user account, which violates the previous one.
Just a tweet has been sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
“I don’t approve of the tweet and have deleted it,” he said.
Perry employees did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who was actually serving the feed.
In the previous tweet, an unprofitable picture of Travis County district state attorney Rosemary Lemmberg was drawn, which was convicted of drunkness at the tax in April 2013.
Perry filed a veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to resign, leading to a charge against Perry - who might be a 2016 presidential candidate - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet reads: “I don’t always drive drunk with the triple allowed alcohol level ... but when I do, I complain to Governor Perry when he blazes it.”
I am the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the Grand Jury's investigation against Perry.
It was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of legal assistants appealed to the judge in the case to reject the charge and argued that the law, which is being passed against the most serving governor in the history of the state of Texas, is unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds from the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is located in Travis County and determined in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lemmberg refused to step back.
This veto provided a public complaint on the side of a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at the elections in Iowa during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry went on speculations that he will stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself at jogging near a lake, saying, \"South Carolina, we're coming.\"
Berkeley explains the housing market again for “normal”
One of London’s most prominent construction contractors pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England was “returning” to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were hotly coveted and object of enormous price increases, which the Bank of England, due to the widespread fear of a blaze of credit, was to set limits on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the highest level of 2013, adding that this has been a ‘stable activity environment’.
The real estate market in London was well established during the decline, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the Cather Office, prices in the urban area have increased by 18.5% in the last year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales overall.
The average sales prices at Berkeley’s private, low-priced and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year and amounted to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, in recent months, a stronger pound has made real estate property in London less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible \"village tax\" before the general elections in the coming May.
Last week, London's real estate agent Foxton warned that the mortgage market report for April, in which sharper loan arrangements were presented, in the second half of the year, would also lead to lower market growth both in real estate sales and in prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling off.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on a already weakening home price awareness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now declined by one quarter year, according to broker WA Ellis.
However, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the reasonable amounts for appointment sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, the date sales remained stable.
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the highest level in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 percent annually to £280 million, sales by 18% to £1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley is expected to meet current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to be £ 450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed in the London trade in the afternoon at £23.96.
Naked photos by Jennifer Lawrence published by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appeared at the 85th Oscar Award.
Naked photos of Oscar award winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a “master list” of images of another 100 Starlets.
A representative of the Star from Panem’s tribute confirmed that Lawrence’s photos were real and accused the hacker of “exclusive privacy violation.”
The authorities have been notified and will pursue all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were allegedly created by a gap in Apple's online storage system iCloud. The alleged \"Masterlist\" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It’s not sure how many of the images are real, even though Winstead, star from “Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world” also condemned the hack on Twitter.
“To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are so satisfied with you - Winstead wrote on Twitter.
But Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series -iCarly - and Victorious - argues that the photos are images of her and tweeted - these so-called nude images from me are pleasing, people.
Let's go back to the beginning. *Word game intended*.
Buzzfeed reported on the late Sunday that a spokesperson for the pop star Ariana Grande denied her the authenticity of the alleged photos.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel about love and the letters \"J\"
They split up, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved up like a carton that you had in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, demanding, intense, disabled, and perhaps somewhat scratchy.
And then shook his hand.
He knew Kratzbürstig.
There was a lot of stuff, like Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stabbing was a just beginning affair, which was more promising for a relief of the lonely length of his life than otherwise, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a glisteningly tender beauty with untamed hair and a floating heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion who held Kevern for her aunt, and who had inherited a property in a wet but paradise valley called Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaky, in which baths were still spiders, necks had left their tracks on all windows and believed that they heard all of this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel “J” is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding on to the broken armchairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had sounded spiritlessly to the service console, which provided the country with calm music and humbling messages when the sight of their curved brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer, whose father had liked to lag at closed wheelchairs in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their early aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was so properly forbidden - simply not played.
It was successfully obsolescised, just as the word obsolescence.
The general taste created what releases and regulations had never achieved, and how people in books choose the from counter-teller-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and love novels, so they chose the ballads at the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and singing large feet in a rough-comic serenade of Ailinn.
Aillinn didn't understand that.
“This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller,” he explained and automatically laid two fingers on his lips.
His father always did this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told me.
When you start a word with a J without placing two fingers over your lips, it costs you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game at the time, and it wasn’t very fun right now.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what Jazz was like.
Ailinn had never heard of any of them.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly forbidden.
Improvising was no longer modern.
It was just a place for a single “if” in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
And the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
Jazz was a musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father’s half secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he did not have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably could not remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or restrictions.
A conformable society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group authority - gratefully as those spared from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and body construction, so they sang and ran.
People who were originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as by nature and were tasked to ensure that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was still left of the Polish community was about channeling; what was left of the Greeks was uprooting counters.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents did not leave the country as soon as WASCHEHEN WAR, when it was good-for-all, were out of fear to be charged with fire wounds, even fear that the flames would consume them next - had opened Labneh and Shisha Pfeifen restaurants, kept in mind and became inactive.
Everyone according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just told her could ever be shown.
Music was an expression of love.
“They’re not really insulting,” Kevern said.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the sad feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge cold-like leaves.
I still don't understand Ailinn.
Why should your father love such a thing?
He wanted to say it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on the lips in their presence.
She thought he was something extraordinary.
“It seemed funny to him,” he said instead.
He was blinded and blinded.
There was nothing to see around the world other than her uncomplicated rabbit black hair.
There was nothing he wanted to see.
“When you say it, it means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're sending it to me.
They seemed honest.
Are my feet too big?
He saw it again.
Your feet are not so direct.
Maybe your garlic, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my knees are too thick?
Do you hate?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, “I love you, but it was too early for that.
“Your thick knots are just the reason you like me,” he tried.
I'm a bit perverse.
It didn't sound right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be comic, he often brought himself into trouble, because he did not have the calming charm that one needed in order to touch the gritty in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from her chair, threw the console around and poured out the wine they had drunk.
Holunderblowing wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to sit like palm weed in the storm.
“And your thick head is just the reason why I feel drawn to you perversely,” she said.
Except that I'm not.
She was sorry for him, both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago, where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke up here as it did on the shore.
The same confused men, with even denser skin and more saddened after DEM WAS GESCHEHEN WAR when it had been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, pulled from knees to knees, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown you a thick fist if you hadn't watched her!
It was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a counter-giving to the non-saying love ballads from the console, they first kissed and then hit.
According to Kevern, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the Knutsch himself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon gave him a sign to go through his body.
He raised himself out of the chair like an old man.
She also felt pale, but the weight of her grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They didn't know anything about it.
She looked at him as he was away, as a room on the upper floor saw her companion, a man, complaining about something that he himself had complained about.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, though some had raised her hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bent his back, humiliated, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was this a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time when she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn looked at Solomon’s feet.
Several years ago, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative supervisory body for the public vote, worked on a brief talk on the continued violence at low and medium-level levels in exactly the parts of the country in which, if not abolished, they would have been most expected, given the money and energy invested in the elimination of this violence.
“A lot has already been done, and much has yet to be done,” she wrote, “to bring about the innate aggressiveness of a people, which has led to a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human kindness has been historically seen in spite of the high-questioning church towers between the fences.
But some properties appear to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, the lower the passion he continues to awaken.
The people cry when listening to sentimental ballads, are appalled by stories of overcome difficulties and claim to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only does the former rawness hold the rural communities as well as our urban assets firmly in hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and persistent conflict at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
“They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate,” her mentor said when he read the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to say that,” replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Once again, Esme appealed to her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feministine?
Still silence.
“I don’t ask,” said Luther Rabinowitz, “because I was against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a prejudicial job.
We serve a prejudicial society.
But certain types of hypersensibility that are absolutely acceptable and commendable in themselves can occasionally distort results as you have presented them.
They themselves have obvious prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call “shrewd” and “shrewd,” could be interpreted by others as well as expression of a natural force and vitality.
If you continue on the road, what is good, when it is good, as if it would happen yesterday, it means taking its essential life force to the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED script in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow gave to the country in the last quarter or more.
Smile to your neighbors, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen to you, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the singing word is better than the written one, but nothing is better than love.
“I absolutely understand what you want to go beyond,” Esme Nussbaum replied with a calm voice when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, “and I say nothing but that we have not been healed as effectively as we are forming ourselves.
My concern is that without warning, we may find ourselves rediscovering ourselves, as we repeat the mistakes, which are only to the One who was good enough, when it was good enough.
This time, however, it is not the others that we leave out our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
In order to show English patience.
“They’re going too far,” he said, “if you’re referring to actions as “wrong” that our grandparents may or may not have done.
They also go too far when you say that they left their “word” and their “mistrust” to “other.”
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that when understanding the past as well as protecting the present, we are not talking about “ours” and “others”.
There was no “we” and there was no “other”
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
“Of those who, if we are honest with ourselves,” Esme dared to throw in, “can’t claim a part of society to be well behaved.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what happened has happened.
That was back then.
There is nothing more to be said about this - we agree.
And just as no debt has to be allocated, no debt must also be removed if such a relief would be appropriate and if there was a way to relieve it.
But what does the past serve if we do not learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget it.
If I can say something about it -
Luther Rabinowitz had his pyramids collapsed.
“I’ll think of her report,” he said and fired her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was crossed by a motorcycle driver who, as passengers described, was on the foot in a kind of brutal rage.
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup was planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho fought to have a coup d'état to overthrow the government and said they were facing police officers who are being accused of gunning political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country’s army had converted its residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighboring South Africa after he reported on assassination threats.
Military spokesperson Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was no state strike in de facto, but that the military responded to the threat by “political fanatics” whose armaments were being pushed by the police.
“What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho’s defense forces acted after receiving several secret service reports that within the police there were some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were shortly ahead of them,” he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesperson Clayson Monyela said the military action has caused a overthrow.
“Even if no one has claimed that the government has been torn down by violence, all reports agree that Lesotho’s defense forces’ activities have so far shown signs of a coup,” he said.
Speakers of Lesotho's military told Sunday that the soldiers were retreating into their barracks and the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, Vice Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over government leadership during Thaban's absence.
Thabane said he believed he had become a target disc because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There have been great tensions in Lesotho since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disputes in his unitary government.
He said his actions would not have unterminated the government, otherwise loud accusations to the contrary.
Production in the Eurozone on a 13-month depth
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, a closely observed study said.
The final Markit shopping manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a state of 51.8 in July.
An indication over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced breaks in a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures shall be received before the meeting of the European Central Bank (EZB) on Thursday.
The markets expect a clear plan from the bank to deal with a delaying recovery of the eurozone and a threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the Head of the Committee, Mario Draghi, could provide further information over the course of this week as to whether he is considering a quantitative relief for the eurozone, according to those who were carried out by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
“Although a small growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for manufacturers have become clearer,” said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the decline of Italy from a solid expansion to the Stagnation.
Note that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism Germany as well as Spain and the Netherlands are no longer soothing,” Mr Dobson said.
The decline in the industry is likely to spark the fire of analysts expecting further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief business expert at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing you can say for the shopping management index of the manufacturing industry in the Eurozone from August is that the sector continues to grow.”
He added: “Producers in the eurozone are currently finding life obviously quite difficult, as the current increased geopolitical tensions, especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine, increase uncertainty in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably causes some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that it is becoming more and more likely that the Committee will eventually have to introduce some kind of QE, although we suspect that this will be limited.
The decade of hell of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the fearsome siege of the school, as the children in it are still suffering.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostages by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan, South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the grueltat in the classroom.
Just a decade after the excruciating siege of the school of Beslan, where 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
As a fanatical Islamist terrorist, children and parents captured and killed on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year seemed like the worst of the evil.
The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst distress.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the grueltat in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, though the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your biggest hope?
That the war that Ukraine is now home to - and in the child like it is dying - is now an end.
The girl who was photographed in an attempt to climb back to the school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow when she only tried in her underwear to climb back to the destroyed school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Aida was completely confused looking for her mother, Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
“A woman told me I was running for my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My legs were blood-soaked.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier took her safe.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely healed, but yesterday said: “Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'll have to be operated again.
Some pomegranates are still in my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it didn’t break me,” she says.
“That’s what happened to me, and you can’t change that.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain part of her, although the memory will get a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself coming back to school online, I think many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster, and contribute to something like this not going to happen again.
The boy who fled through the bullet, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at age 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, “Mama told me that I’d lie down when there was an explosion and hold her hand.”
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, “Follow.”
Full of fear, she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying little child on the way, caught it at the hand, and fled through a bullet.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son out of the arms, said: “Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, “I couldn’t save her.”
In fact, Tamara was pushed outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, on her part, in the assumption that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said: “I weep for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and embraced me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now-resolved News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
“This horror chases you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering,” he said yesterday.
But I can say that it will be paleer in my memory.
I still know I'm going to throw away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes and that's not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid of going back to the sports hall, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember these children with whom I played in the court, and who didn't manage to go outside.
We never say they were killed or killed.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially at the toy store where I could choose everything I wanted and drive in an open car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of trouble he and his friends suffered.
This horror chases you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
“I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors,” Damir said, working as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I want to help.
I want one day to go to police and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: “37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and that silence took many months.
She vividly recalls her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I then understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and simply tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I still remember how Damir likes to eat Borschschsch and call on all local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shot at her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: “I always think this world has not become better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just such children as ours.
I think that for many of the war is a part of the news they hear when they are tired or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that’s so sad.
Damir became big and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past atrocities.
I know he doesn’t like to remember, but he has six close friends from class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he left below - I remember how he sometimes put himself on the sofa, the face turned away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I still remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys on. Damir is now 17, bigger than I, looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with all around body parts.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
“I remember that I walked away with him, “Damir, run away,” but I was also so sure he didn’t hear me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike that of many others, goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the Greuel of Beslan
The Beslan Survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 siege, right a picture of Georgij today
His blood flown face was drawn of fear when he ran around his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarians of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had suspended him for his first day of school before rushing away to bring her older son Vladimir to university.
“I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone,” she recalls.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the more difficult it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no day on which we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time since, I mean it would happen yesterday, some scenes from these days are always following me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intrusive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was preserved as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgian in San Marino.
Georgij doesn’t like the picture, and it’s hidden with us at home in the bookstore.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: “It’s important that something like this never happen again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never knowing the truth.
And now she is investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever learn what caused him?
This world becomes a terrible thing.
“I can’t understand how this is possible because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years are nothing in such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget a little.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when the 1st of September gets closer.
I want to count my old childhood friend Tribute.
It’s hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I'm not going to forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I completed school this year and attended a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I'll be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not permit it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won’t happen.
Georgij Fanijev, 20
The boy who survived, though he was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist
One miracle: Georgij Faniyev was caught during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was held at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
“We feel it as if it had been yesterday,” says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a intelligence officer, but was unable to do so due to his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I'm older now and people say that kids can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say, that's not true.
“2006 I worked with psychologists and felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - the following year - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there again and please do not ask me to show you where I have sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijev today, with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is uneasiness and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like thinking about it or talking about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically it's good for me.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can now run well.
But because of my health, I couldn’t study at the FSB’s Secret Service Academy in Saint Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns how to treat all animals - from cats to cows -
He said: “I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.
In addition, children should know nothing, and they should not, of course, suffer.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse when the anniversary draws closer.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be much more violent for him because he was there and I was not.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help him.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me, and here in Beslan all are drawn from it.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept this if something so unfair happens.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated several times, he can run, but no sport is driving.
I would say that he has overcome the horror by 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and this only strengthened my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart weeps for the dead.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want it.
I will never forget how my heart sprang into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I’m sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more are killed.
If only we could attack and throw out all these rebels - as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was thus carried safely by a special deployment command
Gerettet: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian Special Use Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelty at all.
The world held on to the breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried into the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty kept their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar back to the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous scene.
Her father, Ruslan, has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife, Swetlana, whom he named after his lost daughter, Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
“They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are for about $300.
I have taken these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all of which are available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are closed.
Set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the damp underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is capable of functioning.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our shop guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many won't hit.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams usually don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s difficult to see this under water, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So make a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a series mode that makes a series of recordings with slightly modified lighting settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will be dramatically worse the further you remove from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when making recordings in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is especially important when working with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects when they are to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As consulting anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to saving the sick both the agonie of the disease and the maladies of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to diagnoses and diseases, while the treated are mostly concerned with something very different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
“I didn’t feel that way,” he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble getting up.
While fighting with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he made impatient accusations to his wife Juliet.
“I want everything right away than later,” he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt extremely unusual and uneasy.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct an X-ray examination of his chest.
It was only two weeks ago that he skied in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray investigation was.
He suffers from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest, that is, the skin that overtakes the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers are suffering from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers before.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the triggerer is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which once was considered a ‘wonder substance’ but has now been considered deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has been no longer used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry volunteered to stop using it.
Even where he was still in use, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - clampers, construction workers, carpenters and yard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous material from a different time period, it seems to be hardly worrying today.
But this self-sufficiency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is now experiencing the climax of a mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths by Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as from traffic accidents.
Annual figures of mesotheliom deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason why we now experience the deadly effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999 all types of asbestos were banned), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And Mesotheliom's belts are not limited to former construction workers.
Asbest was, and is often still present, in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore, Mesotheliom does not know about classrooms, financial boundaries, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant shophouses in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
Parliamentary buildings are as best as best possible.
Even in the hospitals in which we are to be healed, we have already been made the starting host of this deadly cancer.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a clemency either.
In fact, he found it hard to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
“It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy’s Hospital, where I completed my training for six years,” he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and writers - use the tunnel.
How many of my old people are going to suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer at least in part.
“From the four doctors who were trained at Guy’s Hospital and who have been ill with mesothelioma in the last five years, he wrote in a letter in 2010, “I am the last one still living.”
How many of us are still getting sick?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
This was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliomer patients die within 8 months after diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatally.
So we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us are still going to get sick?”
The UK’s leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to arrive, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have fallen to the victim.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die that way.

A brief look at the acts of the courts, to which the affected often turn due to compensation requirements, shows how far the dish of the mesothelioma has already spread.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had accidentally exposed asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which is the flagship store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she began her work at M&S.
Now she has two children in her twenties.
“Before this thing,” she says, “I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn’t even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word \"Asbestiform\", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as a white asbestos, is the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It was used for rooftops, floor plates, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake coatings in cars.
It is less deadly than other asbestos forms, but is still considered by the EU and WHO to be a “great risk of health” with possible death.
But more dangerous is the brown asbestos (Amosite) and the blue asbestos (Crokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that \"there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesotheliom rates.\"
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy at the flagship store in Oxford Street, London.
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is not uncommon at all.
He has presented a study of those affected, showing that “a substantial proportion of mesotheliomes without known suspension by work or at home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment.”
Much of these contacts are based on the “normal use and ageing” of our buildings.
It looks like no one can be sure.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been exposed to the substance in the heart of the government as well.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind the committee rooms of Parliament had been suffocated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be uprooted by something as harmless as “strong air movements.”
Members of parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it looks like meeting the opposite.
While the direction of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace has received a 'clean health aid', it is now undisputed that £1 billion has to be spent over several years in order to renew the Parliament, modernize the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, MPs will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that “the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the respective provisions”
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who could never exactly determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to the asbestos during his work in hospitals.
“I’ve worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints have been decided positively,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It’s so difficult to remember all the places you’ve worked on and the data.
What he remembers is the day in early December 2009 when he got such a fever.
He was 45, and had an operation just late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had gunpowder.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I was going to make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the chest skin caused skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He did not go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors made X-ray recordings of his chest and set Pleurakathether to remove fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his job.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sports activity and intense breathing.
In 2011, a patient had Abbotts with similar symptoms in his or her practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbot does not do this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray recordings to an expert group.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott first felt sick, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the chest.
I am an optimist.
I usually just go on,” he says.
Honestly, I didn't have so many concerns at all.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was the week between Christmas and New Year: “I was told that it was Mesotheliom.”
Graham Abbott: Diagnose Mesotheliom
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan patients, one of whom he recommended to take an attorney.
It is only now that he understands the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos,” he said.
The people who were exposed to the asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes in hospitals were below the earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who had moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (such as Graham Abbott often did) came in contact with the toxic substances.
It appears that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's going to be removed today too.
Students put off their bunsenburners on asbestos mats.
And it doesn't just concern hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of its fabled insulating and flammable properties.
I don't know.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of hours of chemical, students have put their bunsenburners on asbestos mats.
On websites, the topic of asbestos in schools is now often addressed.
And at the same time, as innocent objects in our homes, such as floor plates or shed roofs, have by default contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial gift that’s included in much of our real estate,” notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that touched a woman affected was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So take care of how to tear down your garden sheds.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is inescapable, are immense.
“It takes a while to process that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I noticed that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
With the biggest difficulty, the perspective change was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
“It was very difficult to record everything,” he said.
\"I asked my doctor how long I've been
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I’m not going to have another Christmas party.
That was it, then.
Mesothelioma is particularly secretive because it is our life-sustaining mechanism - breathing itself - that causes deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is turned up and the fibers are inhaled, they can be trapped in the chest skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breast skin and can trigger cell mutations.
“The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers,” said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who changed to Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
The hospital, which Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to the asbestos, is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to the asbestos during their training at the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, “they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From the very beginning, it has been invasive from the very beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work as well in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation is, for example, hotly disputed.
Some think she's worth an attempt.
Treasure makes this happen.
“You can’t cut the chest,” he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
At the same time, the cancer does not speak very well on chemotherapy, but does not heal the effect.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a one-man support and consulting office for fellow patients.
“Hello, cancer center,” he cheerfully presented himself on calls.
“He was very positive,” Abbott said.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would last four months and would probably extend his life by only one month.
“I was desperate,” he said.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to let things appear in a slightly more positive light.
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
“We had an advantage in not having to be referred to, I just called and got an appointment,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the approval of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to observe the best available therapies.
But when these treatments finally fail irrefutablely, many affected ones face another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in hopes of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health,” Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that a very small burden was also a health risk.
And here, the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually added their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a \"full compensation\" since Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact with Guy's.
After the investigation into his death, however, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that \"the asbestos fibers were removed in the affected basement area in the 1990s.\"
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is for mesothelioma patients who strive for compensation, an enormous problem to assign the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who resist claims know that time is for them, but certainly not with the accusers.
In response, this year there were significant new legislation that makes it easier for mesotheliom concerned to complain about compensation, even if their former employers are no longer on notice.
The law has set up a £ 350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for all those diagnosed after July 2012, but no one can complain.
In these cases, the prosecutors receive 80 percent of what a court could have said to them in a normal compensation process - about £120,000.
About 300 successful applications for the programme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioms that £350 million was a “very good job” of the insurance industry.
“This is a deal of insurers for insurers,” he says, pointing out that this sum is a quarter of what applicants should have paid if time hadn’t gone over it and mesotheliom disease could find the companies and bring them to normal charges.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pension, also admitted that the law was “not perfect.”
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven deaths, a quick action was needed every day.
“People suffer so much and need help today,” said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act in December of last year.
At the time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their initial advice, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that allows Lang-Lazdunski to present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
“This, of course, is with the most important thing,” Abbott says.
This is always seen in patients.
There is something that will keep you going.
If you give up, it's going to get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Aftercare scans did not show any signs of the disease.
Then in March 2014, I had a scan.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is life-ending.
Abbott again underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very hard.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease that I would not age with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very friendly and ungrateful.
She told her friends and we soon received a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reluctant.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients need to do.
But for mesotheliomer patients, such conversations have not been conducted by hope, not by a trace of hope of survival.
The disease (as well as finally for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a gruesome security.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China rejects Hong Kong's right to government election, protesters swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased call for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections, the Chinese Parliament decided by the Hong Kong voters.
This action probably fueled the long-recognized protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists led planning and mobilisation to this within a few hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People’s Congress allows communist leaders to reject all non-peking-faith candidates.
“That’s not unexpected, but it makes us angry,” said Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
The residents of Hong Kong have been logged in.
And it is clear that we have to deal with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations in the Hong Kong government elections would be \"chaotic\".
Since 1997, when the UK returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to allow residents to elect the government’s seat as of 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision from Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct right to vote for the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is holding the course firmly in hand by a Beijing-controlled nominee committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates, with love for the country and love for Hong Kong, are to be allowed.
The decision follows a summer in which some of Hong Kong’s largest and most public-friendly protests took place for several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shoot down the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real general election.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters within a few hours after the announcement.
In the demonstration, the organizers said their movement has reached a new level of civil disobedience and planted protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not make any further information on this, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement “has considered the occupation of the Central District only as the last means, an action to take place only when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all the dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement for days, and on Sunday, security measures, including police forces and barricades, had been lifted.
The unrest is reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The addition of people from the mainland enhances competition for products and services.
In addition, fear is growing that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, begin to break down under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central Movement, as they threatened the business - the leader of Hong Kong.
“The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved in it and how long it lasts,” said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to be afraid that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled media of China also recently reported on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights of 780,000 people - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the United States is now transferred to the universities where freshmen performances are offered with the private aircraft.
We are happy to be able to respond to this demand and offer the UK’s first luxury travel service for students today.
To achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security spare.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to kiss their belongings in a dangerously overcharged car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury this year.
One company spokesperson said that no new bookings have yet been made, since the service had just been introduced, but added that “students would book the service in the next few weeks.”
The company also stated that despite the study fees of £9,000 per year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and claims from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as being suspended.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education, said: “This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month are facing a crisis of living costs, as available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships does not take steps with the strongly rising bills for the simplest living grounds before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at the student's home.
Feminists criticize racial issues and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. early this month.
The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang, “Hands high, don’t shoot,” while waiting before the funeral.
After two-week protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminist commentators put gender in front of the race when it comes to addressing reproductive law and income inequality.
However, while the tensions in the Middle West increased and attention was received throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers from white women turned 100% around the race.
In comparison with the answers of black women shortly after the shootings of August 9, the personal essays with titles such as — thoughts about Ferguson from a white woman — and Feminism are not just about the oppression of women — were relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
“I don’t think that in feminism you find many people who are talking about white and privilege in such a high-class way,” she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnoised that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson revealed problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but are not regarded as “women’s themes” in cultural space.
“I can post something fun on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colorful people in their own country are under siege, silence is ear-stirring.
“How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space,” she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to clean up the themes; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now link the issues of race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lied to and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman,” Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white fighters for women's electoral rights such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for electoral rights could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
“They made the decision to appeal to women’s electoral law, and the right to vote for black should come later,” Hattery said.
When you remember such things, one will realize with power why colourful women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were granted the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to be organized against the Lynch in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group arose nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists \"fangs\" played with the problems that black women have faced for generations.
“It wouldn’t be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do so with the right to receive control,” Mitchell asked.
The women of the second generation, who build their career on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to preventative means, are now trying to understand what this means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown's shooting and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on racism.
“I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger inherent in the body — and opinions on race that are clearly different in public polls — will lead to changes,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a more abstract feminism in which racial and gender themes are addressed, some of her comments on racial issues in America are still elusive.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of Who Stole Feminism, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are far more vulnerable than their sisters, but Steinem’s remarks to Ferguson are contrary to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently imposed a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that forces itself in the front of mainstream feminism.
After nearly 63,000 unaffiliated minors arrived at the country’s Southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform is again on the surface - this time as a women’s theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-examination of the subject as an essential women’s theme, she only had to publish the stories of immigrants.
“They speak for themselves,” Mercado said.
When the large majority of working visas go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories find a backyard in the women’s organizations,” she said.
\"Sweine-Haus\" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed from real estate brokers when it became clear that it showed a large pig that made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig that had his head bent on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig on the photo was the owner's pet.
“The photo, however, was erroneously published and has now been removed,” said one of the company’s spokespersons.
In the Exposé of the House, Connells described the former House of Assembly as a \"unusual single-family house with a bedroom\"
Although the broker removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of homes in the social media was of interest when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW City of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after Lotto win.
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month.
The search for a new millionaire in southwestern Perth takes on, with a happy winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from the lottery training on Saturday.
A newspaper skiosk in Harvey moved the jackpot for the second time in five years in the draw of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
The happy winner, however, has to report.
The store owner, Steve Forward, said the profit was taking care of conversation material in the small town in southwestern Perth.
The city speaks of nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a win could happen.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a fine finish for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had achieved a $7.5 million mega win just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said the win allowed them the possibility of a world trip and buying a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas in the Gladiatorsa
Not only the gladiators were in the Matsch at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the leisure park.
However, the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who despite the rains and the autumn colds and were left restless by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful series of performances, performances, games, exhibition pieces and information about the time of the Romans and their importance to the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter forces of Gladiatorial School - Amor Mortis - who used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial arts with soft sand.
Gladiators’ owner, Leonidas, proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and sent his men in the ring to the heroic two-way fight in various gladiatorial genres.
First, the “provocators” were on the line with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It was followed by the \"Essedarii\" with breast shield, short sword and worm plant, as well as a large gladiatorial helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the Retiarius, which with throwing net, tributary, and dolch against the \"Secutor\", and after a short fight, the Burses fell to the ground.
As the swords were metallical to each other, the shields created and the worms flew surreptitiously through the arena that a fear and bange could become the health of gladiators.
But the imposing “Summa Rudis” of the musculoskeletal judge, had an ever-obsessed eye.
“We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era live,” said Lorenzo Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer’s “Friend’s Circle of the Roman Canal, the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, a \"Oppidum Romanum\" from the leisure park became a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage stated in his greeting.
Finally, the Romans not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of these were also to be admired during the Roman Day, such as 'Aqueduct-Marmor' from the 11-metre-high and 1,400-foot-long Roman Canal Bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once presented the water and energy supply and now, and managing director Petra Fricke knew: “We are still benefiting from the knowledge of then-
This also confirmed diploma measurement engineer Ralph Heiliger from Rheinbach, who presented the measurement instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as brick stones from the original hypocauste, the warm air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
It was also impressive to see the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two thousand years ago in the footsteps of sound before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office of Land Monument Care at the Landesverband Rhineland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the commercial park Nord in Rheinbach.
It has been found to cover walls of an economic building with a darre for drying grain and mulch.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a decorative necklace.
The villa may have existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suggests.
In addition, the children engaged in the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or, like once, the Roman students wrote their names with metal grips on wax tables.
At the status of the Roman thermal zülpich, the children of mosaics were allowed to lay themselves, at the status of the Rheinbach Glass Museum, and at the state of the Eifel Nettersheim Natural Center, to serve a heavy wheat mill made of stone to mill the flour for a bottle bread or a mäsli.
With the original Roman travel cars built up by two cold flowers, visitors passed through the leisure park and also passed the impressive state of the urban high school, which presented the results of their “Roman project weeks” here.
With a week of Rome from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also be brought into the Rhineland-wide Roman year 2014 to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2,000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, there are also offered thematic walks, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes and recalling the Roman past Wachtbergs.
For example, a Roman legionary is told of his work on the nearby Wachtberg, presented plants as living monuments from the Roman period, and offered a witty lesson in terms of people's understanding between a group of Wachtbergers - Germans - and attracted Romans.
The Adendorfer Grundschule is dedicated to the Roman theme in a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, often but no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be rediscovered.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus a small presentation will be reminded of the find of the Berkumer Matron sanctuary in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic burdens West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a severe blow to the economy.
Markets are ruined - and international companies go at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic puts a heavy strain on West Africa's economy.
The crop is rotting on the fields that are mined and the markets are ruined - the virus has made the region difficult.
Some international companies are already at a distance.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one,” says the chief of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest affected
“It’s a total disaster, we lose a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothing on the second largest market in Liberia’s capital Monrovia.
On the market, only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola come to the market.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, only here more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, the health authorities declared that the disease was prevalent at every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
A total of more than 1500 people were killed, thousands more were killed.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries, companies shut down their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, several international airlines no longer fly the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers also respond: few merchants are still leaving their homes to worry about the afterlife.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantines, the cocoa and coffee beans in the fields, among other things, were destroyed.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food will be scarce
“People are going to travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert for West Africa’s economy.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables is more likely to stay home.
The population is therefore given the consequences of the epidemic directly and forced to feel: food is becoming scarce.
In the markets, the supply of basic foods, such as rice, disappears.
At the same time, the strongly dependent region of international companies threatens an image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies will basically avoid the area over a long period of time, says Philippe Hugo of French Think Tank Iris.
How far and how long the virus will spread.
In the case of investors, the impression may arise that \"it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest\" warns Hugo.
The disease also burdens the state budgets of the states
The disease also burdens the already-stricken state budgets of the countries concerned.
The ECB's rating agency fears that their budgets will be strongly affected by the high spending on the health system and in addition by the worsening economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to assist the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (45 million).
The effects are also detectable in Nigeria, where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already living at home out of fear of an infection.
Reservations in hotels are also significantly reduced.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein - Tannenwald - Berngau celebrates its 50-year founding festival from 12 to 14 September.
At the Schützenverein Tannenwald, the preparations for the 50-year founding festival run from 12 to 14 September.
Planned on Friday, September 12, a great evening of entertainment with the group \"Dorfrocker\"
On Saturday, at 18 a.m., is the big bowler shooter.
Then, in the big feast of the evening of the mood with the \"Stoapällzer Spitzbuam\"
Blaskapelle provides music
On Sundays the feast service and 9.30 p.m. in the parish church and the big fortress are around 14 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the Federal and Gaussitung.
A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 Festdams with their Dirndln.
The festival chapel is the blaskapelle Berngau.
The screen control has been taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original term “Schutzengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau” dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for “social entertainment by means of exercise in the room- and small-caliber shooting”.
The NS regime had initiated the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who on 30 April, in the guesthouse of Lukas, lifted the \"new - Schützenverein - Tannenwald - Berngau from the baptism.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as guardians through a difficult start-up period, in which it was primarily about finding a club location and installing the shooting operation.
As early as the fall of 1965, the Schützenverein started in the guesthouse “Leininger” with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sport protections, which were now organized into seven teams, were established in all classes up to 1st Gauliga.
The association records were purple every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached by Rudi Meier for the first time in 1980.
As the performance of the active shooters has increased, member numbers have also developed positively.
After the association’s “Leininger” was no longer satisfied with the demands of a modern Protector Association, the board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domizil in the basement rooms of the new “Landgasthof Härteis”.
After a work performance of 2,700 hours on May 8, 1988, parish priest Strasser gave the church-level blessing for the new shelters.
One of the major highlights in the association history was certainly the 44th Gaussie, associated with the solemn pasture of the new gunfire in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary of founding.
In 1995, a group of parents was established.
Josef Schmalzl became the BöllerReferencerent.
A major challenge for the \"Böllers\" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böller Meeting in 2005.
In many hours of honorary work, the association members have modernized the rooms and shooting facilities in Berngauer Hof last year and have thus brought them to the latest level of technology.
Eleven teams in round competitions
See also the sporting performance of the Protector Association.
A total of eleven teams currently participate in the round competitions: six Air Force teams, an air gun team, a sports gun KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose to the District League 1 in the round 2013/14 by Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB).
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schühmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting sport, events such as Bockstechen, Fasching and King’s Ball, Association Excursion and Christmas have tradition.
With this, the guards are also at the feasts in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers from an accident when he returns to the racetrack
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart ran against the wall for the second time after his right front tyres placed in round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed, but now focus on racing next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
“I wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him,” Johnston said.
We drive to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart used to run at the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch in a wall and had to repair the right side of his car.
“I’ve come in today with quite good hopes for a good result,” Johnston said, adding: “It just didn’t work.”
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the trapper and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ash train race in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or in the next race in Richmond to win a place in the pursuit.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had entered the highway during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities told Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart has to face a charge.
The three-time champion was received with great luck when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart was in the first 10 pre-seasons shortly after and was placed in fourth place in time.
After a restart in Round 122, Geriet Buschs
Caring with No. 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, both of which drove against the wall.
Stewart went on, but fell back to 21st place.
Dance-happy Young People Seek
Simply try out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Director Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to the contestants.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups on TV Jahn also make the whole day’s lessons available at the further schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have strongly decimated themselves.
Now, grown-ups are being sought for a sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation “Spirits” are only nine children.
“Three in the group of eight- to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve- to 15-year-olds, tells the 20-year-olds.
With more activities, the whole thing would make it much more fun, “you could dance quite another choreography,” she says.
Those who have a passion for dancing can go into the training hours in the dance room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, between 17 p.m. and 18 p.m. or on Fridays between 17 p.m. and 18.30 p.m.
“The training starts regularly with a warming program,” the trainer tells us.
After that, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore over classical to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, the community is not too short.
“We’re going to eat, watch dance films, and we’ve been in the dance room for a while,” says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can close friendships, share a beautiful hobby and still do a lot for your own motor development.
Whose jazz dance is not that way, he can also snuff in one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always get into the lessons in children's dance/jazztance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adults are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Anyone who has an interest in Discofox, Slow Roller, Viennese Roller, Rumba, Cha-Cha and Tango can watch and participate.
Bulgarian prison officials protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison employees from all over Bulgaria have organized a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which had recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a demand list to be discussed with interim justice minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been symbolically protesting the new working hours for a month and are demanding a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.

Ukrainian Army has abandoned Luhansk Airport
In the Ostükraine, the pro-Russian fighters continue on the advance.
After heavy fighting in which Russian tank battalions were also involved, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, has abandoned the airport of the Rebelenhochburg Luhansk.
At the same time, the army announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from his army's heavy defeats in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top military leadership, without mention of details.
Prorussian separatists shoot off plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists once again shot down a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in battles in the Donezk region, according to Russian agencies on Monday.
Ships of Coast Guard Return
The insurgents also claimed that for the first time in the Asovian Sea two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard had been lowered.
Ukrainian border protection confirmed that two of his ships were under attack on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesperson in Kiev told the station 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that several localities in the Donezk area had brought under their control.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
Today, in the Belarusian capital of Minsk, the Ukraine-based group is meeting.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, there should also be a representative of the separatists from the Ostükraine.
In advance, all players used their appearances to publicize their claim.
NATO doesn’t want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to planned stations in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adhered to the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
However, the NATO chief accused Russia of \"a cracking break\" of the agreement.
“Today we need to see reality in the eyes that Russia does not view NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
The Russian side’s documents and opinions are based on “that they consider us to be enemies”
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A \"Readines Action Plan\" to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that \"we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as necessary,\" Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed on official information on new talks to resolve their gas disputes.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday, Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
A European Union decision will be waited for whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the price of gas, Ukraine has not received fuel from Russia for weeks.
Finally, EU energy commissioner Günther Oettinger had sent between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the supply of gas for Europe.
Europe refers to about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, most of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel says Powerword: Tout will come \"very clear\"
Now, the chancellor will admit to this once again.
A free letter for all complicated details, however, is not.
Hard-hearted concerns from the CDU against the car tout have gripped the CSU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has, after continuing resistance from her CDU, spoken a power word for the introduction of a car toll.
“To make it clear, she is in the coalition contract, and she will come,” said the party chief of the CDU Spitzengremien in Berlin on Monday.
Merkel, however, did not establish himself on a detailed model at first.
The black-red government program is called \"determined parameters\".
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal, and it is now being further worked on.
However, the NRW CDU insists on its no toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that financial minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also brings constructively into the advice for a bill.
In addition to the topic, he also spoke with Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, for example in broadband expansion.
\"There's nothing special about it - Schäuble had left a 'spiegel' report uncommunicated on Sunday, his house tested its own concept to compensate highway investors with toll revenue - after the 2017 election.
CSU Chief Horst Seehofer warned against developing tout concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU contact vice Armin Laschet answered his objections.
“The coalition agreement never went out of control of all the county and federal roads,” said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU Country Chairman.
In that case, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to speak again about the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU countries associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
Backgrounds are fears that a tout will affect the small border traffic to neighboring states.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty because of the tout criticism from rows of CDU.
The Left views the plans as failure on the basis of the dispute in the Union.
“The Murks-Maut is dead,” said party chief Bernd Riexinger of the ‘New Osnabrücker Zeitung’ (Monday).
“With the Maut failure of the Minister, Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette duty on all German roads that are scheduled to start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be charged in addition in accordance with the coalition contract.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the tout via the vehicle control.
However, the model may not be detrimental to foreign drivers under EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
A British woman said she thought she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few more years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffers from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK said misdiagnosis are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an uncertain walk and curved toes.
The disease is inescapable and progressive, which means the symptoms are getting worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from peace-rich ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she was 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same thing as the others did.
I fell down constantly and everything took longer for me.
I could never ride with the other kids wheelchair or skateboard and was often handcuffed in school because of my way of going and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve her Achillesesnes and stretch her feet, she saw her sick acts when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I told no one, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society,” she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and terrified in panic.
I thought I would be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25, and in between would lose all my skills.
I did all of this alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said when she became 17, she became aware that her abilities had not declined as strongly as she had imagined and questioned her doctor.
He just stood up and embraced me and said, “My love, I don’t think you have that, otherwise you’re already in the wheelchair.”
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, her CMT was diagnosed.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner,” she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to pay attention to this illness.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Dieter has been working as a fireworker since the closure of the former military training site.
For almost ten years, no more shots have been done at the former military exercise site in Munsingen.
Yet, every month, death-dealing ammunition appears in the heart of the Biosphere region of Schwäbische Alb.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown on site.
An ear-puttering cracks in the explosives over the heart of the biospheric region.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot occurred at the Munich Armed Forces Force Station, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6,500-hectare area has been the core piece of the Schwäbische Alb Biosphere area, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated roads.
Tax burden on business people in Washington area increases with economic recovery
Recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax decisions for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, a newly published study last week, and companies in Washington were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia area together paid $27.6 billion to state and local agencies in 2013, an increase by 3.8 percent compared to the 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
The company’s state and local tax burden increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent in the previous year, and it was the third year of growth following the several years of declining notice 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the Services Agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue is from companies.
Virginia receives the lowest tax revenue from companies by 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is based on the company’s recovery of real estate values, the researchers say, which led to a 3.7 percent increase in real estate taxes this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1%.
While much of these profits came from major states such as California, New York and Texas, the decline appears to be also true for Washington.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase in 4.2% over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing state and local tax revenues, since the real estate taxes here are just over a fifth of the tax decisions of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
“In Maryland, much of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to offer the same services that other states offer.
The latest recovery in tax revenue by companies cannot be calculated only for the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenue also seems to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported on income taxes at state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, local tax burdens for companies do not rise uniformly in all three locations.
The increase rate in the district was 4.3% to the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an average tax income of 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes in all three offices (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high 9,975 percent.
A comparable study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that Virginia requires lower state and local corporate taxes and overall a better tax climate than in Maryland.
In the study, the district was not examined.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same set as Virginia, and the set will fall to 5 percent in the coming year.
If the state continues to achieve its income goals in the coming year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate by 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, it seems to be better for small businesses in Washington, and therefore they pay more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transition structure after which most small businesses are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia rose by 20% last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than the total corporate taxes.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country will probably continue this year, with an increase in general multi-weapons tax revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, the Washington area might be able to recall if the Federal Government’s expenditure reduction affects the labour market in the region.
Partner City: German Beer for Guangzhou
Hoping and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - is the urgent desire of officials in China.
“We would be very pleased if a German brewery were to settle in our city,” said the Vice Party Secretary of the South China Metropolitan, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting an SPD delegation in his city.
Over and over again, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China came back on this issue of the twelve million-metropoles.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China.
Therefore, people also possess the power to buy German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he will be listening to a potential partner for the project in Germany.
“For beer, it doesn’t need much: good water, grain and pleasure of life,” he added at lunch with the party chief in Guangzhou.
This joy of life has already beamed out to Mr. Li, he smiled at the host.
Afterwards, the official from Guangzhou started with sheep's guff - but with red wine, which was served for the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brew art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity bid.
More business traffic
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice Party Chief Li.
The Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but in 2012, for economic reasons, the flight was cancelled.
“It would be worth it again,” the local politician was convinced.
“The trade between our two cities continues to grow.
At present, travelers had to take the route over Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire into the fore in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
\"This is a very good idea - answered Schäfer-Gümbel - the Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, nickedly agreed.
Managed Partnership
The vice-party chief of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year at a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He only came to office this year after his predecessor was transported out of office for corruption charges.
The local party chief, Wan Qinglian, also had to go.
The action against the Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is carried out with hardness by Chief Xi Jinping.
The new top politician, Li Yiwei, had worked for an American company before his party career, which is extremely unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before his arrival in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the VW car builder built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9,000-mile-long [9,000 km] Guangzhou is one of those that are maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolitan at the Perl River is almost as strong as all Hesse with its economic power.
The next year, they want to reach a gross domestic product of €250 billion, Li reported.
Joan Rivers' family - press the thumbs -
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since her entry to a hospital in New York City; however, her daughter has shown herself hopeful today that the 81-year-old comedian recovers from her illness.
“Thank you for your ongoing love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We all push the thumbs.
Her mother was sent to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday following an emergency in a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under careful observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as “serious.”
The reactions came from many sites, also in the form of an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners, which come to trade today, stricter environmental standards will apply in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1 where the buyer can detect central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars, more sharper stick oxide values apply in the pollutant class — Euro 6 .
In addition, there is more money for the equipment builders: they receive a federal minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information on Monday morning had reported: the online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - bought the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a Twitch acquisition, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked as if the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service for a cool source code was decided, and the collaboration also appeared naturally.
Twitch, which was founded three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their Bravours in games, a “YouTube for live games” such an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And “let’s play” is a video genre in which better-wiser gives the (most older) games a touch of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken up somewhat slowly, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not come about, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shah, President of Twitch: “We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster.”
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer sports rather than watching it, it is difficult to understand the attraction that comes from watching others while playing instead of even taking control console into account.
It’s one thing to look at a friend at 3:00 a.m. over the shoulder, while she slams through Resident Evil, and something else to look at a spider as he is shot in the head 20 times.
All of these games could be viewed right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so viewing without your own control over the perspective can be a good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the rapid passes in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronics age complete all the games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as not a game or humor virtuosis is involved, its twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics know like me?
Twitch is called up by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch being integrated as elegantly into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have easily sluggished.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to have: thousands of young men who will be around as advertisers.
As Twitch’s chairman, Sher, said, Amazon and Twitch “believe both in the future of gaming, and the medium does not show signs of shrinkage, not even - sluck - as a spectator sport.
At the Hüpfburg in Burggartenfest there was a lot going on the sun night.
The concept of organizers was true.
Despite the heavy rains on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At the time, the inlet had to be stopped.
“That was annoying,” said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sahraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedel Burggarten is intended to reflect brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone anyway.
This was shown early in the evening when the first visitors to the Open Air opened up.
A festival for all generations had promised the organizers.
And they succeeded.
Around the facilities on the Burggartenwiese there were salt welders, but also guests from the closer and further surroundings were comfortable.
They pursued the first live performances, whipped with the foot in the clock, enjoyed cool drinks - short: relaxation pure and enjoyment were said to be.
And that's across the generations.
While the one on deck on the extra-carried white sand at the beach bar limped with others at a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the growing up on the Hüpfburg, which was a major attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in the case of child smoldering, the willing helpers in the truest sense of the word had to do all their hands to become Lord to the urge and to enchant fantastic creations into the little faces.
The larger ones used the kicker table or participated in a skateboard workshop that directed the Goodfoot crew from salt weed.
Until the Great Rain came.
Just before 5:30 p.m., he boasted of the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
But the attractiveness of the feast did not break it.
“There were more people than expected,” said Ron Sem, who spoke of a “profession on the whole line.”
That’s why a repeat of the big party won’t stand for anything in the coming year.
Although the content and size of the event still had to be worked, Sem made it clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday to the popular vote.
He expressed anger that the inlet had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too few forces.
The result: Some who had already paid no longer came to the site.
The resonance has been very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who were slumming in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Hip-Hop band blocks`n`Rox broke off their appearance therefore deplorable.
The technicians were not able to create a half-way reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to salt Wed due to a tire pan.
“The next year they’ll be there,” the organizer said.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful by visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will be abandoned for the first time, but have to be eliminated in the second edition.
In the social network Facebook, organisers must also be critical.
“Sorry, but for 12 euros you just expected more,” Melanie Meier said on the event side.
“You’ve taken a bit of care,” Ele Zimmermann says.
Others don’t see the initial problems very closely.
I think it’s very good that some not only chatting stupidly, but also really trying to put something on their legs.
“Hut off,” writes Stephanie Jenß to Amula.
Now, the organizers will stay for a year to take these criticism points off.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
According to expectation, that is not the case.
Rather, the ready-to-read component is waiting to be inserted into the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: nearly 50 years after the space observation radar TIRA is constructed, the sleeve, called radom, will be completely renewed.
The new radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
However, the size remains a world record.
The last step towards completing the new sleeve is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old sleeve is separated and taken off with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new hole is set up.
If the weather is playing, the action should go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Attendance in the Ice Bucket Challenges Enhances Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from the UK cried so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket challenge was painful.
A woman was hospitalized after she cried so much during the Ice Bucket challenge that she reached out to the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain was so horrified when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured her facial structure.
“The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I was doing it, my jaw remained simple,” she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-olds.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that wasn't true, the jaw was tied, and then I understood that something wasn't right.
My mother and my sister saw this too and almost got into the pants before laughing, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was hospitalized to get the jaw back to the hospital after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times to Facebook and Twitter.
Will the burgers soon return to a strand?
At last, there was always a doubt between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen.
Now the board thinks about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshaus Castle, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshaus Burgfreunde, launched the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago there was no good climate between the burgverein and the burgfreund Wolfratshausen.
The views of the Wolfratshauser Burg and possible reconstruction seem to vary.
Now the two camps move together: there will soon be talks about a common process.
This confirms the board of directors Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
“I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could put ourselves together once,” Sjöberg reports.
In his view, all members of both associations could return to a strand in the future.
So be quick to record visible successes.
While the burg friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had a reconstruction of the castle at the Bergwald in the eye, for the burgverein around Sjöberg, the site is at the front of the site’s “encouragement and experience”.
Herbert Piffl, the second president of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased with the call according to his own information.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been standing before the mayors.
A new chairman is to be found in a meeting of members in mid-September.
At the moment, the club counts about 40 members, according to the 74-year-old.
“After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the association activities rest out of respect — this ‘minding phase’ was necessary to consider how it might continue —
According to Piffl, the new president will then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the burg friends could also become a current mood picture within their group.
A candidate for the presidency is not currently available, says Piffl.
\"But I am confident that someone will find himself - He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new president should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to work on the project \"but very much like to continue to work -
The different points of view regarding reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He esteems Dimbath as a “missionary” who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a closed air.
Through a high share of the population and by voluntary helpers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: “I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it is useful to drive forward the project - it can be created a “one-setting feature” for the river town.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financial through EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, believe Piffl.
“The idea of rebuilding I personally don’t want to simply throw overboard,” he hopes, “that the Burgverein may be moving something at this point.
Their goal to document history first is important and good.
Then you could look forward.
Clever ways to save on Uni textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks is more than $1,000 per year for many students, almost two semester student Matt Schroeder considered himself a clever sparidee.
He invented a loan system for books by students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the sale back.
“My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks,” said Schroeder, 19, who attended Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester had cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college board told students, on average, spend over $1,200 annually on textbooks and study materials, but there were various cost-damaging options for the students.
Online learning and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, who operates more than 250 university bookstores, said that renting text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of books were rented in the college bookstores last spring semester, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the one time for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost only one-third of the price online for which they are available in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of ‘Calculus’ by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be counted at the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Used buy
If one does not make the notes of other or normal means of use, used books are a good option.
“Calculus” is used on Chegg.com to have $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he has released 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business
The book was sold new for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended that students ask their professors if previous expenses are allowed.
Sometimes the updates for seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to used books.
Renting
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them so well, remember to give them back and you don’t want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent “Calculus” for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Please inform yourself of the provisions of the business you are renting, including the penalty fees that may apply to writing notes, submissions or signs of use.
Renters: If you don’t return the book, the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de factoly rented by providing an electronic license for a particular period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent “Calculus” for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literacy courses often find the best deals, as many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
I definitely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will first attend the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for price determination in books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order you should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually stocky.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why “Guardians of the Galaxy” Did Not Become a Cash Slaughter
\"The Expendables 3 - by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the United States, while \"Sin City: A Lady to Kill For - only $12 million of its budget of $70 million.
The film “Sex Tape” which was tailored to Cameron Diaz, played only $14.6 million at the opening weekend, while children’s films such as “Drachenzähmen easily made 2” also disappoint with revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in children’s films the lack of quality could be the reason for the films themselves.
Collin described 2014 as \"the worst year - so far for children's films and described \"drachants easily made 2 - as pure \"functional\" fantasy continuation.
In films for a slightly older target group, however, it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compares the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer film launch, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and at least 2000 canvass in the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of cinematographers and film critics and suggest that this year’s film hits are equivalent to last year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing vision habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s soon-to-be jungle book film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think the times are changing.”
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently achieved sales with the streaming costs of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on filming comics and prophesying a “core melt” Hollywood.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy can indeed contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash hitters to be expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply “cyclical” and said to Hollywood reporters: “The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema case at all, and no one will worry about the business anymore.”
When a few years ago the 2nd table tennis district class was stripped for the purpose of punishing the league division, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the Deutsche Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the program.
The result: Those who have not risen have gone down.
Göttingen's highest-class team Torpedo in the Oberliga relegation avoided the decline, but only played fifth-class in the coming season.
Four-class torpedo women remain, despite their grandiose march to the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserves enter the new association league, where the Landesliga are no longer represented by Göttinger Klubs.
For the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the association league, the Torpedo second in the national league.
What looks like a better district class is now the new district soberliga South.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Upper SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC are here.
In the district league, as regional representatives Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, the Upper SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The women's district soberliga begins at least in solstice.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
In the district league, Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen run.
With nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also, the district league staff of the SCW boys - there still torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Upper SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly founded Regional Association, the two Göttinger Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the West Staff are the Red-White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfeld SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East-Staffel play, among others, Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode district, where there are no women’s teams at all.
It is remarkable that none of the six 2nd Circuit classes achieves sound strength, here the innovative and resilient circuit board will have to think about once.
Nato summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On weekends there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall in order to hold a so-called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been pursuing the developments on weekends and talking to demonstrators who have traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flying out of the Blue Mountains
Two young bush hikers were safe with the rope winds after being caught overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up in Govetts Leap in Blackheath for her tour shortly after Sunday afternoon.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 20 a.m. when the two did not return home.
A search force from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found near Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 23 a.m.
The girl had been injured at the knee and the man had crashed and had hit his head.
Rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were supplied in stable condition with a medical car to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Government enemy protests in Pakistan escalating
The approximately 1,000 protesters were forced from the PTV building by soldiers, information minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
After a good half an hour, the transmitter resumed the broadcast.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editorial.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The protesters call for the resignation of the chief of government, to which they object to electoral fraud.
Police told me that about a mile from the Prime Minister's residence, Nawaz Sharif, there had been clashes between some 3,000 protesters and security forces on Monday.
According to hospital details, a police officer was injured.
At least three people were killed on the weekend and more than 500 were injured when protesters tried to advance to Sharif's residence.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict on Sunday evening after a meeting in the Army headquarters, \"without wasting time and using it without violence.\"
The report added: “The army remains committed to ensuring the safety of the state.
The escalating violence has caused concern for the military’s intervention, which has been more frequent in the past.
The protests launched by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have been ongoing since the day of independence on August 14.
Sharif rejects a resignation.
Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters on Sunday to run out.
“We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign,” Khan said.
Qadri expressed himself similarly.
Khan accuses Sharif of having won the parliamentary election last May by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are in use to protect the government district.
The protesters had first been peaceful before Parliament until Khan and Qadri invited them to come to Sharif's residence on the weekend.
Hütldorfer, after the second season, finished third in the table.
With the 2:0 above Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday for Rapid has taken a reasonable end.
“The victory is very liberating,” said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate depth with the Out in the Europa League on Thursday.
“The success experience was incredibly important,” confirmed Captain and Torschützte Steffen Hofmann, who presided over the third place with Green-White.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid on Siegerstraße Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second season win and goes into the country game break with a success experience.
“We wanted to show a positive response,” said outside defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership volley from the sixteenth grade in the 14th minute, put the softs on victory.
“I thought I was going to get all the frost in on Thursday and cut it under the latte, meaning the 26-year-old smiled.
When Schrammel hit a Bundesliga party for the last time on 13 Novmember 2010, it was still for riding.
The first championship striker in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in special memory.
“For me, it’s something very special, I’m from the Rapid-adult,” Schrammel said.
Due to Mario Pavelic’s short-term basin injury, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and also made his case very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also perform this position in a mirror manner.
The gate he earned, he has already performed some assists — he praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after well an hour, which finally made the decision.
For this reason, the guests could also have written before.
“God thanked us today,” said Schrammel, who has also noticed that this has resulted in the clash of performance and result over the past few weeks: “The results have not voted, but the player has always been good compared to last year.”
Barisic even found that “in many games earlier than today,” one was against “the strongest team played at this stadium this season.”
The first three-pointer since July 26 has therefore proved that the team load has been the setback despite being intact: “Today my team has shown that it has character”
For him, it is no less enjoyable: “That we have finally played too zero again”
A lot of work during the national game break Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger to complain several failures, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their starting debuts made the win even more valuable.
“You must not forget that,” said Barisic, who lost in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, “who have been very stable in recent times.
The national game break therefore had to be used to “lick wounds and put a bit in the physical area,” said Barisic, who has five U21 electors in his ranks.
One of the places where the break is most likely to come from is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks up for the team, is about pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us — Barisic stated.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before its outing in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also reached the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga match, it was the first hit from the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: “Don’t believe that everything is good now — we certainly have had a bit of luck, but at some point happiness has to come back to us.
Now it was the highest time, Hofmann said.
He freely warned about focused further work: “You can’t always see it black and white.
We haven’t played as bad as this has been shown in recent weeks.
We must also not believe that everything is good now.
He could not argue the importance of his role for the team.
It’s a very young team that I can help very much right now.
They are still holding on to me at some point in time,” Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to do with his team.
He regrets the quick opponent “from the Magictor category” as well as the regular gate of Use in the 40th minute, which had been denied to be wrong by arbitrator Collegger.
The only probation I can make to the team is that we were towards Tor in some stages not concrete enough.
We had too little conclusions.
In-house defender Maximilian Karner looked similar: “It started as bad as it started, but then we found out and even made a gate.
There would have been more in and around.
Under this Whipfel reigns Ruh
We showed a powerful strain in our puzzle task of the summer series - My piece of Rhöner Glück - last Friday.
Several of these tree giants are still in the county, the pictured specimen is the \"geek rest\" above the underwhite brown.
A Holpriger footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak.
It passes through groups, basalt stone caves and basalt stone lakes.
A piece below the stone break from Bauersberg, a mile north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it rushes beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds an American mammoth tree with a range of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystic place.
Despite intense research, however, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bishopsheimer Archiv and interviewed older people from underwear brown to learn what kind of relationship it has with the gecko.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Until about 80 years ago, the goat-hairs should have driven their animals from underwhite brown to the hard-red and stone-free ways.
At the foot of the tree, the animals that have been exhausted by the rise should have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the ways, goat herds actually feed again.
The region has also been explained as the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further found out.
When entering the stone collections, however, you should be careful to avoid, for the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place for cruisers.
A hiking path leads from underwhite brown to the tree, but which is somewhat hidden.
Further paths are outlined, the direction of the high elevations is up and invited to an extended hike.
Where is the Wasserburg?
However, a Wasserburg, who is looking for our next task, is more rarely found in the height.
The mirroring in the tomb already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the county to which the building could fit counterfei.
Where is our “piece of Rhöner Glück”?

After weeks of dubbing, Italy’s Prime Minister and Deputy EU Chairman Matteo Renzi has held the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy last week, she is a successor to British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers the government’s close daily newspaper La Repubblica to be a favorite in the government team to strengthen the position of social Democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects an uplift for his “reform package” in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes to make the left-party base which is always sought-after against him quiet, because Mogherini is assigned to him - albeit more in a moderate way.
As opposed to the Conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland, which was nominated as President of the Council, Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion in Rome will make a political compensation.
The chief diplomat of the EU will also be deputy of the Commission President Juncker.
The outstanding approval of the EU Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an important recognition of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica is spreading optimism that for almost two decades, it has been proven in leading party offices and that Mogherini, known for her ambition, will face the “normal challenges”.
The mother-in-law is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (left-wing Democrats), which joined the Catholic Central Party of Margherita in 2008 to form the present-day Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists).
With the 2001 election in the Left Democratic Party Council, she entered the high party policy, working in the Foreign Policy Department, whose leader she soon became.
It occupied traditional focusses of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known by studies on NATO use in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a military contingent, held contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert in defense and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became premier in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country today, which contributes to the party's over 40 percent vote in the May elections, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The remains in Brussels, the new EU foreigner has too little diplomatic experience, so they fail to provide substance, is reported in the PD.
In Brussels, especially from Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini's realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being followed, and it is a \"routland-friendly course\".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi had entered office as EU chairman in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first visit to the state.
Photos they showed with Putin at the Shake-hands were taken in Brussels with outrage, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief to a Milan Economic Summit for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at Emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This is an Azubi which has previously completed another training in the company.
In four training professions, the new employees will work in the future: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Buchel from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg in the form of Forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Zörfreis and Sebastian Zahner from Pfrömd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended primary or secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all ages and the instructors go to Oberammergau for a team training event, where, among other things, a full-day migration and rafting are on the inside.
The company has a total population of 435 in Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed over all the years is 27.
The socialists in France should “keep their mouths open and put France in order,” said Francois Hollande’s most important ally.
Mr. Valls called on the deeply split left to show \"his love\" to the controversial socialist president whose cabinet reformation was in the hands of the vast majority of French people.
The President deserves everyone’s respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
“It’s our duty to stay on his side,” he said with great applause.
As a critical gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government will not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce demands for a lockdown to the regulation of Emmanuel Macrons, the new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande had called on his fellow socialists to show \"united\" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, strangled Sand into the gearbox in which she appeared at a meeting of downtrodden socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French “believe in their future.”
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, ridiculed the constant battles of the socialists and said they could not imagine the new Valls government going through for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old did not even survive a summer.
“And the new will also not survive autumn or winter,” Ms. Le Pen told supporters.
She repeated her party's call for a resolution of Parliament and said she was confident to stand out as a winner in preferred elections and was ready to go to the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections and the right-wing National Front was at the top of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the danger of falling into several rival factions before the end of Holland’s 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to achieve an improvement in the economy and the record unemployment numbers.
“There’s a small window for opportunities, but public opinion needs to feel fast that things are changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may worsen further.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norway Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, leads advanced negotiations, according to industry experts, to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises as well as its prosperous customership, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20% share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesperson for Apollo rejected a comment.
The Norwegian Cruise, located in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand name Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is a total of about $29 billion and in the next few years, due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice among cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises appealed to the U.S. regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
Ghenting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP an 8 percent share in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together have over 82 percent of the passenger capacity in American cruise ships according to the original application documents for Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hongkong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A peking faithful group swung close to the Chinese flag.
The Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law on Sunday, which allows only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the majority support of a nominee committee, which is expected to be occupied with peking faithful members.
This decision will make it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be approved for election and will lead pro-democracy activists to observe their threat and, with Occupy Central protests, to defame Hong Kong’s financial site.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and the party leadership of China fears that the reputations for democracy are expanding to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Book, in which China's rule over Hong Kong was issued in June, democracy activists held an informal referendum on the election procedure in the Special Administration Region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organized a seat-in.
Lis survey is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese connecting office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Permanent Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Vice Director of the Hong Kong Office of Affairs and Macau of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be questioned over the course of the day.
Student activists announced meeting in the afternoon in front of the office of the top leader in Hong Kong.
Britain did not provide any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to take up \"statehood talks\" with the Ostükraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin requested Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government put up the fights against the separatists in the east of the country and directly with negotiations on the “statehood” of the southern region.
His spokesperson Dimitri Peskov later made clear that Putin did not mean that the region under the control of the separatists would be part of Russia, but that its status to Ukraine would have to be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin’s call to the Kiev government for negotiations with the pro-Russian insurgents seems to fit the strategy pursued by him five months ago: aid for separatists in taking territory and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed region of Novorosija factual independence for an alliance with Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with the state television channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukrainian Peninsula Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently referred to the occupied area as \"Novorosija\" or \"New Russia\", a term that reminds us of the pre-revolutionary period of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Oct. and while civil parishes in the areas held by separatists, are hoping for brief peace talks — caught in their illusions — reported Itar-Tass.
“We have to take up detailed discussions right away, not only on technical issues but also on the political organization of society and the state status of the Southeast Ukrainians, in order to preserve the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said Putin's reference to statehood in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months, in order to break fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
It’s not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it’s not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine.”
The cremation of the Kremlin spokesperson for the correction of the “fell interpretation” of Putin’s remarks underlines Russia’s leadership claim in dealing with separatist rebellion in the East as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties to annex the regions of Donezk and Luhansk in the Ostükraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russians and polls from the time before the conflict resulted in a wide majority for the rest of Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would allow regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, giving Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian state territory to Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea five months ago is the home port for most of the Russian Navy as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov area in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories, and casting plants, which produce important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his speech on the introduction of the 7th June that Ukrainian legislation, after re-elections, should consider additions to the constitution, giving the respective areas greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armament and uproar Moscow is accused.
Putin's last call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders at eye level followed after a further advance of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded the previously peaceful region along the Asovian Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took over in the hands of Ukrainian security officials, who, according to fears, are the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Novoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have been launched to secure Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoasovsk and narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday, asking urgent action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
“We’re just in front of a point where there’s no back,” Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide any concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia to take effect in an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanker colonies and 1,000 soldiers finished last week in the Donezk region to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first likely 63 Ukrainian soldiers included in the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian parachute hunters captured in the Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko announced on Sunday.
Naked photo scandal around Australian promises and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no heck of his anger over hackers who probably stole nude images of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who the A-Promis from Hollywood.
The film city is excited after a series of distinct photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence in a hacking scandal are shown on the internet for promises.
The hacker responsible may have 60 nude photos of Lawrence, Star from “the tribute of Panem” and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne have also been reported to be public in private photos due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 promises on the list.
Edelsten, who had committed to Grecko last month, said to Confidential: \"It's against\"
All private letters and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York City, reports that according to a news website, the hack \"is shameful, and that the affected \"is hurting\" themselves.
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-girlfriend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which she is on top without in a pool.
Palmer’s works include “Love is invincible” with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the available images yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence said to TMZ: \"It's a horrible violation of privacy.\"
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: “Posting hacked images from a cell phone is nothing but the sale of Hehlerware.”
The spread of stolen images should not be tolerated by law.
Radler, Jogger and Wanderer were on the Große Feldberg on the 8th yesterday and thus supported the association “help for cancer-stricken children”.
The tour for which one was a tortur was an easy training for the others.
In one, however, everyone agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski may have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus was driven on the Feldberg with the wheel yesterday.
For the good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle skater there, especially since he has personally brought a valuable knowledge to himself in the 8th wheeling on the Große Feldberg in favor of the association \"Help for Cancer-Sicked Children\" (Frankfurt).
It's a great thing.
\"I know now that I can do that - fine -
Small pussies on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Upper Ursel City Parliament, many of the 718 attendees were moaning to mountains yesterday in the early twenties and came close to the exploitation, but happily arrived on the Plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the 11-mile-long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
For example, Norman Dießner.
The very red green politician from the county day - red dress, red bike - made a little more on the start-up to understatement - every amount of professionals, there's arrival the target - but then proved to be half a professional on the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also passed through the route in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, a press spokesperson for the city of Oberursel, who had gone along with Frank Greeneisen.
For the two triathletes, the \"Feldberg puzzle\" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: \"This is about charity, we're happy with it - we've made an exit today anyway - so Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had been down to Oberursel in the morning to straddle up to the height immediately.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had moved to the saddle at 9:00 a.m. in the morning, \"made\" the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
Fun also had 'fritten-toni'
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosks, cycling tours across the Feldberg are simply included.
He had reached 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racing wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I'm happy to be there - Andreas Balzke said.
The trained Mainzer says he is an “ambitated race cyclist.”
He had to be, too, because he was on the road with the Fixie wheel, but that's also race bicycles, but without a circuit.
The fact that even without a wheel went up slowly proved not only the 20 hikers who went up over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit, but also a jogger who at a cord had a car tire with weights behind them.
Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with all-wheel bully and quad, said: “They know - I from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled rail, only that he keeps the sled on his own - so the man is somehow his own sled dog.
The 718 participants — and thus as many as ever — were sent to the route in the morning in groups.
The hikers first at 9.30 p.m.
It was followed by the first cyclists and runners at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikes were released.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the Association - Radelen on the Große Feldberg - gave the launch commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes that it will be possible to block the route to the Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
