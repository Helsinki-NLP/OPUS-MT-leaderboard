A Republican strategy to oppose the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by stating that the electoral fraud in the U.S. is rarer than the number of people killed by the lightning strike.
Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for implementing the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have announced new laws since 2009 that make it difficult to register or run the program.
This phenomenon gained importance after the November 2010 elections where 675 new Republican representatives could be listed in 26 states.
As a result, 180 drafts were introduced only in 2011, which limited the exercise of electoral law in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a light picture and provide evidence of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, declaring the right to invalidate himself as an electorate on the day of election, and agreeing citizens with the right to vote for which there is a court act.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state has requested voters to provide a light image identification.
Indiana was the first state to raise such a demand.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana's law in 2008.
Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states.
Over the last two years, they have promoted a light-image ID in 34 state legislations that force voters to present a light-image ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, the U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of the U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible persons, do not have a certificate of light exposure issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a certificate.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often to be paid to obtain the required identification.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected by young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required light card.
That's enough.
Students who are considered electors who give their voice to democratic candidates are not allowed to use their light image IDs issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs to choose more strongly for the Republican side, using the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Prior to 2004, no state had requested proof of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first state to make such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures aim clearly to limit the Hispanic votes.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators in 2011 have promoted eight state laws that eliminate the registration of voters on the election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaign for voter registration in the 2004 general elections contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
As a result of the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of new voters’ registration in 2010 has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted five other state laws aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African Americans, although they made up only 13% of the state's voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter made up only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites, who represented 76% of voters, made up only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters have violently opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several drafts of legislation were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 state laws have adopted that require the display of a light image ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of electoral law more difficult.
Democratic critics promote the party political nature of the adopted laws and see in them as a clear objective the impact of the results in the countries which are eligible for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that have adopted these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required in the electorate to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election decision-making.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostata cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test has sometimes shown erroneous results, with false negative or also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a greater delay of the men already undisclosed for carrying out early recognition tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have received the opinion of two medical professionals.
In the studies conducted in the U.S., there were numerous disruption factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early recognition.
This study has also shown that, when observed after 12 years, the probability of metastases being formed is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
That’s why I recommend the test from the age of 50 and 40 if you have a direct relative who was already diagnosed with prostate cancer.
For men of African-American origin, there is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been identified.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must be made really understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancers may remain untreated if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is more likely to take an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, there is no treatment for many men in whom cancer has been recognized, since their cancer is not aggressive and there is no threat to their lives.
They are suggested to be active surveillance and offer treatment when the disease progresses.
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not.
That’s why I recommend carrying out the test anyway.
However, it is most important to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be performed or not.
In collaboration with the International Society for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that allows you to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there are no miraculous means to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress made in research, accepting a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting sick.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all would eat well and move sufficiently.
“If there were no smokers anymore, that value would rise at least to 50%,” says André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of the cancers are caused by inheritance.
Many remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It greatly harms people's health.
“Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said André Beaulieu.
Encouragement data: 10 years after leaving the cigarette, the risk of cancer decreases by half.
The Weight
According to the Canadian cancer society, overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, grim intestine, mast intestine, digestive tube, belly, and uterus cancer.
“The research shows that regular physical activity during the entire life protects against cardiovascular cancer,” he added.
The Nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of getting sick with a grim or mast intestine cancer.
Wearing goods should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smelling, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“Latters can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer,” he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the link between vitamin additions and cancer.
However, your research is not very close at present.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found out the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly shown.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family predisposition.
“The execution of an early detection test does not lead to cancer.”
The Higgs-Boson Analysis
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs-Boson has aroused a certain outlook in the last summer, and this for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or least false - explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but empirically has not yet been observed.
But for the physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it really is the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it closely resembles the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this appears to be confirmed by new data presented at a major physics convention in Kyoto this week, but there is still no data to be completely secure about it.
However, let’s assume that it’s actually the Higgs, as there seems to be only a small risk of being deceived, and we’re looking at what’s going on.
In this world, there is a necessarily inconvenient law that causes two objects to not be present at the same place at the same time.
It's not possible to violate this rule - and don't try to make it too strong as you'll get hurt.
For even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law applies to them: the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same “quant state,” where this “state” consists of some of its properties in a large and whole way.
From there, physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens who are referred to as Fermione and obey the Pauli principle in a similar way.
And in the other, the bosons, an evil band of anarchists, who are nothing sacred, are not in any way moving this principle, which means that they can actually be at the same place at the same time.
According to The Article Adventure, these bosons are joined by the Berkeley Labors (which, by the way, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the mesons that we will not treat here and the \"power particles\" by which the great forces of nature are spread and which the Higgs-Boson would somehow be related to.
It must be emphasized here, however, that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the light particle, which is the “Both” of electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is \"crushed\" exactly at this location in the form of a silica stone thrown into a pond.
This “disruption” creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons’ carriers of force.
Stable Field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, has to be \"stored\" so that this boson will show up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the reaper must achieve very high energies, a little similar to a frozen pond whose surface could only be torn by a very large rock.
That is why a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold itself on the refrigerator.
And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass while the others (like the photon) do not have a mass.
For what can all these research now be \"good\" Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science, they serve to review the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicists to scrutinize all differences between the observations and predictions of the SM.
There are numerous physicists, on the other hand, who hope to find such deviations, since the smallest difference could open a door to a “new physics” and stop some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still has great shortcomings as it does not provide an explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (renewed ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found until now.
Impact
The effects of these research for the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no one.
By the way, in the early 60s, the pioneers of the laser in Bell labs did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but otherwise nothing else.
In fact, the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who in 1962 himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) - has already said that the laser was considered at first rather than a lab game.
Just imagine...
In addition, applications can also be derived from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics in 1969.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as “eye” and has introduced it to the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you can't really know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die...  Le Devoir
With its Committee on Death in Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the heaviest question of the end of life.
The debate needs to be resumed in the near future, although a legislative bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important subject area.
Le Devoir tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had left him a period of two years.
“They gave me five years to live, I succeeded seven years,” he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gabberrys in Beloeil, where he arrived on the previous day.
“It’s always a shock, but you can’t be prepared for it,” he says.
The disease does their job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
At the table in front of a delicious lunch, he consents to help with the meal.
Courageously, he even succeeds in smiling and speaking to the strangers who are around him, bringing him his medication, and offering him a bath.
The Courage of Normal Death.
“My greatest wish is to heal my breakthrough, as it is humiliating,” he said.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
“In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is pinning in the stairway,” says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the home of Victor-Gabberry.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
“It depends on the person’s ability to take a step back, he notes.
Several people working in palliative care have seen large events taking place in the midst of these retreats.
The patients who are assigned to the Home for Palliative Care Victor-Gabemia are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer burdened by the doctors and nurses who care for them with so-called “healing” care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years of age, the worst fear is to die \"consciously and by constipation\".
But through the disease, I really got to know my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
“I don’t have any more wishes in life,” she says before accepting that you put on a mask that helps you breathe.
She still expects a last visit from her son from Italy in the next few days.
In the home of Victor-Gabberry, you can offer a group of voluntary body care and assistance in eating.
Palliative care is then used when there are no other options.
To make death more pleasant.
In Quebec, 11,700 residents come to bed for palliative care.
That’s very little if you take into account that one day we will all die.
Here life will continue under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The deceased is granted oral care with Brandy or Pepsi, depending on his wishes.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help members and patients alike,” reports Care Director Nathalie Savard.
In the home of Victor-Gabberry, there is no day like the other.
In addition to a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family meeting in the yard and is well cared for by his head pillow, as one approaches his honor, a 36-year-old young man who is surrounded by his parents, his wife, and his two little children dies tragically after he has tried everything to survive.
“For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients under the age of 45,” Dr. Christiane Martel says.
53% of the patients assigned to the home of Victor-Gadbois come from their place of residence, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e., care that should alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Home Victor-Gabberry and the Society for Home Palliative Care in Montreal, are specializing more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
That is exactly what this major inadequacy in Quebec’s health care ensures that several doctors in palliative care face concerns about the adoption of a law governing death aid and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto in circulation has been signed by prominent palliative care personalities such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to oppose such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to go over to death aid.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days of great pain in the emergency treatment without taking measures to relieve her.
I fear that the patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are treating their patients in spite of the worst prognosis to the last day.
Hélène Richard’s chances of survival were already minimal when she discontinued a complaining chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I would stop the treatment, she replied that she regrets that I was giving up the fight, she told me.
But she told me that I was in the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thanks to the care staff that this desire did not take place after their pain was relieved by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care of the company of domestic palliative care of the Montreal Grand Room, 8% of patients do not address pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, doctors often resort to the terminal sedation, which goes on to intrude the patient either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can’t do more than we don’t perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will be more and more likely to have access to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved say all the same sentence: “I want to die”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean, “I want you to sleep me, but “I want my pain to be relieved”
The realization of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship of Canadian Health Research Institutes.
Candale of real estate in Quebec
Officials of the road construction office, companies of the construction industry, money-skilled political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell what they know about a great “system” in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso are engrossed.
An industry that was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s remarkable how the system has collapsed since we took drastic measures,” says Jacques Duchesneau, a deputies in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
The scandal was discovered by him due to an in-depth investigation of the violations relating to the road construction contracts in Quebec, which the Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed to do at the time.
The Dukesneau Report established a direct link between industry, secret funding of parties and bribery of officials.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stressed, “the Ministry of Transport alone has saved a billion dollars in the contracts, because some have drawn their instinct to keep their share!
The Charbonneau Commission “has already brought two mayors to trial,” he adds, hoping that it will succeed in showing her the tactics behind the individuals.
A 2011 permanent anti-corruption unit
The permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011 also makes great efforts with its troops to auditors, investigators and analysts of the government.
In addition, the police officers of the Marteau Force, which has been causing Montreal’s “canalization cardell” to take place in the artificial blasting of the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has made numerous house searches and raised accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal mandaters such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes in exchange for public orders.
On the other hand, engineers of the Montreal road construction office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia, have been charged.
The latter has been excited by the Commission's declaration of the functioning of the 'system' for the receipt of public orders.
For several years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mediator associated with the Mafia who overthrew the money to the Union of Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s Mr. Zambiato had his hand in play everywhere by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the Liberals who were in power at the time.
He was also able to organize an illegal media agency for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Channelization contracts, whose costs have been artificially charged by him
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked smoothly.
Former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of $736,000 as a counterclaim for channeling contracts, whose costs he had artificially charged.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they were lubricating themselves by artificially blowing the invoices with false additions by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately looking over a shadow budget that filled his cash box with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, which caused Montreal to fall into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first MPs to hit the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies city district, in the east of the island, from 2010 she leaned on the sale of a municipal property, which was purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million in building companies in the booming real estate market.
70% of black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation, which is eventually carried out, she says that she \"draws on a thread that allows her to understand the functioning of the system undermigranted by ants in order to stop the evil and accuse the guilty.\"
She says the procedure is “painful, but positive.”
We are here to cure the wounds, but we need a single investigation unit for Montreal, as well as a supervision to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to make clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, on the other hand, notes that “officials have stolen several hundred million dollars, but above all, think about the role of ‘mandatory carriers who are over the tactics in the picture’ if they were not engaged in fraud!
Based on a 70% share of black money in funding the electoral campaigns in Quebec, he said: “I have been told that this is only a weak charge of reality.”
The government of Quebec proposes to limit the donations to parties to $100, which, according to him, would not change the situation: “As long as the election campaign expenditure is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics.”
He recommends a complete review of the system for the granting of public orders and the financing of the parties: “We cannot fall deeper; by going on the ground with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws.”
If this story harms the international view of Quebec and of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh at throwing a look into their own backyard...
PSG is not the FC Barcelona
This season you have adopted a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I make progress every day on their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements set me up to improve my level of play every day.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I don't get excited.
Since my beginnings at the centre of the preliminary training of the INF Claire fountain up to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progressive progress.
You are therefore taking advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new visits of this summer are used to performing games very high levels.
You also know that each training unit is decisive.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer his forehead and give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makeelle, who played at the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
In Ligue 1 there is no comparable person at present, and it is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected associations.
He had contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from an injury series.
The confidence he has put in me is also an explanation for my performance.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the seat of the top rider.
But we're lying behind.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth final.
What is the purpose of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
Everything is possible from now on.
However, we will have to speak our words against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group before Porto so that we can play the back of the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for this...
In order to become a major European association, Paris has to win title and make a name for itself in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG provides the means to make this project take concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as it was in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really our heart to dismiss this title.
In the last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed, as we were strong enough to bear the victory.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Usually you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux ring the title, I think we have the stuff to win him.
Do you think the media is expecting too much from the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it’s normal for a lot of us to expect.
We accept it perfectly.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something that can be accused of, that’s certainly frustrating.
You wonder what people are still waiting for.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try to set up a game concept.
A team is building up over time.
In the Champions League we have shown strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the eighth final since two seasons, and that has also made huge expenditures!
In terms of the invested sums, you believed in the game break with 15 points ahead!
This meant that our opponents and the French championship would be left out of consideration.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good in the last season, were bombarded by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope we will be the smiling winner in May and tell us that despite all the difficulties, we have finally won them.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It is so much better to talk about a ‘Zlatan dependence’.
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That is why he came and he proves to be the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he played, he turned his eyes on being a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is really exceptional.
This spurs others on to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows all others to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from striking out some time.
I have seen things from which I have been strengthened.
Today I succeed in winning good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the \"Bleus\"
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our teaching, and today we need to set a good example of behavior on the day.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the “Bleus”?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the WM.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and excited to win.
It was also Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the \"Bleus\" to Brazil.
Is the undisputed divorce on 16 October in Spain (1:1) an up-to-date game?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone is committed to everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin, payment and sales without a bank is possible
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision can be seen: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolys, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc. convertable) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent that allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After reaching a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, Bitcoin’s rate fell to $2 five months later before it recovered to around $10 today (the rates are listed on Bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (EZB) has shown interest in this in a report published in October on virtual currencies.
It describes Bitcoin as \"the virtual currency with the greatest success - in competition with the dollar or euro - and - similar to the conventional currencies -
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the “Credits” that are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy through games (and sometimes also exchange).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed every time by a central authority.
With bitcoin, all net nodes are simultaneously keepers of the invoice, auditors, money-emitters as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the trading bitcoins are present in the public account book spread throughout the network.
The key step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done by a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a dismembering of the file, i.e. converting a large file into a shorter and clearer electronic fingerprint.
The computers \"take the new transaction and add a number before the whole is \"cracked\".
The goal is to find the number that results in a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to cheat twice (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain without linking, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred million pieces can be shared, leaving a certain space of play.
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with every improvement in the computing performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.
“The vulnerability used does not relate to the actual protocol,” assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money washing using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has this defect.
Important players such as Wikipedia refuse to donate this type.
They are accepted by others like the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the billing book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November a “mega lock sale” was launched.
\"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged - Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, is pleased to convert Bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are therefore cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and thus can remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by traders, and the latter need not install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify an address that can be photographed and recognized by a phone, Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are considered for the benefit of more horizontally oriented systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to get through, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicted.
The Committee, by the way, provides in its report to reassess the various risks that are considered to be highly regarded today in the event of the success of this currency.
We have been withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is at the time that the Afghan army regains possession of its territory, and that the Afghan people decide their future without expecting anything from us.
We punished the Afghan farmers in particular by viewing them as terrorists.
And we ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and injured.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who refuse armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when Western countries become more discrete.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nyrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was funded with French loans, was done correctly.
The truck and tank convoys flew by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer have access to Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996 the conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was overwhelmed by war because of the fightings of the various insurgent groups.
Their power acquisition was then regarded as a sort of liberation and return to safety.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscureism of the farmers overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mudshaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important characters of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into business makers by seized property from the government to sell it as a land of construction to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive American granting of sub-missions.
They took action, and most of them were not even involved in the fights.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just as those who could make use of American applications: the capital flight is considerable.
The young people have been filled with war and its ideology.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed their advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are possessed by mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now present.
Are the authorities whose commanding force they will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore militias in the province, which will withdraw from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from a certain decentralization, as the western nations do, but by the abolition of the office of the Prime Minister, which has existed since the Constitution of 1964, the U.S. wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential force.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional storage plants are not present and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruits and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country that was founded by 30 years of war, a state control of infrastructure would have been required.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense soil treasures.
This adds to the impression that the Western countries were only on site to empower themselves.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for an export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the copper mine of Mes Aynak, let the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) make their excavations at the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and young England, the Institute of French at the universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural field, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of civil-military actions by the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was appointed in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit work and measures to renovate agriculture in dozens of mountain villages, and have been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to win the \"hearts and spirits\" and achieve the impossible task of unifying aid and offensive actions.
These works, for which numerous local workers were required, may have helped to suppress the riot: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase agricultural resources.
What kind of Souvenir do we leave after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help improve local living conditions, which are often very hard in these valleys at a height of more than 2000 meters.
The message contains dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to be freed from the rebellion led by foreign groups, which according to their own statements is their desire, the continuation of small, well-controlled and directly related civil aid would be necessary in their favor.
A Constitution with the Breaking rod in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more than ever divided with regard to the Declaration of Constitution, which temporarily grants it unlimited power, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To surprise everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly will adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state granted this plenum two additional months for the completion of his work.
Egypt has now been relying on a provisional, multiple-changed text for almost two years, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal disunity.
This new initiative has only led to an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his \"autocratic delirium\" by continuing to \"break his word\" and \"step right\"
On the side of its advocates it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the brothers to abandon their projects, to explain to the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the President, it is also a way to rediscover his public and democratic legitimacy while protesting throughout the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote well.
In particular, the Egyptian people are put to an ultimatum with this retreat to an overcrowded vote: \"You either agree for my draft or I retain the unlimited power - the latter should, according to the adoption of the Constitution, take an end.
85 Most of the Islamist members of this constitutional assembly accepted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals did not comply with the call.
Shortly before the declaration of the Constitution in mid-November, they have turned their backs on the belief that they have not been able to bring their views into force.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted the same way.
To achieve the decision-making ability, 11 persons, deputy members, were added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were most unanimously approved.
The commentators, on the other hand, found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... in the time of the prayer came to be expressed, since some members of the body thought that the pendelier of the constitutional assembly was not going exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, finally remains the same with that of the Constitution of 1971 and states that “the principles of Sharia are the main source of law.”
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing “the principles” with “the rules,” which would have made more strict application possible.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
“Faithfulness” answers the Liberals, who only see this as a propaganda attack.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place over other articles.
In particular, they have pointed out articles 220 to the University of Al-Azhar with regard to the review of conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because “the people who are invited to a opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see in this the first signs of a theocracy.
The fears of liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next principal of this university may be far less moderate than the current one.
“At present, no concrete religious commitment can be recognized.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema, but academics who have been trained in the French system in part — Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral work on Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he boasts that “there can be a plurality in Article 220, since the terms used are derived from the religious vocabulary.
In particular, it refers to the “Fiqh” [Islamic jurisdiction, Anm. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to how far civil judges are competent to decide on it.
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is heavily criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these comparisons with the former regime are significantly reduced.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the request of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not presented to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations have requested to defend human rights.
The latter also communicates their fears about the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The real estate of the blasphemia is maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to free expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article refers to the protection of women, emphasized by Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the ban on torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The prosecutors of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await holy sites, the nabel of the world and a sea from Sole
The Promised Land unites in itself the glory of Biblical truths, modern comfort and an unspoilt nature.
AIF calls you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Preferring to the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It means that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the conversion of water into wine at a wedding feast, the going on the water, the silence of the sea tower and the fishing.
Even here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the saints are found in Jerusalem.
Believers go here on the path of suffering or crossroads of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the ointment stone and the tomb of Jesus is located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the nabel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where a Christian legend grew the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the complaint wall, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, there people leave different beliefs to sit with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Make a trip to the height
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding from enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 C.E. for his family.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters high above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins of their own strength.
Everyone else brings an aerial track to this historic summit.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters height is the famous ski resort Hermon, in which it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you get there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the mountain summit.
Unique Museums Visit
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
In the case of a trip, not all of them can be visited.
However, at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
Once, the Israel Museum is not far from the Knesset.
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in caves in the Judean desert, are preserved as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There the collection of works of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Bad Al Basha, which houses several rooms of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and baths.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum leaders or souvenir shops there.
The entry is free, and donations are rejected in principle.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The largest department is the memorial for the children, which was built to commemorate the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering space, there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died were blasphemed.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main recreational areas of Israel lie on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and ocean arias.
Amazingly, in the Red Sea, the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C in the winter months, and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and it is covered all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus even carries non-swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural saltsole) and salinity as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease, and for the relief of strapastic nerves.
Touch the secrets of old age
These secrets mark the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous sea route, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia came together.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to traditions, Noah built his arch right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andorra with which he led a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to slip through the narrow streets named after zodiac signs.
Fortuna is to hold the legend to all who touch the walls in the street with their star sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newly acquired couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo-terms.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can strike through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In the Roman period, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and operas are listed today.
Brand list for tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the journey is more likely to be taken in no euros, but in dollars that can be easily changed into shekel (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekel).
In the city you will most often advance by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a rapid railway and in Haifa the only subway line in the country with six stations connecting the downtown to the Upper Town.
This is exactly an underground standway.
A trip within the city costs up to 1.5 hours, regardless of the means of transport 6 shekels, which includes conversions.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and businesses are closed, and public transport rests.
On Sunday morning, the week of work begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, marine products, fish without sheep and foods containing both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with ham and beef, soups and desserts (made with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus pastes, various sauces, fried balls made of purified beans and heirs (falafels) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no straying dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
There are many well-fed cats for this purpose, which strut cozyly and unlit through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like invigorated places and don’t say no to delights.
Car rental costs between 37 dollars a day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance also costs $15 a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Admission cards for museums cost 30 shekels in section.
In Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists entered the Promised Land, corresponding to a 51% increase in 2010 compared to the comparison period, prior to the cancellation of the visa obligation on 9 February 2011.
“The Great and Powerful” Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While MPs and civil lawmakers discuss the benefits of the law on binding language testing for migrants, criminals are already dealing with false certificates
Every year, 13 million guests come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Your only goal is to make money for the maintenance of the families in the home.
On 1 December, a law came into force, according to each worker, to pass a test that certified knowledge of the Russian language.
To date, this regulation applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing industry and in retail.
However, the tests are to become mandatory for all guest workers in the future, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
This requires not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for obtaining and expanding work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also excluded from this law are those who received their training resources and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, problem and protection of rights
The totality of the examination sites will be under the égide of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of the People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can pass the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to launch the tests was supported by the Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, before the entry into force of the law in the press, citizens asked the following question several times: What does the whole thing really mean?
What changes do the regulations need to show language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
In particular, when speaking from the migration authority, there is a need to reduce the number of forced workers.
“Many are now talking about protecting the rights of labour migrants,” says the head of the Federal Migration Authority’s representative in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
However, your rights must be protected from their departure.
Only organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers at 90%.
Migrants with no profession, education, language skills, and medical examination were affected by problems.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will encounter people with evil intentions, who will place him under the guise of help in a dark, narrow barracks, where he will endure with dozens of his similar months without food and documents and will be created 12 to 14 hours a day.
Many complaints from our migrants.
“In the home, you will be promised one, and upon arrival you will be cheated, their passports will be taken off and will not receive the promised wage - confirmed by the head of the chief administration for labour migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripov.
Don't kick, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to make their money in Russia admit that they can hardly express themselves in their own language, not only in the language of the target country.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: few Turks, Uzbeks and Tajiks can also afford a reasonable elementary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, nor do they buy them suitable clothes, shoes and school things.
As a teenager, these children then take the first opportunity to earn money.
\"It's difficult without language skills - admit it.
“You feel humiliated and inferior.”
Citizens' rights emphasize the important aspect of the law.
The test only requires migrants with legal status.
If you do not have this status, there is no check and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers remain illegal in Russia.
\"Welcome to the Heart\" or \"Prohibited access to unauthorizeds\"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucracy and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are largely fake and we are not registered, and then cases of extortion arise.
“They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea,” Tajike Umed Huschkadamov told journalists.
“Don’t let any cost of false papers go -
Even on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only can the registration documents of migrants be fake.
Some false certificates that confirm the completion of the language test have already been seized by the Federal Migration Authority staff.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get this without a doubt: every migrant who hoped to save the tests paid for the document’s 7,000 rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs a worker three thousand rubles.
In addition, the most important direct task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates can not be bought easily, both officials and civil lawmakers agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guests who fall through the test for the first time that they get time for a language course.
In addition, newcomers are offered without the knowledge of language in areas where there is no need for active understanding with people.
Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal weapons market
Share of legal weapons in criminal offences extremely low
The Russian Ministry of Interior plans to strengthen the Arms Act for private gun owners.
The authorities are responding to recent events: injured at shootings on weddings as well as seven deaths in the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradov's amoccurrence.
Police want to ban the carrying of non-dead weapons in public and set up the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21.
The proposal supported the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the changes to the Armed Forces Act will be made in the near future of the Duma.
Not all are satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by drawing the screws.
An open letter was published on the Internet, the author's representatives of various armed forces were asked by the authorities to distance themselves from \"senseless sharpenings\".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, expressed by the criminal lawyer, Wasily Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the Department of Interior statistics, 142 crimes were committed with the use of registered weapons over the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a sharpening of the law for private gun owners will not stop criminals from serving on the black market.
At present, it is possible to find the authors in Moscow every possible weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior emphasizes that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
Weapons go over several channels to the black market.
There are five such main channels, telling a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who spent ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the General Staff.
screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during battles in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” Baranez says.
On the second channel are illegal weapons that are stolen from criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen both from the police's armed chambers and directly from law enforcement officers.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
In many military camps, there were often explosions.
“There is evidence that some cases were firefighting to hide the lack of weapons,” says the former military official.
According to Baranez, a contribution to the black market is also made to the arms manufacturers.
“Today, there are countless private armaments factories that do not stand up to international competition and therefore hand-wing the weapons on the black market, for example in Moscow,” the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
In particular, many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is a production of its own, sometimes craftsmanship, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling,” explains former military officials.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was written by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminal Literature, and publicly accessible data on portals on the subject of weapons.
The majority of illegal weapons come from the army and the law enforcement authorities.
Half of the weapons in the black market are due to “the debt of responsible men who have been involved in their work with weapons,” the report says.
According to the researchers’ data, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% go back to thefts in arms production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant of a weapons store, who does not want to be named, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long since bought no one, as they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more common for traders to worry about the aftershock in a gun camp.
A weapon, for example a gun of type TT, is purchased via a finrich.
The weapon is exposed and handed over by the fence.
“The dealer brings the gun into the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines,” he says.
“The police, of course, are aware of everything and therefore, if they cannot comply with the plan to detect crimes, periodically carry out check purchases in dealers offering illegal weapons,” adds the sales consultant.
“As in luxury store,
Buyers and sellers find the most common information about each other.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone noticed me and advised me to come to the “Begowaja” station, where a person would wait for me to break into a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
I only learned the price of the weapon there.
Viktor Baranez
“In order to worry about a weapon, I need a friend who has contacts,” the sales consultant tells me. “I have such a friend, but I don’t trust him.”
There are dealers in the markets, but there you have to go there and agree with a code such as “by Ivan Ivanovich, who makes provision that the daughter has lost a tooth”
I’m even now coming to some beat rings about a familiar one I trust.
He also gives me the beat rings, because he knows I don’t give him a hug.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military commander Viktor Baranez attempted to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to him, the schemes did not change.
He received a photo album in which “all possible” was depicted.
“I felt like I was in the luxury store, remember the military driver.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything out.
I as a potential customer not only buy but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target disc.
“I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we can negotiate with each other,” the expert describes.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in \"V Contacts\" where weapons are offered for various purposes.
There will be no need for any papers or there will be personal meetings.
“You only need the appropriate sum of money,” says the advertising advertisement on the website “buying camp guns or rifles.”
There users give up your orders and ask questions.
Is it also sold to minors?
“Of course, without a license, users ask “Iwan” (literally quote).
\"Cupe a TT. Moscow - is the Laconian request of \"Fedorenko\"
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless rail websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go to the service to go up to the network.
People come like hungry fish while feeding and then land in Siberia and may make coal
Military commentator and former military representative Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not find application.
The controllers accept the orders.
The buyer will transfer the money via a banker.
“When he answers, he receives a photo and a description of the hideout of the weapon — reports the press spokesman of the non-profit organization Pravo na oryzhie — Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that at the end of the day, you can also leave empty and get behind walls when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless rail websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go to the service to go up to the network.
“People come like hungry fish to feed and then land in the Siberian labor camp, and let coal go,” he says.
A Makarow for $100
When buying illegal firearms, experts are expected to expect prices from US$100 to $900.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organization Pravo na oryzhie, one can buy a gun of Makarow type for $100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by supervisors of mid-ranges.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of Interior, the number of offences involving illegal weapons across Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand from January to October 2011, while the number of cases of theft and extortion in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fast food and supermarket workers strike
Every fourth U.S. youth sits behind Mc Donald's money box at some point.
In recent days, there have been massive protests throughout the United States against low wages in Walmart branches and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will be further swallowed up or whether they will go out of the air soon.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of protests pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this industry of the economy has hardly been organized.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the U.S., attracting millions of customers, which sometimes led to handovers.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, established branches of the chain whose target group are persons of low and medium income.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart branches are between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the low-paying Walmart employees only buy at their own workplace.
The prices and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods only so cheaply because the employees are being paid poorly.
The latter also complains about difficult working conditions, such as missing fork stackers or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests on “Black Friday” demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to operating health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from California University in Berkeley prove that if the company raised the average wage to $12 per hour, Walmart would cost $3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than you’re now paying for wages.
If Walmart completely changed the wage increases to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
Each year, this would be for them compared to today’s more spending of only $112.39.
Walmart’s advocates are pleased to note that only in nine states there were protests and that they did not damage any losses to the company.
The Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart cash on “Black Friday” carried out almost 100 million transactions.
The company’s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that “less than five Walmart employees had put the work down and the protest action was just another PR-trick, the union that organized the protests.
\" Free Casses \"
The protests continued this week in New York, but their goal was not Walmart branches (which are not desirable in this advanced city and are therefore inexistent so far), but McDonald's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of servings, and yet you don't give you any sick days, and you won't pay for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage according to federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average, their simple employees in New York get $8.90 per hour.
Fewer than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible to get out of New York with as little money as possible, I am incomprehensible.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. youths were behind the corner after school at McDonald's, but the youths were still living with their parents.
Almost one saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now at interviews with McDonald's staff, I meet people who complain that they're coming out with this salary and sometimes even need to feed their children.
On the other hand, in the Wall Street Journal newspaper, there is a comment whose authors note it is irresponsible to have children if you don’t know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which started on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before McDonald's in 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which corresponds to more than a double of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits the management of the company from standing in the way of this goal and depriving or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, business management doesn’t make it easy for them.
But the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high personnel fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
On that day there were also many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting on lunch before McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: \"McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you don't give you any sick days, and you won't pay for your honest work -
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that “we should support fast-food employees together so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves.”
According to New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, of whom not all are employed in the fast-food industry, in which tens of thousands work in New York City.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
“The brain can only be moderated so far.”
The theme of the expanded reality that is popular with trailers of modern technologies is in recent times usually perceived by the lens of a special glasses.
First, in the summer, Google presented a working model at its annual conference, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also signed a corresponding patent.
However, in conversation with the head of the Group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glasses for the company’s scientists were only a transit station.
It inspires the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with mere hands and create virtual spaces.
- Please briefly describe which research your group is doing.
- We are engaged in the interaction of human and machine, but want to extend the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, mankind has mostly remained stuck in the phase in which pixels are worked on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
However, we want to predict 5-10 years and predict the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox consoles and the Kinect sensors are a progress, and today no further Xbox is sold without Kinect, as all are interested in motion control.
- What is expected of us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many still play on the surface screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been crucial.
We try to change this, working on real three-dimensional representation systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user but also his or her environment be recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these troubled virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you don’t always want to inform everyone around you about his actions and intentions.
Actually, every type of interaction with computers is good, but each one in their particular niche.
For example, in the field of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and narrow, rather than with inviting gestures.
The gestures were recorded not by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but it could be theoretically reduced to the size of a bracelet watch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gestures and language.
- How?
- We'd ask you, for example, to give you this spruce can?
They say it and at the same time they mean it.
- Usually, I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to recognize.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at a particular time and what is not?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual approach.
I think that in the next few days we will have to work on developing new sensor types that will allow us to more accurately capture reactions from people.
This can be, for example, laser sensors as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What are your demands from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Thus, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of algorithms have more work.
It must not only be taken into account the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and open-minded, the current 30 fps in particular for gestures are too little.
In our laboratory in Redmond, Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with a controllable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors being closer to second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed just one device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
Kinect is currently working with three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It does not serve to calculate the object depth.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
Beautiful would be a flexible, kinect-like system in which we could play with different camera inclinations to determine how this helps us in the three-dimensional detection of a position.
If I remember correctly, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public as opposed to Google.
Do you not think that with regard to the application of the technology of advanced reality in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it's not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in the raised hand on the go, but I think the most amazing variant would be a \"changing\" extended reality in which we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud.
The glasses are a personal gadget, and in them lies their strength (finals can only see you), but at the same time also their weakness, because an advanced reality by means of glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also normal mortals.
There is a problem that the critic often points to this idea: There is no sensitive reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
In my lectures, I often say that the extended reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could certainly become the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection basis.
She takes pressure very seriously!
However, there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the “pictures in the air” something hand-resistant, for example, creating the interference of some directed ultrasonic rays in a particular point where the finger is located, a feeling that is currently but still as weak as pussing someone over the handballs.
There are also tapes for the wrist that affect the nerve ends in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
Have you tried to list the brain?
Do you think it feels what it should feel when you see something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will be struggling with for a long time, namely a person who is physically located in a closed room, who is instead in an open, virtually endless space; here we work on concepts with running bands (other than in fitness studios), moving platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be moderated, and before us there are many more working years.
This is precisely what makes work so attractive in the field of virtual reality for a researcher: in many topics, we are only at the beginning.
Custom taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project \"Petersburger Avantgarde\", dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the reading list, high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene have already landed, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and who often find recognition in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the Extravagant Artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is home to Kirill Miller, the red-dressed beards that you can find at the Russian museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings or on Vernissägen.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are also exhibited, they attract large crowds of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg Avant-garde end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s.
He is also a man of the city, enchanting his fellow citizens by his presence on the street and providing them with a good sense of humor.
Recently, he snapped a turn organ and became Petersburg's spin organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role with regard to his artist's presence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer, which interacts with the optics and the image.
In this world, Red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, everything that makes a difference from the Earth Orm is called for to manifest aggressions and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Newskih Cultural Palace, where my work was exhibited.
I understand that I have to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters ended then, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I was friends with the painters of the new generation, so with the representatives of the “Gazonewschina” there, “Pushkinskaya 10” and then it was not until the end.
I draw it to the theatre, to the fashion, to the music, actually to everything, except to the literature.
- And all of this was united in your art clinic... - It was important for me to be at the center of Petersburg's culture, where the best artists should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a room in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there, until the renovation work, there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemia, the house of Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur came there with his project “Ucho Van Goga”.
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to play-back, wore tight jerseys, and among them was the composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it was out of their “Leningrad”
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of 'Halli-Galli'
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but the basics he learned with us.
The gallery “D 137” or the club “Griboedov” also has its origin in the art clinic.
Then our staff and tribal guests went there.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, there was a survey in the press that dealt with the award “personalities of our city”.
I won in the “Artists of the Year” category, and I had reached the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In today’s world it’s easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: one can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an undisclosed style.
- Many of my images are real pearls and clearly express the up-to-dateness and sharpness of thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme “The Russian Museum as Clowns”.
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and prepares to be that way.
In a clown, it blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grandkids, and I have great ideas.
For example, we save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothing and is oriented at the outside and not at the inside of the person.
But maybe you should not give a person your hand, but you should spit him in the face.
The deception disappears by dressing.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban spin organ player. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Today, commercial art needs to be careful, considerate and charming.
We see the collapse of the cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the simple people the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a one-hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to consider who you're going to like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- To the appearances of Stas Michailow, however, there are several thousand!
- To him, abandoned women, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, hence there is less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not destroy the reach.
In my youth, I painted such pictures that at a collector even hung in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually come at the end of my career.
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumers don’t have a culture at all, that’s something very different.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to be able to paint.
This is the culture I advocate.
- Kirill, what's missing from Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
It is said: servants of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real sars, it was different because the sars may not understand much about culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are now good advisors in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have what experts might be, but they will be blocked, as there is a need for higher-ranking experts who properly evaluate the first ones and release them.
Now only count your own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore need to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding feeding ground.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural nutrition, for example, because we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
This is much less with us.
Art has to be modern again, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded from grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
Birth in the world
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
caravans of spaceships with earth's inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the important question is how we can replant ourselves in gravity or on the replacement planet?
In my opinion, there are not many choices.
De facto, there are only two real planets that we might at least have been living hypothetically.
“Nearly Mars and Venus,” says the scientific employee of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, on the surface of Venus there is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at large or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in all.
The question of reproduction in all of them was first discussed with regard to the flora.
A century and a half ago, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of the land grown in the earth does not differ in the smallest of the Earth's species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, Wachteier was sent to the world to explore how the severity of embryos is affecting the development of embryos.
It develops a very normal cake.
But then the problem begins.
“The problem is that the kitchen needs to find hold; it needs to be able to stand on its legs and start moving,” explains the laboratory director of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without solid ground, the chicks were overcrowded.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns were completely muted.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
Four days later, they just died.
“Twice we let chickens slip and then set the whole thing up because it’s simply impossible to work with them there,” Vladimir Sychew states for the failed experiment with the chicks at all.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, only same-sex species will be found on the biosatellite “Bion”.
There was an experiment with rats that had already been fertilized into all of them.
In principle, nothing was specifically determined.
“That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued,” says Vladimir Sychew.
After landing, the space rats grew.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, humans could be principled.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not conducted out of ethical consideration.
However, women have been flying to the world for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereschkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our moon flew from it, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will they be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
“Finally, no one answered this question,” says space veteran Watang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after their space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, was born as a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman at All, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was in orbit twice and even performed work outside the spacecraft, had a son.
Nevertheless, a risk remains.
We only have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
“The more dangerous it is even in the face of flights in the surrounding area, the more succeeding Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet mankind must seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravity.
The hydrolabor in the preparation center of the Cosmonauts is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here, in a state of weakness, the cosmonauts win routine for work in open space.
The water represents gravity.
Even though adults feel water as pleasant, it is a foreign environment; yet infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders were testifying that life on the land had departed from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that a child is in the mother's belly in the fruit water for about 9 months, and that it can then become easier to get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth until the first swimming takes just two weeks.
“That’s too little time to forget something,” says Baby Swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
Thus, while for a newborn child the severity is a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of severity, the belly and basin muscles are very fast back and thus also decrease the ability to press the child out.
Well, let's take care of this through birth-inducing aids.
For example, birth could also take place in a special room to push the child out.
“But what happens then is the non-significant question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the Earth, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a load suit like an adult in order to exercise.
He will simply lack what is essential to his life.
“This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to our bringing a disabled, completely inappropriate person to the world,” says the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in the world has been a mere theory.
At some point, however, it will become reality when the earth’s inhabitants in their spaceships break into a distant planet that will become the home for their all-born descendants.
NKH Chief: Control of the Black System fails by debt of policy
The Czech Republic, in connection with public orders, has good control instances and adequate laws, but falls back to its application.
In the conversation for Aktuálně.cz, this is said by the Vice President of the Supreme Control Office (Sengvyšší kontrolní úřad, NK examiner), Miloslav Kala.
“A law is never perfect, but it needs to be properly applied - and this is not the case with us in my opinion - Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result is apparently also a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practice example, he leads the appointment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called Black System.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harm the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now banned or allowed?
“A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the chairman of the government, and the control office whose duty is once the control of compliance with the law, hinders his activity,” Kala says.
At the meeting of the Chamber of Deputies' Control Committee, you spoke of a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries were compared with each other on public orders.
Why was it concrete?
This is a parallel test we started with about two years ago.
Simply put, it is about the fact that the European legislature sets out how public orders are to be handled, and the national legislation is built on this, and finally there is still the real practical application.
All of this has been compared to each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we could find extremely interesting differences. In general, the laws may even be a little more “hard and perfect” for us, but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules, and one must also deal with the actual application of the law.
To what extent can the project be a help to you? What results from this project for you?
Such a common control could help us stop constantly trying to perfect the laws and lower and exacerbate thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economicity means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enriching or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even so that in this way we only burden the system with excessive \"paper cream\", and those looking for gaps in the system have much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech granting law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here, or does the system work differently?
As for the authorities, the German pendant is for the NK establishment of the Federal Court of Justice, which is similar to what we have and also has a college which is formed only slightly different.
The powers are also comparable to a certain degree, but Germany is a state, i.e. that there are also these accounts in the individual federal states - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH may only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of national accounting courts there.
As for German legislation, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would only like to compare this without specific details, but in some respects Germany is often referred to as an example, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in all respects.
Is this perhaps because the examiners are better there?
I don’t like that, but as I said, I don’t like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are a model for us also have to deal with problems.
Otherwise, they had nothing from a collaboration with our authority, did they?
With regard to Czech legislation, what importance did your authority have in the novelizing of the granting law, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this novel is only a short time in effect, it still does not affect our tests.
Since our controls take place afterwards, we have to expect some delay here.
To date, we are more likely to experience the impact of future controls in the preparation phase - so we have introduced and analyzed the new control instrument - detecting risks of ineconomicity - with this almost 14,000 public orders - here, of course, the changes will affect as the thresholds have changed, the conditions have been modified for certain types of tenders, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positively, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may occur that the rules become “harder” and can no longer be observed.
Under the previous rules, those persons subject to an examination to the carrier (for example, in the case of a operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) are subject to accountability to the fact that any non-conformity of the granting law corresponds to a violation of the budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense, then, to make the law even more strict?
I don't think that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have made a form mistake that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the exit here?
Let’s first say which way is not targeted.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not brighten the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called “black system” - what does that mean?
Is the black system now banned or allowed?
However, a law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the chairman of the government, and prevent the control office whose duty is once the control of compliance with the law in its activities.
He can say, “We change the law and allow the thing — but he cannot say that we do as if nothing would be.
The award law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain procedures - and this is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder is excluded with the best offer only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it needs to be applied properly - and that is what is missing in my opinion.
On the streets there are separate ice sheets, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there are some snow and ice sheets.
However, the roads are generally easily accessible, with increased caution.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the streets were well-suited this morning, a uniquely dominated snow and ice sheet.
Temperatures drop to -5 to -10 °C, it should be a little warmer in the day.
In the region it no longer snows, and in the lower elevations only a thin snow cover remains.
However, on the combs of the ore tree there are about 30 cm of snow.
According to the District Road Guard, there was a limited view due to fog.
The R6 motorways and the traffic routes of the first road class in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is offered, for example, to bridges where the highways are required and smooth.
At the same time, there are all traffic routes of the second and third road classes, including mountain roads.
However, snow remains on these roads in part required or exhausted snow remains.
In particular, increased attention is therefore required in the higher layers.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some East Böhmens roads there is danger due to ice smoothness, higher locations and in the mountains there is still an outlying snow layer on the roads, the road and highway direction tells on their Internet pages.
The road championships warn drivers of iceglasses, which can occur in particular in higher positions in the district of Pardubice.
In particular, the roads of the second and third road class can be reached in the districts of Lanškroun, éstí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy have been treated chemically.
Snow is especially located on the streets in the giant terrain and in the mountains of Orlické corner.
An elaborate layer of snow is located in elevations on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia it is mostly sunny or hotter today, and it remains largely low-fall-free.
Temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen District
The roads in the district of Pilsen are easily accessible today, but locally increased attention is offered, and the route is to adapt to the weather.
This is frozen in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it has been snowed before and the temperatures then fell, it can come to ice smooth on the streets.
There is also a place to expect with fog, but the view will improve in the course of the day.
This information comes from the district road championships.
The D5 highway is practically accessible, but increased attention recommended the road championships between 80 and 131 kilometers.
The highways of the first road class are mostly dry, but frozen.
However, in the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, there can be ice sheets in a section.
The highways of the second and third street classes are moist, and therefore the reference here also applies to possible required sections.
Drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequent streets in the Bohemian area.
Olomouc District
Snowmatsch has to expect drivers today who are heading towards the elevations in the Olomouc district.
After the use of scattered vehicles, snowmatch remains on the pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Nightly snow drifts forced the road championships to use, in the Šumper district, according to road management, about 3 cm of new snow fell.
In the rest of the district, the highways are usually accessible without limitation.
“In Šumperin district, snow remains in the highlands.
On the Pass Červenohorské sedlo, drivers must expect snowmatch in the direction of Jeseník - said an employee of the Road Management Šum limit today to the Agency ČTK.
Her colleagues in the district of Jeseník also had to go out at night, according to their information, the streets are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are completely accessible, but in the Šternberk district, drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the highways are still wet here.
District of Şstí nad Labem, Liberec District
In northern Bohemia, the road championships report several poorly accessible road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice sheet, the mountain road from Telnice to Kínice is blocked in the district of éstí n.K. according to traffic police.
Temperatures also remain below zero in lower locations, so that snow and ice will be kept on the streets. On the other hand, no problems are reported from the low plains, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Area, and the streets are usually dry there.
No traffic disruptions have been reported so far.
Ice sheet is reported in particular from the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, in the night cloudless sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes and from the I/13 road at the border of the districts of éstí n.L. and Liberec.
The road closure between Telnice and Knínice was required due to estuaries pressed from the snow load to the highway.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think is going to happen in less than a month of world decline?
This is one of those disaster reports that we like to jump on people.
With our band The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's decline.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world decline.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a national benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
We want to use the Maya calendar’s marketing potential, which is forecast for the end of December 21 at 11:10 a.m. tomorrow.
On the day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will be held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava at the same time from 21:00 p.m.
The end of the concerts will be about the time when the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a time zone about 12 hours ahead of us.
From whom does this idea come?
At first, I think we made up the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to collect enough positive energy to prevent world destruction, but we also want to think about the state in which we once hand this world over to our children together with the public.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and key trailers against the world decline, with the purchase of which we can also support people via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other interpreters, has also included the so-called anthem against the world decline with the title \"World Defeat\".
Even today, the hymn on YouTube is very popular. Will it also sound on the benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, provided that everything works and that the world is not going to fall...
The anthem is to be sung by all the interpreters at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns are broadcast live in a direct circuit from Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, Xindl X sings with...
How did you get to work with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We strive to integrate these people deeply into our projects.
It has been shown that most are interested in working with us, and have fun about it.
What is the purpose of the release of concerts against world decline?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, where we have been working with the Tap Association at the Jedlička Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by lecturers who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to look up the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a private building is to be built in which we then move into this project.
At each concert, several groups and interpreters appear.
What criteria have you chosen?
We wanted to put together a program that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support Lesbians, illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Searchý will take place.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar “great events” also planned for the future?
In May we will appear for the first time at Prague Spring, and also for this concert we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to take place in the Czech House in New York, and I personally would like to connect this with appearances in Washington and Chicago, if we are in the United States.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. wheelchairs need to be transported in the luggage room. We also have to carry a lot of instrument case and other luggage.
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems so far, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that I have sometimes wondered myself.
Even in Moscow, where we were most recently, there were no problems.
Through your abroad trips, you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with barrier freedom, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
To Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were just in Russia witnesses to the fact that everything is still in its beginnings in the East.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not disabled, where it is still unusual for someone in the wheelchair to be on their way alone in the city centre.
Of course, it is not even there that one prefers a wheelchair driver, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to pick up against the developed countries?
There are many more things in which we hang behind...
It should be noted, however, that improvement in the situation is always dependent on the efforts of those involved.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently into the public room, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not common for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in social events, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap.
Respect in the public and barrier freedom is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come out of our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly desirable personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you to establish a band in 1998?
At the time, I started as caretaker at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people interested in dealing with something intense.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxofon, I have founded a music AG together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our Moderator, Láía Angelovič, is supposed to say something out of control (laughs).
Did the band become known in the last few years, or was I wrong?
It is true that cooperation with well-known singers has helped us; we have also begun to advertise actively for ourselves.
We are aware that if you do something and don’t see it outwardly, your own performance does not exist in some sense.
Thanks to the EU funds, we can also provide good lecturers, high-quality devices and, among other things, etc.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the very beginning, I felt the potential that things could be addressed differently.
In the show business, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its way, as everything is considered new with caution and only after a longer period of time is accepted.
There are few really unique things, and I dare to claim that Tap Tap belongs to it.
The first impression the viewer has most of the time is of course pity; this is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely superfluous because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we must regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full-fledged life if they have the necessary resources to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed something, this is not only a progress for them themselves, but for all society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something well, you can’t compromise in many things and you have to demand a certain discipline.
This is my opinion, but it is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have twice a week of sample, have to complete preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then enthusiasm disappears at many quickly.
This is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them have been since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Lá accomplisha Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to join in is always welcome with us.
Take place on the day before the forecast world crash, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 am
Events are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are connected to each other by live recording, and it sounds like a common interpretation of the hymn - World Destruction - the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to provide the means for the establishment of a multi-functional disabled educational center, which is to develop under the name STUDEO in the Jedlička Institute in Prague.
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free, cards are available on pre-sale at Bohemia Ticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was appointed as the twentieth member of this space authority at a Council of Ministers meeting of the member countries of the ESA European Space Organization, and Poland is therefore the second member country from the former Eastern Block (after the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and has been involved in several ESA projects in the following years.
The path of Poland into space began quite early.
Even before the Second World War, Polish Cosmos enthusiasts were busy with space travel, not always giving them understanding.
I remember, for example, the presentation by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work — entrance to the Cosmonautik.
However, the ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years, Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, founded by Robert Esnault-Peltery and André Louis Hirsch, in 1934 for \"In entrance to the Cosmonautik\".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski’s globally recognized contribution to the development of space travel was, among other things, credited by being named one of the craters on the earth’s side of the moon after him.
As early as 1925, a railway-draisine was built in Poland for which a rocket engine was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the design and details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or to brake the wire.
The information for this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered shots.
The research work led the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents delivered, it is apparent that the research has been carried out to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted freely by the march of the German armed forces.
In 1937, in the press of the design of a photoelectric hunting rocket from Ing. Rohoziński, the work \"Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomma lotnicza\" was published by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Previous Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczawy Komitt Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was completed from the beginning of the war.
More articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society takes place in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space travel are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space company.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was not clear that space exploration would have a future.
As early as 1956, the Polish Space Company PTA sought to join the International Federation for Space in 1951, and in fact, the PTA became an outstanding member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became deputy chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He was in this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been involved in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh all 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 the Błędów airport began flight tests with the RM-2 two-stage rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - rocket RM-34 should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe high winds.
In 1962, however, further development was stopped.
Following the first rockets of type RM, the meteor-1 rocket developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed from this rocket, which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 litres of version capacity, meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height was 37 km in all three types.
From 1965 to 1968, the Meteor 2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a load of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
After that, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning that Poland’s accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Chechen Vladimír Remek.
The cancellation of the law on nonprofit work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court upheld the law on nonprofit work.
This decision made a lively discussion in public.
It is definitely interesting to look at the problem from a wider perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with dragless financial speculations.
Due to the great differences in the value of work (pays), there are price tensions.
Under this term, a condition is to be understood, in which the manufacturer tries to maintain favorable goods by importing them into economic competition by offering the competition to break up a larger market share and increase its profits.
To a large extent, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheaply there, or to give up their business. The result is a high unemployment rate in countries with comparable high work costs.
Since private capital does not bear social responsibility and thus also does not bear responsibility for unemployment caused by it, there is a need to increase state spending.
This situation is further reinforced by the fact that Mr. Entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus replace the total economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The careless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies where governments are forced to compete to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thereby attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population without regard for social consequences to private capital.
This is expressed in particular in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own population to accept the dictatorship of private capital in particular in the pay area.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic obligation in long-term unemployment, on the other hand by the circumcision of workers' rights.
The result is increasing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For several years there have been public food delivery sites in Germany for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such a low wage that the state must increase its income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of auxiliary forces employed in the German Bundestag.
The savings measures of virtually all EU states will undoubtedly run into the same state where people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a disastrous collapse of their social level (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a hunger wage on the edge of society, hoping that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
Does this mean that the question of where this capital comes from comes from?
If it comes from another EU country, poverty is just moving from one country to another; or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa, the workers are working for a fraction of the European wages.
This is all Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the state is not allowed to participate in its own economy with capital, and that plan economy leads to economic disaster.
The private capital persists closely in its view that the state must not interfere in the economy.
But then you have to ask yourself whether private capital does not influence or even direct the policy and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence of this is the existence of a practically all-powerful and all-current lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, mutual advantage, a legislation in which virtually everything is strangled but nothing punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department lacks financial private, closely linked legal enterprises with the development of law designs.
These drafts are subsequently approved in the Bundestag.
All violence no longer goes out of the people, as the Western Constitutions announce, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Clearly, the liberal Democrats are now rapidly getting into a situation as they describe Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesars and Pompeii’: “The state had long been in disintegration, and the offices were occupied with violence.
Against lubrication, through unlawful wear of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption became unrelenting, and the people went to the election with already purchased votes ... \"People with character did not object to offices, so that as a result of this decline, the state had no consensus for eight months ... \"It has already begun to talk about that only medicine in this difficult situation was a single rule, and that a strong man had to be elected ... Appian thought of Pompeii, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with the sole rule.
As it is shown, today’s society as well as in ancient times is based on the careless preference of its own advantage, without regard for all social interests.
Private capital has not been able to recognize and enforce the benefit of the entire society by its nature.
The result, today as at that time, is an unprecedented decade of elites who are not at least struggling for profound reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the careless liberalization of the economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's perspective, the decline of these regimes in favour of liberal democracys can be seen as a certain pause, in which the next round is already drawing off.
It is particularly disastrous that today’s elites face the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the older and newer history.
The cancellation of the law on non-profit work here is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore system-related.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state's capital participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Labor des Chaos.
\"...that nothing can arise from violence, or ever could,\" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose main verse in the Refrain is: \"...that we may not forget how fragile we are.\"
“If my sons didn’t want war, there wouldn’t be,” says the dying Gutle Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
They stand behind Israel and argue with their right to self-defense, calling the Palestinians terrorists; the others, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed by the Palestinian Arabs and describe the State of Israel as terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is in this constantly recurring wave of the killing and who is victims; ultimately, today's residents of Israel, including the self-government areas, were born into the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence itself.
It’s about opening the eyes behind the scenes, looking at who the 95 years of tension (as of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot country in the Middle East are, above all, serving.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them, and they come from my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influence the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
That which is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always those personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne was someone who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must stand up to the fact that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and its resulting power is not created within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is a particular one that could be referred to as the head of the crack (I don’t know if anybody else is standing over them, but I don’t exclude it) — the Rothschilds.
Much is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (reuters) was already purchased by the Rothschilds in the 90s of the 19th century in order to block the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in which background it has always been the stronghold of their power, the increase of their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they lead wars or rely on them (before the invasion of Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq, there were 5 countries, after which Ghaddafis had remained only four, with Russia under its central bank of the Russian government in the meantime).
Anyone who has always tried to resist this family had to pay for it with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as central bank, began to issue his own (proverbal) banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to eliminate the FED - he was murdered in 1963; MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the FED for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the global powers of the Rothschild led to the formulation of a plan to detain three world wars by Albert Pik, a freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at removing Europe’s major monarchist statehood, the second war was to break down Britain’s colonial rule, and the third war was to reduce the world’s population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide comfort and luxury and would also not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (the ecumenism here is nothing more than the forefield) and ultimately lead to the acquisition of absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chaos order from chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the FED foundation so that crises such as the ones they triggered in 1907 do not repeat).
After they had succeeded in triggering the First World War by the murder of the Habsburg throne leader Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Tsar Empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with Germany’s sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender (for the destruction of the Russian Empire, the war was no longer necessary), followed by the dissolution of the Central European Great Power Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the development of the Second World War, the bankers caused a late-to-date conflict by investing Germany with massive war repairs; by doing so, they created the condition of poorer masses, so that they had to subjugate only a sufficiently strong leader, who had named the guilty and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-people state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, who should take the function of a fifth agricultural minister and also take it to clear the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned created the requirement for the mass migration of Jews to Palestine; it came to first clashes with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler got rid of the chain at which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything went according to plan, it is only hard to estimate, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as was prepared for World War II by the war repairs against Germany, the state of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in exposing this war, the Jewish people, like World War II, become victims in the front line of battle, this time along with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (you only think of how sharply people divide themselves into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim of the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power at first?
There is a need to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, only have their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of fascism-related politicians loyal to international bankers who are doing everything possible to create a war with Iran, which could rapidly expand into a global conflict in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), and in which, due to Iran's control, Iran's just 2-mile-wide road from Hormus, over 20% of the world's oil supplies could result in a destruction of the world economy.
In what light do the words of David Rockefellers from 1994 appear: “The only thing we need is an all-enhancing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order”
In their notion, the new world order is a world of Lords and Slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth to subject this being to total control.
“And it makes the little ones and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a sign on their right hand or on their foreheads that no one can buy or sell, because he has the sign, namely, the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! Who has understanding, who considers the number of animals.
For it is a human number, and its number is sixty-six hundred and sixty-six.
The movie Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they called for the extradition of the destroyed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which had preserved the patronage over his regime for decades.
For the U.S. government, there was no positive outcome from this situation - they could not afford to throw the shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was not able to go through the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution into the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the United States' reputation, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to free hostages made everything worse.
The diplomats arrested were finally released after 444 days after negotiations were handed over by the Algerian government.
The fate of hostages at home called for a wave of solidarity as well as anti-iranic moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the message, six ambassadors managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring refugees out of Iran, helping them to cover up an extravagant story about their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports as members of a film bar that allegedly visited the country's screens for a science fiction film.
combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for “exfiltration” by Tony Mendez also required Hollywood’s cooperation.
To make the tarning credible, articles on this film project appeared in professional magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time, and the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic polytthriller, but at the same time also a so-called \"Caper Movie\" i.e. the story of a successful play, such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels change in the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and even in the film summary of the same situations, there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which are ironic and slightly overt, come.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA Center and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the floor, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded with this film a remarkable restart of his career.
A ridiculed actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor, he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third film after the crime No children's game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without grace (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film that does not play in the director's home-to-home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that the previous films of this director were based on the standard Hollywood.
However, this feeling is also demonstrated in Argo, where Tehran is \"played\" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the input sequence of the first-storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet still conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when somewhere the story moves.
A similar effect is achieved with his team even in fictional scenes (the false film bar on a basar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not offer many exciting scenes in the film’s mind.
However, with the little he works quite successfully, sometimes helping reality - which does not always work so elegantly (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is turned away from a phone call in America, or the pursuit of persecution on the launch track, do something interesting).
The weakness of Argo is its all too broad scattering, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters would have earned more space, and therefore they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film loses some tensile power. It’s a film that can be followed with a certain interest, and in this case the design and the retro style that reminds us of a thriller of the 70th year.
However, he only awakens enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that is alive to this day and as evidence of how overtaken are the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services, he is sufficient.
Air balloon blasting guidelines, bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which calls for an annual survey on the most absurd banking fees, has decided this year to organize the competition “Absurdest Regulation or Idea from the EU workshop”.
“On this idea, the EU’s recent plan to introduce a women’s rate of 40% in the management of major European companies was presented to us,” Patrik Nacher, who was concerned about the organisation of this survey, told Právo newspaper.
For example, the European Court’s ruling on the unification of the insurance tariffs for men and women is subject to the nominated absurdities.
Until then, women enjoyed a benefit in life insurance because they were objectively at a lower risk for insurance companies.
“More incredible incidents from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place by the end of February 2013 - told Nacher.
The controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the binding mixing of bioethanol into fuels that are naturally harmful, the further the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometer, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the Directive on the size of chicken cages, which has become much more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism also removed the factual ban on the use of the term “butter-cut” or the sale ban for traditional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU budget often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels are usually represented by one or more member countries (such as the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with veto threat).
Lobby interests also rested on the fact that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a “crumbling anomaly”.
The European Commission defended the argument that they are merely harmonizing the uniform national standards that would hinder trade.
The EU standards on fruit and vegetables have already been highlighted by the EU against the resistance of some countries with the indication that the previous guidelines would lead to a loss of food.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU Regulation of last year, which must be provided in accordance with air balloons when selling with the indication that children under eight may not blow the air balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU was referring to an American study that, according to air balloons, is the leading cause of the death of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using annual market flows.
Curiosis incidents also exist at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive concerning European officials themselves - anyone who takes an official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the theme for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The Server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, also nominated the EU Regulation on the extent of food supplies in the field of a Member State.
The EU thus established the highest volume of food supplies available on the day of our EU accession in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeded the fixed volume for mushrooms, which threatened us with a high fine.
The organisers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should get money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving funding funds for aid on funding funds.
These ideas came, of course, not from Brussels, but from Prague.
“We are disadvantaged by not having a sea.
We will apply for the EU reimbursement, explained in the autumn of 2004 by then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvests were very high and the state camps were overcrowded as a result of so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has a further route to seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us according to Palas.
The European Commission finally came against the Czech Republic so far that it organised a tender on the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding funds for funding funds offered by the Communities to the Ministry of Regional Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), in particular, should be the means for setting up funding applications for Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
However, some experts believe that regulations are more easily recognized in Member States as a target of criticism, the EU’s efforts to regulate regulation and thus the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union.
A more serious problem is the EU funding for projects that have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced by individual Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
Emotions also call on the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member countries in Brussels, must fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and not always win this struggle.
After a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name Olomoucké tvar attitudezky, the Inlanderrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename it to Tuzemák.
The name Rum may only be used for products made of sugar cane distillate, not for products made of sugar.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipans or the Parmaschinken is now also home to the Karlsbader Zwieback, carpentry from Pohořelice and Třebo, or the Saazer Hopfen.
With an EU brand, the Pardubic Lebkuchen or the Hořicer rolls can be brewed.
“People want me to save the Republic, but I’m just an amateur,” Okamura says.
Mr Senator, how do you come up with the idea to run for the President's office?
I am not talking about being a senator or president.
If everything would work without problems in our country, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer look at how the Republic has been looting for 20 years as thieves run freely while people are raising taxes and pension age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something that doesn’t like me, I try to suggest a solution to change this.
And since I am already over 40, and to that end independent and impartial, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a Senator or the President.
In the Senate, you managed to do it and then immediately got on the way to the castle.
Don’t you turn your back on your voters?
I have told myself all the time that I will take up the fight for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I preciseed this and said that I would run for the President's office if I was elected Senator.
My goal, however, is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we as a people are squeezing in the knee and in front of the TV, but making everyone who wants to change something.
To this end, the media, who want to rob one of honor, and who are willing to lie about the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
You have taken up the struggle for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with resilient claims of assets over 20 million crowns.
You have to change laws.
As president, you have no competence in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I used to make sure that the travel guide remains a free trade, and this could be done.
The problem is the small-minded policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, he will deliberately reject it, and that only stops the population.
As an independent party leader, I have a far greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that without drawer thinking and party dogs from every party, I can take what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me on the left.
For me, however, this right-link thinking is completely unnecessary.
It is important for me that we continue.
It’s not about whether someone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to connect people.
I support publicly every good solution approach, even if it comes from the KSČM or from the ODS, and I will also turn to bad ideas.
It's wrong for someone to call you populists.
But do you not confirm this by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach this one.
This can be referred to as populism, but all the proposals I have been talking about already work in the world, or they have been rejected by important experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you will only be able to choose the key words.
This means that you won’t get far in the long term in politics.
Or do you think that if you talk only long enough to the people, you will succeed, for example, to enforce the material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our side to pursue these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to ask the chairpersons of the parliamentary parties live on television to legalize the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the allegations would have to tell you why they refused.
A strong personality that points to wrongs can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only the direct election of the President, which was a merit of public pressure.
I clearly say that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
With politics I have just begun trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn’t work, I’ll return to the private sector in six years.
This sounds a little like whether Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a rescuer.
I know that I do not achieve anything on my own; therefore, I have talked to several well-known personalities about whether they also want to run for the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who refused to do so because of work overload.
In addition, I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered the fraud when trading light heating oil.
My candidacy began with the condition that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of voters did not go to the elections at all, and those who went have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district chiefs.
Do you think about establishing your own party?
In addition, I haven’t thought about it yet because I don’t have time to check the past of any potential party member, nor do I have the money for it at all.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign yet; on my transparent account, only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about wealth statements, how do you look?
I estimate my private assets to be about 60 million CZK.
In Prague I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about one million. And then I have a few million more on the account.
Aston Martin, by the way, was a children’s dream - James Bond always liked me, as he drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You're driving an Aston Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and don't have any money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but your own money you don’t want to invest in it.
That's not just convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make debts?
I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors shows that my program doesn’t get too much interest.
And I am not obliged to fight the campaign from my own means.
The costs of the campaign are basically taken by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live from the senator's content alone; for example, I could not finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your outcome?
Did you not say that you will go back to these activities?
But this is not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I took part in my activities.
For example, my deputy will be in the spring manager of the travel office.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live from something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that’s still true.
As President, however, I would set up my operations entirely.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not just in the head - for example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bookberg - 2 photos
“I love the building, it looks futuristic, and finally there’s something new to see — says Lisette Verhaig, a passenger on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby large business, says: “Well, it’s beautiful already, the house”
But I wonder what we still need a booklet for today.
All have internet, iPad and e-books.
No one is going to volunteer in one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a barely-visited sleeping town in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is an exceptional record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitants community has the lowest education rate in the entire Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the general formation and to build the seven fictional bridges shown on the euro-series as delicately brushed steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers recognized that there was only one way to become a lord of statistics: a library!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architecture office MVRDV, master of the great-grandchildren’ bar charts and producer of witty, yes often cynic buildings, took the matter with familiar ease and appeared in 2003 for the competition hearing anno with five books under the arm and a grin in the face.
And while the jury was still diluting to see and tossed with the axles, the frigid Maas piled up his read-out rendezvous of the size to a pyramid and ended his actionistic underwalled speech with the words: “Love city community”
This is my proposal for the Bookberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Bookenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million Euros were shed.
It is part of a revitalization project, including deep garage, supermarket, mail and a few adjacent residential and series houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Buchenberg was awarded the second prize “Best Library of NL 2012”.
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the faceless small town halls, which up to date had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a seamlessly ugly town hall, behind which white facades would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to be a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all, Spijkennis now has the first public culture building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: Bookeldorado under cheese bell.
Although there is an elevator that leads through the mountain mass, the true space and reading joys are revealed in the foothill climb of topography.
The air-conditioned interior is bright and clear, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street-laters speak the language of a public city square in an indistinct way.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
You’re already looking forward to park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Of course, the book shelfs are along the façade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is mostly impatience and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic space configuration on the head and stole the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the Buchenberg is skillfully used: in the center are offices, internet libraries, chess club, environmental center and house technology center.
A special pleasure is the black book shelfes, which are once wall-covered, once-brushing, once-stolen lands.
Opticals, haptics, and smell are foreign.
Even skilled architects and construction engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
“We wanted to work here with recycling materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the Stadtgemeinde Stadtgemeinde Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so, in a friesland farm one day, we have been thrown into an appropriate waste product from agriculture.
For many years it has been used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and in fields a millimeter-thin plastic sheet as a root material.
This is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile stops, two seasons, after which it is ripe for the spill.
For the library, for the first time in these quantities, the Vlies were pressed into four centimeters of thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is colored into a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like a sport shoe.
After 105 stages, you can reach the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-meter walk you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and potted ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but especially for the proper humidity in the literature industry.
Donations for the new soul
“You wouldn’t believe it, but this house is, despite the many glass surfaces, a show project in puncto ecology,” says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled with ground heat.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass storm, the sun itself appears to be in the interior for only a short time on sunny days.
The broad wooden glue binders, which are across the glass facade, serve as shaders and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest complete fully automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT branch, was already driving the way to the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
And the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even referred to the Bookenberg as a mirror of “long-surpassing soul.”
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
In this way, the optical gaps in the not yet fully-stocked library, currently 70,000 pieces, should be filled.
The concept has gone up.
The shelfs are filled up to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a semi-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for cirrhosis.
Thus, MVRDV has succeeded in the royal discipline, which is called the foundation of identity in the trade-jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
So young and uneducated she may be.
This is finally an approach point for identity.
Szabo: \"Germans need to play a bigger role -
Germany has been involved in the vote on the capture of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in U.S. relations, Berlin balances with a narrow diplomatic degree.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had first signaled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin was there.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I think it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also took up the voice when it came to setting up a flight ban zone.
This was finally implemented by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that's right.
This is because it is just changing its foreign policy away from a policy that has been managed by the United States to a German foreign policy.
It is difficult to say that the Europeans have no coherent and uniform policies.
So the Germans find themselves in between the fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still taking on their role, but they're on the way to a more normal foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as they have France or the UK.
What does “normal” foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to also take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain degree different from that of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude of the Middle East conflict and vote in the UN?
First, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to stumble the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That definitely plays a role.
But I wouldn’t want to measure that too much weight, that’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German consideration.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the U.S. by being involved in important decisions of the vote, for example in voting on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States, there is a great understanding of the German position.
That's why I don't think this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even have a certain degree of respect for it.
It still signals that it is being taken seriously as an international player and that its interests need to be considered.
There are several opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly expressed itself for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of the American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama may have quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so brightly excited about Netanyahu's policies.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that’s exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a bit easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead drive things out of their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
This is of course not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think that the Germans are clear that they have to play an independent role.
Does Germany see themselves in the role as the most important international player - does Germany want to take on a leading role at all?
Or is Germany still struggling with leadership?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a larger role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes a larger role, there will be a wide range of anti-German feelings.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
That’s actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It needs to be receptive to different neighbors and opinions, and that’s not easy.
Now, the US’s influence in European politics is constantly decreasing, but the EU is filling this vacuum at the moment, but who else is there?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and makes them a lot less popular - c'est la vie!

\"Mark protection\" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Dahinter hides an official designation registered in China, which has nothing to do with the origin companies.
However, she enjoys protection for as long as the actual namemakers do not complain.
And even then, it’s not clear whether they get the right.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in Taylor Wessing’s Office, who specializes in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week, a new case falls on my desk.
A few additional letters are already available to the successors so that they can register their brands.
So from Gucci you can simply enter Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can enter Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports item manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations from the Beijing brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the trademark of Zegna DF Puma, an art name that also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese world champions are in copy and in the injured intellectual property is known.
In the large cities, there are multi-storey shopping houses that sell almost exclusively copies.
Pattloch’s cases, however, are different: On behalf of his clients, he insists that Chinese companies from the brand office are officially entitled to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the “Bang Mingpai” a bee brand.
The word is oriented to “Bang Dakuan”
This means that women are the ones who go fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any debt
“That’s business-shaking, you have to fight it,” Pattloch demands.
\"The brand is being watered, the single setting disappears, the image damage is enormous.\"
The financial failures and the process costs of the affected industries go to the millions, especially in the case of expensive forecasts.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury items with a volume of 15 billion euros per year and the fastest growing.
However, deletion of dubios entries in the brand register is difficult to reach and go to money.
For up to nine years, the procedure can be pulled down, with uncertain output.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court rejected complaints because after the long duration of the accused name, it became \"market reality\".
If the accused has Pech, he will have to pay the plagiar because he hurt his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, who recently took over the German concrete pumper Putzmeister.
The Chinese are allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star until today.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was eased, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against Nahumer from Hong Kong and Singapore, who let the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any debt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admitted that in 2010 there were tights due to low personnel and space equipment.
Last year, however, we returned from the 'notch situation in the workplace to normality'
In this way, the stock of unprocessed opposition procedures fell by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than last year.
However, in the office there are still 81,500 allegations waiting for completion.
Adopting day by day costs a lot
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that for the 10th time, China has put together the list of new applications around the world, the authority says.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan were taken on charges.
This means that each registration in section 1280 should cost Yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, it costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that their illegal manufacturing of imitated vehicle parts was lifted.
However, the Nachahmer continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freuerenberg brand.
One has failed because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also rejected the Münchner opposition.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg got right, but the trial opponent continues to this day.
You need to be careful.
Now the case is in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, praising the professionality of the courts.
But he also says: “The process is extremely complicated and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.
The internal costs could hardly be determined, the company archive even had to look through a hundred years-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg, on the other hand, offered in vain a “high six-digit euro amount” to be reimbursed.
“You see how much we’re worth,” Wentzler said.
The dangers in Fernost are even threatening to move back to Europe.
Then, if Imitators are safe from unprotected brands there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freuerenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has long been abandoned by the Group, yet it was able to turn down the registration.
“You have to be very careful,” Wentzler said.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful about business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather, on the part of the foreigners — whatever is some kind of protective, even in China — as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg had been subject to his brand drama in the last act of his brand drama, the opposite side would have to pay license fees for his own name, Wenzler explains.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the relevant segment.
World AIDS Day: Stamping, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the Choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland, Aidswaisen is delighted about this.
The story of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there is the stamping: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women’s pumps and men’s slippers are looking for the clock on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-four.
Then, the voices of the singer slowly slow down - old, bass, tenor and soprano - tossed, enchanted, and chased.
And Fied Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his clothes when he brings them together with his smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Choir Imbongi offers a new song.
The fifty singers came from the age of 23 to 69, from the human geneticist to the housekeeper.
“Om’Obani” is not a simple piece, each choir voice has a different text and it is still in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Worldwide, there are about 34 million HIV-infected people, the estimated Unaids, the United Nations Programme for the Prevention of AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245000 Asians.
More than 40 percent of the population are HIV positive.
For 180 Aidswaisen in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa has found patents in Germany.
70 of them attend a further school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take on a partnership.
It guarantees school fees, school uniform and a warm meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storytellers or praisers.
The Bantu language can speak fluently in this room but sing.
For nearly ten years, the choir has been performing songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally brings them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
For 8 733 kilometers of airline from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal violence of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still live in simple clay and straw huts, a large part of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are suffering from the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, it is found in the small area where all of Swaziland is ill: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef.
Circumcisions of male foreskins, which have proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland are carrying the immunodeficiency virus in themselves, dying in the middle of thirty is not a rare thing.
During a joint African trip in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but most importantly the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, not only lacking parental care, but simply at all: food, clothing, education.
Without a school degree, there is no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
However, just a year later, the choir founded the “Voices for Africa” Association, which has since been almost professional in caring for the AIDS crops in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, Human Pappilomaviruses, Herpes genitalis, or hepatitis.
Filzläuse and Kratze are part of the parasite STI.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and Tripper are especially common among men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all Syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidosis (pilz), Tripper and Human Pappilomaviruses are often sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is comparatively low among heterosexual adults here - yet: around 20 percent of the HIV new infections are absent from this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections occur much more frequently than in other populations.
After European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, human Pappilomaviruses are common among young people.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are mandatory.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2,700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms point to a sex disease?
Infectious diseases may cause wounds in the genital area, complaints in urination, outflow, under-suffering, as well as blows or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide a hundred percent protection.
For in part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on by lubrication and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular investigations, especially in the case of frequently changing sex partners.
Earlyly diagnosed, most of the STI can be cured and subsequent follow-up can be avoided.
Through patents, donations and not least the gags that the choir sings throughout Germany, some come together.
“In total, we have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esitjeni,” says Annette Lennartz, the president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and persistent woman, manages funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans are well underage, with one of the grandmothers for example.
The gogos, as you call the old women on Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken up up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear on time each day for school lessons.
Anyone who has no one comes to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as well as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has established a nutrition school, built two chicken houses and, together with the American health organization PSI, organized that many in the village have made an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, for as obviously as the disease is throughout the country, it is the most likely to die.
A king with 14 wives
“Aids is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his exceptional lifestyle.
Polygamy rather than Democracy.
Among other things, this state-enforced form of life is also responsible for the rapid spread of HI virus over the past decades.
But also the many hikers who carry the virus through the country.
While there are free condoms at every corner, Annette Lennartz says, “but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - meat to bottle
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Chor travels through southern Africa every two, three years together and sings songs full of sadness, spirit of struggle, confidence and black self-awareness, many of whom still know the southern tip of the black continent from apartheid times.
A bus full of whites who sing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already pulled off some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The journey also leads to Esitjeni, where the singer visits her stepchildren.
Although the small village is rarely found on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
“Go to Esitjeni, there’s the light,” said the people there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometers of airline to Heidelberg, to the pompous singers in the sample room on Bergheimer Street, you see it also lit.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice on Mercury
The probe messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. Space Agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is the closest to the sun, there are frozen water there too, as results from three studies published on Thursday in the journal Science.
The probe messenger has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently in the shadowy region of the planet.
It should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that have been struck on the Mercury.
No one, however, is linking the fund of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unbeknownst to Earth’s citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are involved in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send pictures to the earth: small guckles in infinite width.
The image comes from a camera that German researchers have developed from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who orbits behind Neptune around the sun, Ceres is not a planet according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006
This picture section of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a “family portrait” of countless star generations: The oldest stars are known as blue points, harder to identify are the pink-colored “newborn” in the star circle room.
This star-forming region, called unromantic W5 by scientists, has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This squeezing glut of a dying star has captured the Nassa’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star pulled out in the dying process.
In the huge trifid fog, 5400 light-years away from Earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
The Nasa’s Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic birth tube.
The Plejad star cluster, also called “The Seven Sisters” can be seen at night with the naked eye.
However, with the telescope, the colors are better suited.
Like a red age, the Helix fog looks at the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius constellation.
Its similarity to an earthly continent brought this fog the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: as these came about, is one of the great puzzles of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn mountain that disappeared 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on coloring, recordings of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The recording published by the European Southern Starwart shows the several thousand light-years-long trifid fog in the constellation Schützte.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-parted, three-parted), since dark dust stripes share the glowing heart of the star's birthplace.
In the constellation Schlangendrager, astronomers have photographed the proboscis of a cosmic carambo layer: 400 million light years away from Earth, the cores of two fusion galaxies race together and become inextricably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
What technical abbreviations are not, they may be called Southern Firewheel by their nickname.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows a section from the irisnebel in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-year-old fog consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded the space telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
The brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way is located in this star's bell.
The star range always produces new youngsters.
This star cloud, also associated with the rosette-nebel, produces constantly new baby stars - 5000 light years away from Earth.
In this light-shining galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was not created until shortly after the start, when hydrogen was found in the universe.
Our insights into All: The most important telescopes
The telescope was to be invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei put it to the star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have grown ever bigger - and the insights they provide have become deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest long-distance.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope is located.
It allows views into the whole to be equal over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior life of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Islands of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Advantage of the favorable design: The telescope is fixed at its height - and thus limited in its mobility.
The hobby eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an angle of height.
Its speciality: the high power of light.
This is, in spite of a relatively small mirror diameter, enough to reach the world’s largest mirror telescope.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to all of this after extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the “Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence” (SETI), each computer owner can assist by providing computing performance.
View of the Observatory of the European Astronauts (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, which makes his name all honor.
With a total of four mirrors, the remote tube can also light out the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned on the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is to cover 42 meters in full - and is composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be expected at the very earliest in 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer equal two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, still looks into the sky with the Subaru telescope and IRTTF.
Also on Mauna Kea a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here is an illustration to be illustrated.
However, the most important impressions from the All deliver the space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, it has already provided images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been looking for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates had been identified since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture, the last start preparations at the Kepler Space Telescope are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot on board an Ariane5 rocket in early 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it should look for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Urknall.
Scientists assume that even at the southern pole of Mercury, there is ice.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger travels far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have been pointing out for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Through the 2004 Messenger probe - the first to circle around Mercury - scientists now have certainty.
Drink daily butter - and become 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblical age.
There is even a museum for sustainability.
A trail search in the country in which 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblical age.
There is even a museum for sustainability.
A trail search in the country in which 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is called wild romantic.
The small bus flows over the curved road, past densely forested hills, tearing rivers and simple farms.
Everything is green and gentle, you might think you are in the black forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is just a few kilometers away.
Here is the Caucasian folk group of the Talys, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as as as aserically and is very durable.
The final station is Lerik.
The small town is protruding with too much-furnished Soviet architecture, which does not even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too complaining is the launch of Azerbaijan’s capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours because the road is only one-way.
The richness that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff to the tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival, and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world,” Fatulayeva says.
She is the director of the Museum of Sustainability, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, another child was witnessed
But the controversial star of the museum is the Schaphirte éirali Müslümov, which is to be 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate, however.
And in view of the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems extremely uncertain.
He was born here in the region in 1805, died in 1973, explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he was to have another daughter.
So, at his age, did éirali Müslümov expect a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, a senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard from the high-ranking people in Central Asia.
“Obviously, there are also many high-altitude people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “even in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men living.”
However, due to the lack of documents, there is no scientific evidence of age, especially since there was a lack of personal status register.
Each day requires melted butter
It is true, however, that the people of the region around Lerik seem to often reach a Biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why are so many people living here in the south?
The Assyrian travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysians.
Museum Director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it lies on the diet.
However, the fact that the calories-rich food of the Talys is supposed to be so healthy that the meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink a glass of melted butter every day does not appear to be particularly plausible from the point of view of nutrition.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
It sits on the ground with a butter barrel, which it untidyly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and one daughter, both are long-standing grandparents.
Two children are also jumping around.
In the kitchen you will prepare the guests tea served in the typical, tube-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayevas’ white teeth are perfectly in a row and link, under her towel she hides long, dark-blowing heads, which her son proudly reveals in front of us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
“I never used Shampoo,” says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She has always only eaten what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, heirs.
I haven’t bought food in the supermarket all my life.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the post-World War II period.
But everything was better than the “loved father” Heydar Aliyev took over the rudder.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, who is driven around the nation’s father figure, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows hardly any bounds in Azerbaijan.
By 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took over the rudder.
At the same time, there is no need among Azerbaijan’s old people.
230 Manat (about the same sum in Euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for so-called conditions an amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayevas has a long-standing son right: “The old enjoy our culture of reverence.”
They live in the midst of the big family, are loved, cared for and happy.
If this is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word “human law” is missing in the Constitution.
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rivalizing announcements in Cairo revealed the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as the basis is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare with Pathos.
We need to create the transition.
“And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God,” he said on state television.
His speech was directed to the whole people, but most likely to the Christian Coptics, the liberal, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
Because all of them, so far hopelessly divided in a controversial opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a God-state on the Nile of Graces of the Mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
He has, said Mohammed Mursi, almost apologizing for temporarily cutting the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanding its powers to save the revolution.
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who wears a doctoral degree from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, about this is the Egyptians, the world is not completely clear.
Whether the judicious should be removed
In fact, the 234 articles passed by the Islamist-dominated 100-member constitutional assembly were partly disturbing in a nightly 15-hour par force ride.
As in previous constitutions, it is in the draft that the case-law was based on the “Principles of Islamic Law”
But what does it mean to “Psalms”?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the floating formulation and the legal space that is associated with it for a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This suggests at least a new article: In all the affairs of Sharia, Al-Ashar University had to be moved, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great radiation throughout Sunni Islam.
That doesn’t have to, but it can mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which would have resulted in de facto removal of the juridical.
A lot of things in the draft paper is an interpretation matter
It is also problematic: civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to suppress oppositionals.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state is also in charge, so it is designed to protect the true essence of the Egyptian family, and to promote their morals and values.
This is legally so unfairly formulated that state institutions with the help of this article could even control the content of film art and literature.
In the clear text, this means nothing but censorship.
No article, by the way, explicitly sets out the equality of men and women.
For this, another forbids or slanders the prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is insulting and how it is supposed to be done remains unclear.
Likewise, dubios encourages the formulation that “infliction of people” is prohibited.
Is there a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Explaining matters, as is so much in the draft, that Mursi is there for signature, and according to his words, \"very soon\" the Egyptians will be presented to the people's agreement.
“The revolution has come back.
The opposition has been formed for weeks against the overpower of Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual entry on Friday evening at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring the Charter down before it could enter into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed president of the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and ex-chief of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei explained that the constitutional draft belonged to the \"Müllberg of History\"
Through short news service Twitter, he accused Mursis of wanting to lead a \"push against democracy\".
“When he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and crash him,” said the oppositional Jasser Said.
“We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been poured out,” the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced not to want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid.
\"The Qur'an is our constitution.
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, was for the area demonstration, but not at Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer before Cairo University.
Many women and followers of the Salafists took part and cried out: “The people are demanding the application of God’s law.”
They called on Mursi: “Clean the land, and worship: “The Qur’an is our constitution”
A battle for the highness over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything took its start, would probably have raised civil war-like states.
This was obviously not going to put Mursis supporters at risk.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the Constitution and the advocates had expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide on the ballot, in which direction the country will go.
A majority for the draft of Islamists is considered safe.
“The word human rights does not even occur.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which would actually have gone up to February, and should involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights attorney and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison under Mubarak or in court.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was flogged, convicted, imprisoned.
\"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution - he complains in conversation with the \"world on Sunday\"
Mursi's expansion of power to all three forces in the state made the lawyer resign.
These measures are eclatant violations of democratic rules of play and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the President sets them out to be de facto,” said Saeda.
But without civil society organizations, democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels left alone, even by the international community, which views the ideological direction struggle at the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
It could be revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns: “You’re giving a monster that you can’t control anymore.”
Rakfish from Norway: Is this the world's most bad fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe but all over the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have something to do with the local appetite for pretty bad fish?
A selection of mature cheese varieties is taken.
You place them in the middle of a bunch of dirty, moist sports clothes.
And they'll be there for a week.
For example, one has to imagine the squeaking smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s major delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Bahnnes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that simply doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfish is salt-stained trout, which is fermented into water for up to a year, depending on the way you like your fish.
When in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather becomes colder, Norwegians stream to a feast here in Bärnes dedicated to this one, now, really very beneficial speciality.
“You eat it raw and then wash it down with a glass of Aquavit,” says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but as a so-called ‘Rakfish-General’, the festival also celebrates.
People around us consume small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol to themselves.
“Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfish,” Havard says.
The spirit can push the smell.
I'm costing some chickens.
If you avoid bringing the racfish to the nose, it is not bad - like Sushi, who has a pretty long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling options yet and fish was drunk in autumn in airtight salt water vessels.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken out after long fermentation and, undoubtedly, consumed under the help of alcohol-damaged senses.
Even before a generation saw thousands of Norwegians searching for work forced themselves to leave their country and immigrate mainly to the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who had not been far richer than Norway for too long, immigrants flowed.
Rakfish is considered to be something important - as an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But in fact, everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich cost proudly 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t often create it into the world press, and most people don’t seem to interfere.
Here we still hate to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the “ incident of 22 July”
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, the growth of the world’s largest oil and gas industries has been the main concern for Norway’s wealth.
“But oil is not the only reason why it’s so good for us,” says Anna, our waitress, the round tablets distributed with mature rakefish and embodies the Nordic ideal with their long blond hair and stony blue eyes.
We are a - as you say - a caring people.
Your English is just like most people here makellos.
We are not very engrossed, we don’t like prairie.
Norway has been very careful with its oil wealth - much of industry earnings will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, all of them threw money around themselves, which they did not even possess, Norway kept its currency close.
“As long as we can ski in winter and walk in summer, we are happy,” Anna says.
“And of course eating Rakfish,” she adds with a laugh.
I stand in the snow and stand up for another dish - from Rakfisk I have enough.
That kind of an Elk-Burger is definitely something else.
But in the evening, the stint fish is on the menu again.
The hotel in which I log is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging smells - fish.
There is a live TV screening to a showmaster dressed in a fly, surrounded by counters with raccoon fish.
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.
“What do you have in the top of the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jurgen?”
“Here are our points, Havard.
You laugh and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict thinness of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start
While Mexico’s future president Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing for his appointment, Will Grant from the BBC analyzes the challenges he faces and the mixed feelings of his people.
At present, traffic in Mexico City is very bad.
Even on better days, this is an ever-hidden city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which shuts down several important traffic routes to the capital and provides chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disrupt pendlers on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new President Enrique Pena Nieto will be given the presidential bond and will take over the leadership of the nation.
It is a complex task.
Under the separating government Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been able to maintain itself economically, but the country is in the midst of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
“My government is committed to reducing violence,” explained Pena Nieto in the Oval Office, U.S. President Barack Obama.
I will suggest a new security strategy with which we can achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. President, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, extensive part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo, for example, you are happy to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto has built and which represent a great improvement over the broken, hollow streets that once existed here.
Places with its name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
“We expect real and lasting changes from him,” said Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as Congress Commander for the Pena Nietos Party, the PRI.
In particular, as far as security and economy are concerned, we hope for an interesting and real change that so urgently needs our country.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was dismissed by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party puts great expectations to Enrique Pena Nieto.
The allegations of opposition, the new president failed to give up matter, he refused.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, especially if he is someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The town is hidden under highway crossings and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
Early this year, the military was turned on to fight the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot of breakland near a large garbage depot, the bodies of dozens of murdered women were left alone in the last two years alone.
During the term of Governor Pena Nieto, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that surpassed even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and murder of innocent women.
The critics of Pena Nietos believe that he did not address the issue of women's murder at least during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the descended quarter, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana began suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her life-threatening partner.
“When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed,” Senora remembers Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the bodystar had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, from the wall a picture of Mariana looks down on us, and it is attached to a cross that carries a single word: justice.
But this one, the family, has so far been rejected.
The authorities treated me as if I were a brother-in-law, a troublefounder, a nurse.
They want you to simply accept your judgment and keep your mouth open.
“But that’s not possible if there were so many flaws and failures,” she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the Presidential Bind on Saturday, he takes a great responsibility as well.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been drawn into compassion over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term.
“I hope as president he is as he was as governor,” says the PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear it most.
The prosecutor claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about misdemeanor
The prosecutors objected to Bradley Manning's allegations that he had been abused in prison
The hearing deals with Mannings time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks to reject the charge due to harsh detention conditions
The freedom of the U.S. Army is accused of using thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the prosecutor tried to determine that the Army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the largest revelation of confidential information of American history - had failed several occasions to complain about the alleged ill-treatment in military custody.
In the case of a cross-examination Mannings during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that documents on weekly visits that prison officials had made during Manning's nine-month term in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the crucifixion, which was held in response to a request for a defense to reject the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh detention period - Manning had stated that he had been in prison considering slavery.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service period in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein continued with Manning the forms that had been filled out by officials after their meeting with Manning during his detention in the Quantico military prison, where he had been in custody from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had considered the treatment by his watch as “excellent” and the treatment by the institution overall as “very professional”.
The forms, so fine, contained no complaints about abuse, although the officials had questioned Manning directly for his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they had been dealing with them, but they had not been logged in.
“They wrote down (after discussing the concerns) “No problems,” and that didn’t necessarily mean I didn’t say anything at all,” Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the self-examination he had mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to step down his observation status to prevent injuries.
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status, which is a stage under the threat of suicide, to his and to the protection of others.
“I wanted to convince employees that it was good for me, and to get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday that he was arrested and transferred to Kuwait, where he was arrested for about two months before being transferred to Quantico Marine Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had committed suicide in Kuwait and was once unconscious because of the heat.
Do not know what has happened to him or to the outside world.
“My world was shrinking on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together,” Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in this cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell — at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours — and without a society.
Only a mattress, a ceiling, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses were allowed.
Manning said he tried to stay on the move, because it was forbidden to sleep or just lay down.
He had to sleep with light from the outside in his cell.
If he turned at night and could no longer watch his face, they woke him up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's attorney formally raised opposition to the treatment Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning for an indictment he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night and be naked at a morning count in front of guards and other prisoners.
Manning had said he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this count.
During the Friday interview, Manning stated that he had concluded from a command of his guard that he should have dropped the ceiling with which he could have covered himself, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday Manning had stated that he had been forced to sleep naked in the previous night, and he had previously tried to show an official that he was not at risk to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the covenant of his underpants or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take his arrest experiences into account and dramatically reduce his arrest, he should be sentenced to the military court during his trial, which is set for the beginning of next year.
The defense has stated that Manning will confess minor offenses for guilt, while other charges that are considered to be too extreme are to be fought.
The continuation of the hearing is set up for this weekend. A justification of the conditions of detention is expected by the prosecutor.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners stored among the highest security provisions in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the benevolence of the enemy, unlawful publication of confidential information on the Internet, the transfer of national defense information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he threatens a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the immigrants - they call them to memory difficult times, he says.
Navarrette is the view that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when counselling broke out in me.
Signs refer to two snakes: one for \"Mexicanos\" \"Mexicans\", another for \"Extranjeros\" \"for foreigners\"
I stood there for a few seconds, uncertain of what I should do.
I grew up in central California and was called \"Mexican\" all my life.
An ethnic shortcoming - just as my friends in Boston - or my friends in New York - call themselves Italians.
Later, I chose \"Mexican-American\"
But that was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for shorts or bounds.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I am not talking about the vocabulary of a native speaker, and my American accent is not going to go away either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the snake for extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all the topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is a reason that Mexicans remain in Mexico today with the same high probability instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block following the example of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war of Mexico against the drug carts, even though he did not mention details.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of review.
Most Americans probably never lost a single thought that the United States had invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country’s leadership under armed force to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
As soon as a U.S. government official has only mildest criticism of Mexico, there will be complaints, in the Mexican press and among the country's elites, about how Americans are suppressing the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma are on the path of war.
And yet Mexico’s biggest challenge lies in the truth in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about resentiments?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people live Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our lifetime, a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - did not get a chance in Mexico and moved north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may be living the American dream, attending good schools and receiving good jobs, we must never lose sight of that it is the American dream we live in - not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity may have disappeared, but what affects our loyalty is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership class do not like us.
This is based on mutuality.
They see us as a sign of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we would not now see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and immigrated legally to the United States as a child, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans there are tensions because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are — and Mexican Americans take this seriously.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling of belonging neither to one or to another country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational citizenship want to resume their connections to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues about how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Well.
That won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unjust distribution of income, the unscrupulous corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if it really is a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet willing to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico over the next half a century, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a role to play in how their family members were treated not even so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we’re more Mexican than I thought.
Old Fights, New Near East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected base for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to spark such hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual debt, countless buildings were laid in shelter and ash, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed — and for the first time, rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolitan Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these obstacles.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
However, there are reasons to assume that the deadly path situation could finally find its end.
A war that will neither be lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems to be anything but applied in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, this week's fighting has strengthened the heartbroken ones on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, is claimed to have pushed the Israelis back, even though its grouping itself had to record great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are pampered in one of the most desolatest and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet managed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas in the West Bank wins, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to their side.
Turkey, a resilient, regional power once considered Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken place for the Hamas Party — just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Judging Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamist half moon - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has power over Syria, where rebels could stand more and more Islamist pressure before the defeat of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, the most distant and important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel, has changed the balance of the region permanently.
Hosni Mubarak, the laizist despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot even be pushed out by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, have an opposite conclusion.
Militaryly, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, Iron Dome, has been able to protect itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In a diplomatic way, the United States has held its position unshakable, and many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest violence scales.
Israel has achieved well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide killings - not least thanks to the blocking facilities that have been carried into the West Bank and thus into the main part of a possible Palestinian state.
Netanyahu stands well. His Likud party joined Avigdor Lieberman with an even more combative group in front of the elections on 22 January.
Why, too, do these post-listed Palestinians also hate and leave them their own state?
If they had control of the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire missiles just like their opponents in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in chess and punish them, they should dare to lift the heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to get through, but the Arab spring could strike them through the bill.
Even if the Islamists who now sit in power in Egypt and in other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense system is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to maintain their economy.
The fact that President Mursi met with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign — and perhaps symbolizing the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking visible steps towards democracy, Palestinians will continue to rob themselves of their right to self-determination - a powder font that will unquestionably explode into the Israeli occupied areas one day, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The oppression has already undermined democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to reduce Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a touch from the outside
The correct answer is the one represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel departs for security purposes.
The hope - for the near future - is that the cease-fire will give outsiders more influence to carry out this solution.
Now, together with Turkey and Qatar, Egypt has to stop arms supplies in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, complemented by exchange of territory and a common Jerusalem.
Outstanding Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the upcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute his part to moving Israel to negotiations.
During his first term, he failed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away from the white house, it seems as if he were equally reluctant to participate.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a significant interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for uniform cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colors with neutral olive green cover, which are printed with dramatic images that show sick body parts and children who are sick by cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and images, Saturday is the only difference between the packs in the brand names printed in identical, small font.
Australia is introducing the world’s most strict rules for tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government wants to eliminate young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government of studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking with 26 will not start with 99% more likely to be able to do so.
“You can already see at children’s young age that they understand the message they’re trying to apply to tobacco companies with their brand image,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the smallest smoker quotas in the world and the changes will only slightly affect the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
This means that black market trading would be beneficial with the laws, leading to cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes.
“The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian falsifiers will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
On the other hand, others say that the laws have encouraged their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that demand for cigarettes etuis and silicone covers for cover of unbearable packaging has increased enormously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan tobacco companies failed at the Supreme Australian Court two months ago with their opposition to the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
This is a good business for us.
According to experts, the hook is in the popularity of social media with exactly the population to which the plan is directed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, prohibited them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most traders to stop putting cigarettes in stores.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Whoever markets tobacco and only has a small area left to apply for its products does not come around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a health-care researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in experience on brands written by “all-normal people.”
You have to ask yourself: Is this just a private person who finds so great a favor in Marlboro cigarettes that she even takes a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that rather than marketing, the industry is focused on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to combat the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unjust trade restrictions, although none of the countries operate greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has conducted talks with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings in 2001.
Meanwhile, these have been expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show up in spite of this.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
“You just take a chicken and put the box away,” says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box on which a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Honestly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade “King of the Pack” in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made filling its shelf difficult.
“I used to take an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four,” Yu says.
“The government should have simply banned cigarettes — then we would have said okay, that was, we’re close,” he added.
In a constantly electrified world, it's nice to be bored too.
This Thanksgiving I spent five hours at the airport, when our plane ran out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another pilot.
So I had enough time to make myself a few thoughts too boring.
I don't want to lie.
A half day at the airport waiting for a flight is quite nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts lead bored as something positive.
When it comes to them, it’s okay for us and our children to be bored occasionally.
As a result, the brain is forced to lose itself in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constantly staring at one or another screen, the benefits of long-term benefits will no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome the longing with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I'll come back to this once again.
Like many people, I’ve always assumed that bored is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of \"Boredom: A Lively History\" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not.
“At the very least, the boredom has a very long history,” he says.
The house walls of Pompeii are a Latin graffiti about long-suffering, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define long-term.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York, Ontario, Canada, says the problem is that boring has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that long-term experience can be defined as “the experience of wanting to exercise a satisfying activity but not to be able to do so.”
As a result, apathy is long different from the fact that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In the case of apathy, however, there is no need to do something.
The key experience of long-suffering, he says, is in a “disruption of the process of attention, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that time is just slowing down.”
This can be long-lasting as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two states may be related, people see the problem in their environment or world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe ourselves to be boring, even if we just have trouble focusing.
In her study “The Unengated Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” in German, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues refer to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a band on which a person pre-reads a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring area that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was hardly visible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the hardly-hearing television said they felt more bored than the two other groups - they had problems focusing, could not find any reason for this and wrote their problems of boredom.
If you are trying to focus on a difficult or challenging task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you perform a one-toning activity - “like looking for faulty products on a factory conveyor band, music can distract and help you not feel bored”
In fact, he says, we now know that hemmings and criticisms, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even combat them by keeping people physically more attentive.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to chat around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit down,” says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a drowsy speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people are more bored than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a \"Self-Responsibility Foundation\"
On the scale, statements like “Many things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have enough time for everything.”
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to be boring than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - in particular, with regard to the need for more and a greater variety of external travel.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor of Human and Family Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adults in school and homework were bored, whereas 23% indicated they would be bored if they were not in school.
Only 3% of parents felt bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn’t know if the percentages have risen or fallen over the long term.
However, he is sure that “youth is considered to be particularly boring” mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their everyday life.
Back to my question of origin: is long-term health?
Sometimes it doesn’t because in extreme cases it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to alleviate them — that’s what studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers are investigating the relationship between long-term and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
“With the long term, the brain wants to tell one that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do best.
If one is bored and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you will be happy.
However, television can cause feelings of happiness in the short term, but these aliens are again in the long run.
If, therefore, he is able to get an iPad from his bored child, it can take him long-term, but it has not learned to maintain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he added, “self-control transfers from one situation to another.”
The child not only learns to talk, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate long term.
We should also not see them too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable with ourselves apart from the constant activity and technology reporting.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“It sounds as if we had to be more boring, but longing is the bitter, incessant desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
He believes that people in truth are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
“In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with when the noise is once silent,” he said.
In Colorado, there is no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands for a trial in the south-east of Colorado, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of some fewer marijuana brokers and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day by car in Lamar near the Kansas border when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was charged for possession of drugs and drug utensils — cavalry crimes each with a $100 penalty — and received a court term.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is he one too?
In the unfamiliar weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for its own use, the response to hundreds of minor drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of order contradictions surrounding marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities will no longer pursue adults over 21 years of age for small-scale possession, which will be permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next few weeks.
But state lawyers in Colorado’s more conservative districts have announced that existing marijuana crimes have continued to be pursued and are still citing people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“This situation is developing so quickly that I don’t know what’s going to happen next,” says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
And also regulatory authorities in the state of Washington scratched their heads unscathed.
They wait for an orientation aid to establish a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is thought that Colorado is in any case pre-emptive to most states regarding the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then for own use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well suited for orientation,” says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we can follow,” he added.
The Washington Act, called I-502, will enter into force on December 6 and thus form the endpoint of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not exist, but the possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time - for example, how the state requirement of “adjusted access” to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the ban on cannabis shops around 300 meters by schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle Balling Area,” says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent his employees to Aurora an e-mail stating that the prosecutor would no longer pursue minor marijuana offences in persons over 21 years, and that the police will seek no criminal notice of such offences.
Chief Oates added that police will continue to enforce urban regulations governing farmers of medical marijuana and would continue to pursue drug dealers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, district prosecutor Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After voting, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana ownership, mainly to move consumers to withdrawal.
At present, 119 people have to be accountable for possession of about 50 grams or less marijuana in court, although many have also been charged with other offences.
“Our authority has the duty to pursue violations of crimes, which were committed at the time of crime,” Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even in places such as rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, are no longer showing adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to allow all outstanding ownership procedures to fall.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time to enforce the right until it changes,” he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was already clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the conflicting reactions across the state, among local officials, promoted a deep-seated twist with regard to the great green experiment.
District prosecutors are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who is representing marijuana crimes in court and is acting on site as a spokesman for the national organization for reforming marijuana laws.
“They have spent such a large part of their lives pursuing people criminally, that they still cannot accept legalization,” he says.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national examples for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and government officials are preparing for an age of legal sales, at the same time, they are also nervous about the federal government’s instructions that will continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at federal level as a crime.
Advocates of the Legalization Movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will comply.
In spite of several up-to-date arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Obama government drug policy adviser, believes that criminals are likely to not enter doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, but are likely to be strangled, which, under the new legislation, are to tolerate government regulated marijuana business.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipal administrations approved moratories for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided on a six-month ban that is likely to be approved next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we license someone and then stand at the federal level before a big problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this change in law.
We focus on what the community has decided and not on what the state has decided.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mowed from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students of today are being attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended that university, which I once thought was the largest knowledge stamp in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had been planning to study history - I had packed my suitcases again and thus led the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was called I would have gone because I had a problem with having comedians in the neighboring room having sex.
Author A N Wilson stated shelmanically that I would have left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
The truth, however, was less enjoyable.
I walked away.
Yes, I'm running because I'm suffering systematic mobking and threats.
Not because of my very unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
It was only for one reason that I had been scheming - a reason that in this alleged wave of enlightenment seemed so narrow and cruel: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important advisor Margaret Thatchers and I advocate the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Now, according to current reports, a new generation of students of moderate rights suffer similar persecution.
The organized and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded equal rights protection, benefiting gays, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College indicate that they are “often actively isolated, personally attacked, and declared undesirable” because of their political views.
They require a place on the same-sex committee of their college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was worsened by a recently broadcast documentary about political students on BBC Two, “Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right,” which tories represented as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
This was shown, among other things, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the University of Oxford Conservative Student Association, who rode in a Rolls-Royce and protested with silver-colored suit and silver-occupied walking stock.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered “sin-bokes for the introduction of higher study fees.”
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: “There is a growing link trend in universities.
People believe we are like the Bullingdon Club, without getting to know us at all.
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the seek for greater protection, is the view that such a climate is “unsatisfied” The 19-year-old Stephanie Cheril, the president of Oxford’s Conservative Student Association, says that she has witnessed a growing rejection of students of reasonable rights among JCR members.
“This presents a danger to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members,” she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I was part of such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred for the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university voted not to award an honorary degree to Margaret Thatcher, a former student, due to shortfalls in higher education.
The atmosphere would have caused Stalinists to fear.
In the first few days of the first semester week, when new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the ridicule of Tory students, but even participating with joy.
Political issues such as the mining strike, the privateization and the government’s rejection of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wooden spaces of the tutor.
At my first of these events, I had to translate French texts from the 18th century into English.
“Miss Wyatt,” said the tutor Harry Pitt, “translate the first paragraph.
I stooped at it.
Pitt was a small man with a face like cake dough, and quite ugly.
“If thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or if they’re just stupid,” he asked me.
The other students kicked.
In my eyes tears walled up.
“I suggest that they take a few French hours in your leisure, so if you’re not too busy with your social activities, Pitt called me.
I returned to my room with hanging head.
That evening I was sitting in college alone at dinner when someone tipped me slightly on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year called James, who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's what it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory will be forced.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it's going to be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to change.
I insisted that I was not in all points with Mrs. Thatcher an opinion.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A professor of philosophy, politics and economics, who had ironically attended the Eton College as a conservative, said to me: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.”
You're dirty.
Other students shared their opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
“How have Tories sex,” one asked.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded ones only after the darkness breaks?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me, my mind’s eye extended to a fégeféfé of attention and isolation.
The only tutor who openly became known as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history who had his seat in my college.
He was not only hated to be a conservative, but also because he had counseled thatcher about foreign policy and had written speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincially and smallly, and rejected it for its Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed infidel.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said.
They would never do anything like this, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my Communist friends always put in perfect manners.
His wet eyes were trying.
Give the whole a chance.
I'm sure you're just fucking you.
It would break my heart if you went.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, including Tory supporters, had given up the pressure and denied his beliefs.
During a tutor the following week, where another history tutor seriously claimed that I was “an enemy of the people” I decided to do the same.
Although I had secretly broken up before shame, I admitted that my parents had been subject to a “cure wash” and called her “old hat”
The relief lasted only a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the sarg of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns each week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes, my fences gave up.
When they went, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You are happy to call me a winery slump.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such horror and evil in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Minister, but has hidden behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
‘Valentino prefers elegance of fame’
On the occasion of the exhibition 'Valentino - Master of Couture - which was opened in London this week, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian fashion maker customers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, which is worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognized by the designer at the opening of ‘Valentino’ Masters of Couture, a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 cloths of the Haute Couture have been assembled, created by his “Maison” in the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is “il signore” Garavani, but who could not have been written without his distinguished client.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the stuck and distant world of nobles.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be seen until 3 March, there are a wide range of private letters and photos with the signature of the most learned aristocrat, starting from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, through Princess Marie-Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophy of his social rise from the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobles does not have to be a disadvantage.
“At least they don’t put their chickens on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do,” says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
“We are all pleased when we were invited to his home in Gstaad,” explains the ex-wife of “Heini” Thyssen, close to forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music, one recognized and felt his influence.
“All invited people felt important and loved, remember the ‘Top Model’ that started their career in Paris during the week of Haute Couture 1995.
“He never comes out of fashion because his designs are artworks,” she says.
Modenschau der Origins
Garavani’s life is not a story of contentment, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-foot-long walkway, which suggests an exchange of roles: the user takes the role of the model and goes along the trail to admire a dreamy ‘audience’, wearing Valentino’s masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in La Notte, or a coat of wool and leather belonging to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names reflect that of Sibilla de Luxembo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Fashion Maker, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like the first love, “unforgettable”
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a western type “Gillette” and a jacket from the autumn/Winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s museums.
“I prefer him to all others because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty,” adds Feria’s ex-Herzogin.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The ratios are perfect.
The Princess and Opinion Leader at the Fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses.
Finally, in the late 1990s, it came to the end.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my vet, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a draped upper part with a decolleté that honors his name.
“It was a real dream,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino does not depend on fashion, its consciousness is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat living between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg preserves her fashion maker's evening dress - with absolute care - because a dress is not only a dress, but also the associated memories -
The 'King' of Fashion
The large finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 ragazze (as the fashion maker called his neighbors) were necessary to make this eleven-legged silk dress with pearls, twelve different stickers and a four-and-a-half-foot-long swab.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the chief authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, “the return to the customers of the top society.”
For years with the ‘savoir-être’ of the elite, Valentino is now her best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the honorary Legion, culminates in Garavani as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
“I’ve always noticed his refinement, his calmness, his well-kept and perfect expression,” D’Arenberg admits.
I saw him the last time a month ago at a Gala evening dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
\"He was madeellos; the time left no trace of him.\"
And this says a princess...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano play their lives and their health if they carry 70 kilos of sulfur across the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by taking sulfur from the Vulcan Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulfur-containing gas flowing out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them into two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the pulsating paths of stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carrier needs more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, while maintaining balance and taking care of its steps so that they do not slip and crash.
You know that every step can cost your life, as it happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on Kawah Ijen’s tails.
Kawah Ijen's mining workers earn 5 Eurocents for every kilo of sulfur they pay off.
Upon arrival, they walk the road between the tourists they photograph like Circussaffes and run with the tiringly heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has set up a little further down at a height of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been using its workers since 1960 to pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for every kilo of sulfur.
It then sells 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used for the production of stringed wood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamites and even for the making of sugar.
“Since we normally carry 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) each way,” explains Anto, who usually makes three routes a day.
For each route, it takes three hours, after which it is fully managed, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a miserable wage for such a sheer inhuman effort, but is the triple of what he would earn with field work.
“The daily wage of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees are paid (1.2 euros) a day at the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros) is very high,” explains the carrier who previously worked as a Maurer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not as hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, and that for a reason as important as the sulfur in Indonesia: “I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I took them to Java to convert them to Islam.”
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing often and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been playing his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left the first traces in him, though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs often and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
“I’m going to work here for two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent but life-punished young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands up every morning at two o’clock because the sulfur flows out at night, where his characteristic yellow color shines blue in the darkness.
The shadow challenging, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlight on his helmet, which he has bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets on the crater floor with sulfur on their shoulders.
Despite their large profits, the mining company has not mechanized the sulfur mining to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers working on their own account and being paid by weight.
They also do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 Euros) per photo device, which the guards of this natural park, along with the entry fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 Euros) of tourists who come to photograph the volcano and human carrier.
\"This work is for the animals and not for the human beings - Madrusin, a stupid, 42-year-old carrier who has been working for three decades since leaving school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue \"as long as it goes\" because he needs the money for the education of his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes are juicy when the wind suddenly turns and the mine workers climb into the thick columns rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course, except for the usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and blows on the shoulders that have been deformed by the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on its back, Unainik is able to carry 50 kg with his 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks via a goat path between the bush to the camp in Tamansari at 18 kilometers away.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano was my whole life,” Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest also works as a sulfur carrier with his 30 years of age.
Time goes by, but poverty keeps generation on generation in one of the hardest occupations in the world: the one who works as a human burden on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame them for not having children, for the career, stress and costs of real estate and child education.
“The population of Singapore has to grow.
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we fulfill our patriotism and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbons, but yet - or just for that reason - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local proverbs such as \"Shieben will be a \"bao\" (laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which has filmed the video, maintains the hope that the advertising spot achieves in a funny way to pay attention to the problem.
Her creative leader, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to help people fulfill their “national duty.”
This is just something for the internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the world’s worst, so we noticed that it was a topic we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfumes with pheromones or the organisation of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
Perhaps that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we do something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as compose a rap?
1,2 children
Anyone who does not take this issue easy is the government of Singapore.
Each year, she spends $1,300 for political action to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends the motherhood holiday and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2, which is also known as a replacement rate, was in 1976.
So why do the Singaporeans no longer have children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director for Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to a “better education and greater career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to marry and form a family significantly more options with regard to life goals and to set priorities,” she explains.
These changes in social circumstances have contributed to the higher number of single persons and to the delay of marriage and birth, the result of which is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, a immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counter the reduction of the population led to resentments in the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the hardly cashed xenophoby is flourishing against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping the wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also considered one of the reasons that the government party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and loans for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policy, Singapore’s example also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are being built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments that are known as \"shocks\" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a residential area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is the concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they deter the construction companies from building large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its “shock shafts” can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This makes them much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give the developers more clear orientations that were previously put in jeopardy if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with the Singaporeans working in the financial district are to be taken to the conclusion that they will not have a major effect.
“People are heavily stressed, housing and education are expensive, which is why it’s pushed out by many,” says a young manager.
Children can get others.
“It’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women lead their careers, stress and cost of property and education as reasons for not having children.
That is why the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children - there is still so much the government can do.
The offline private offline is private online
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the property of private or private life, where you have the right to protection from any type of interference,
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he makes known on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five teenagers between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the net.
In four of these cases, they linked the term to “something very unique” on a personal level and “to the password and the user” when applying it to social networks.
“My deepest secrets would not be revealed in a post,” says the 10-year-old Jorge in trying to explain the meaning of “private” in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world,” he confirmed.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that’s not mine, or someone who makes the stupid head,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos of nakedness, of crime, or to write abusive or violent comments.
Jorge assures us to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are related.
This includes the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up with Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if anyone answers to me, I just upload them,” he added.
“The social networks are entertaining, I can talk to relatives at a distance or to friends quickly,” he says.
Asked, he answers that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone recommended to him a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits that he does not know 20 of the people he has attached to his friend list.
“That doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, for example music,” he says.
According to the boy, no one made any indications to him or asked him for his address or phone number.
“If someone insults me or demands it from me, I just remove it from my user account,” he admits.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is not familiar with experiences known today as cyberbullying.
A friend’s acquaintance was pressed into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was, he assured.
According to José, the victim has not closed the user account.
“He made it private,” he said.
After that, he explains a series of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do that if he is insensitive to me or if I want to wipe him out.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he said.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a university degree in education and learning, says that in order to direct children and adolescents, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
“The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information; however, with the appearance of these pages, the rules of play have changed,” she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, the owner of a master’s degree in education at Yale University and author of the work — Digital Natives and Immigrants — formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital Natives are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
“We’re the digital immigrants to teach them where we’re still learning ourselves,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, “because we demand them to have a defined criterion on what may be distributed, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient for it.”
“You should also be selective if it’s most important for them to be popular to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is is to ask them questions that make them think.
“To say they shouldn’t do it doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to post a photo of you, like that you’ve published by a friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And another question: Do all of us need to know what you are doing at any time?
Another point is to give them understanding that they must act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
“Someone outside the internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks,” he explains.
Monitor
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational advisor, commented that it is essential that parents carefully read the social networks' guidelines.
If they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
“For example, age, or what you may share or publish,” he explains.
According to Guardia, the children need to be reminded of the lesson: You should not speak to strangers.
Closing of the Unasur summit without the publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th summit meeting of the Presidents of the Union of South African Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the declaration of Lima, which was announced before and was to be theoretically signed by the seven rulings present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI Ordinarily Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellery initially announced that they would hand it over after the clause, but then explained that it would be published at some time on the website of the Peruvian government.
In the case of questions about the text, they stated that the content was submitted by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the picture of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message “private meeting, limited audio”.
The little information circulated among the journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the governments of Unasurable at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused some of the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media discomforts that required more information.
After that, the Presidential Office of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the “conclusion” of the summit meeting, but it was the Declaration of Humala and not the official document to conclude the summit meeting.
In last October, Peru was host of the III Summit South Africa - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite the press's explicit request, the so-called declaration of Lima, which had been announced before, was published as little.
On the official website of the ASPA you can be convinced that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities emphasized that the information systems would be available to journalists, but to a great extent limited access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment by the Court of Justice of The Hague which established a border conflict between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which begins on Monday in The Hague, in the process of introducing the Lima against Santiago to listen to the pleas of both sides.
“We will follow and carry out the judgment on the differences we are currently presenting to this international court,” Humala, along with his Chilean counter-examination, said.
\"Chile was, is, and continues to remain a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, makes agreements, and undermines the international courts,\" Piñera added, greeting Humala with a hand-print in front of the flagships of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would subject themselves to the IGH took place after Colombia had filed a complaint against the Bogotá Agreement, which agreed to submit to the rulings of this international court, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake.
At the summit, the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, were present.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 after its president Fernando Lugo's resignation, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The head of state left the final document, stating that 16 decisions were made and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were fixed over a total investment amount of $17 billion.
On the decisions made, he said that the countries of Unasur will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights.
He said measures would be driven to “enhance cooperation in the fight against uncertainty in the cities and against organized cross-country crimes, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act together and efficiently in the event of natural disasters.”
With the crisis in Europe, “the economic consolidation (in Latin America) may not accept triumphant trains, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our people a better future,” added Humala.
“We have decided to give a number of 31 emblematic projects the priority to improve spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and create new economic forms,” the Peruvian president said in a read-out statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvians lying on the cross-axes of its area from the coast to Brazil, and two of which would provide a better connection to Ecuador, although it did not provide further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its resumption in the Union of South American Nations, of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good relations was another aspect emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, before his participation in the regional meeting, said he was expecting a meeting on Saturday in Mexico with his opposite of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to deal respectfully with the maritime conflict after a judgment of the IGH questioned by Bogotá.
“Maybe I will meet with President Daniel Ortega on the morning (Saturday)” Santos said.
“We will check all of these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes conversations with Nicaragua necessary” he stressed.
“I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilised and respectful as possible,” Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the office of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit meeting, in advance, the Secretary of Defense of the Block met to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, in which dialogue and consensus should be strengthened with regard to the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional block.
South America must learn to integrate its citizens, says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with, in fact, South America can learn something from Europe.
Correa, who participated in the 6th summit meeting of the Presidents of the Union of South African Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, explained to the state television in Peru that Europeans — in the second world war and in other conflicts — have become virtually a father country.
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that drives the member states of Unasur.
“Achieving the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors seeking a return to the past,” he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the redesignation of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the requirement to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and to consider those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return, we always sign to the South American.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its seat in Washington and is funded by the United States,” he explained as a reference to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured him that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but his “deep democratic values and views on human rights.”
He added that at the time, there were \"founded assumptions that Assange would be delivered to a public health service and would not comply with his procedures.\"
He also criticized the Swedish justice who demanded him to undergo an interrogation in his area of state for an alleged sexual offence, while \"the Swedish court allowed this by means of a video conference which could have been carried out through the Embassy of Ecuador in London.\"
Correa explained that the risk was that Assange's health and mental state would be affected.
“Since he was in our message, I haven’t talked to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one,” said the head of state of Ecuador.
However, there is the danger that he will suffer physical and mental damage because he is trapped in a close room and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
“That would affect the health of every human being,” he added.
Correa stated that the solution to Assange’s asylum since the month of June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London was the granting of a free letter that allowed him to travel to Ecuador, and that this was lying in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe’s. He stressed that there were talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, we do not apply this word to this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is leading a series of procedures at various European agencies,” he said.
And if the United Kingdom grants this free letter tomorrow, I think this is done,
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange on Ecuador’s embassy in London or Skype, how it allowed the Swedish case-law and in other cases, the problem was done.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm herself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate — the mediocreness, the evil intent, and the lie that defiled the free expression of the opinion.
“The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for gain and extortion,” he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists, nor by the bankers or hegemonic and food-sustaining countries, and supposed that in re-election, he would deepen the revolution to continue the way in that right direction.
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism must remain “hard and not give any opportunism and no act as a legally-clothed coup — because, as a result, ‘the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed’.
The President of Ecuador also holds the wishes of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of the Hague, who favoured Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, for \"absolutely justified\"
At present, this judgment will not be implemented.
This is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
You need to be treated extensively so that you can overcome it and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the disputes over the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that “it is right for Latin America to call on international agencies when both countries are obliged to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard to do so.”
With regard to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to succeed in his third mandate, he stated that he sees this possibility “with much optimism and joy, though sometimes it is also very difficult.”
Correa assured that if he left the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never personally interested me, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfill this responsibility,” he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as president, after which I will withdraw from public life.
This also applies when we lose.
“That’s decided,” he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuela's Vice President, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had traveled there for a planned, routine treatment, and that would expect him to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
“It does not mean in any case a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez,” he commented.
The Ecuadorian head of state today took part in the 6th summit meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for a higher regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of a death due to AIDS is a late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: HIV positive.
“It was as if a bomb was slammed in,” he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to weaken without recognizing success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such commitment that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At the time, he avoided even the director of a clinic of the IMSS, “because it led to a bag of gas.”
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and who have already injured the virus and exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, “means the great success today that the survival of a patient who takes care of the treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same,” said the head of HCG’s HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was based on a respected scientific publication in April of this year.
The specialist in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008 the scientists concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system of individuals at the start of treatment, and that those greater chances that are not dry-dependent: up to 30 years at a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years at a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above steps mean that those who receive the diagnosis HIV positive at the age of 25 can, in this sense, “become seriously 75 years old, as long as it is under control,” said this expert.
In order to be able to properly arrange this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has significantly decreased in recent years (in Mexico the number of people who die of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (yearly report of ONUSIDA)), it is still correct that since the appearance of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco died in 2011 and by May of this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- So why are people still dying?
In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have had no medical problems. The problem is that people come in a very advanced state because they do not know their condition of infection, i.e. at very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: “Nine out of ten patients will come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence global mortality, more early diagnosiss are needed, which is why all the people in need of this must be offered massive detection tests.
This proposal was agreed by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estadal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also by patients such as Fabrizio, who performed his test at a private laboratory, and this for the only reason because it had made a friend of him who was already in the AIDS phase despite his young age and even had the kaposio sarcom (a cancer-like tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they will die, and want to hear nothing.
“If I have to die, I’d rather place three times,” I said.
The change was to improve, I eat well, drive sports and take the medications.
Today, his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
“I work, undertake a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person,” counts Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animated with his testimony those who fear today during the global AIDS day.
The earlier they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live as all people are responsible.
Its message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the store table
Between the health programs and the simple citizen there are large holes, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the issue of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the places to do so, “the distribution of condoms was actually increased; they were released individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who don’t have access to a condom,” he said.
Youths are at risk of new infections.
\"What you need is a widespread ridicule of social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system that young people do not want to delay, the correspondent assured you.
He suggested that this inefficient distribution be reoriented; the condoms should be not only behind the store table, but also in spending devices in public toilets of facilities often visited by adolescents.
It is not intended to promote promiscuity.
It should not be paid to them the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González answered the question of whether it would be distributed conservatively under his administration.
“Sexuality doesn’t look that way; it’s best to bring the condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity,” he said.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally seen in 4th place of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of infections occur via sex, 6% via blood, and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know for each registered case.
After the U.S. Court of Appeal has confirmed a ruling that does not recognise the restructure of the Liability of Vitro Group, which has been reached through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, a bad precedent will be created for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has payment problems.
It could therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of companies that allow Mexican laws do not apply in the country of the stars and stripes in opposition to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment received on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas leads to the fact that the Mexican companies are exposed to the seizure of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico door and gate to call the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistents.
While the judge points out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Fifth Circuit appeal court, based in New Orleans, first says that the main procedure is the trade bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for payment inability of companies with cross-country profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations model law was created for the unifying of international trade law, with the American Law Institute being used as a refuge.
Second, the ruling states that, without the votes of the societies in recognition of the obligations in the bankruptcy mass that the branches of Vitro had with their parent society, the required majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
In fact, vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose obligations among companies of the group have been confirmed by Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
It is also correct that after withdrawing the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained to the courts of the United States against Vitro, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is responsible for its difficult situation as of 2008 as part of the major economic crisis in the United States, which caused the country to strike.
For this reason, the González Sada family objected to the same court of appeal so that the vote would take place in the plenum, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this does not take place, the Cerciorare opposition, which calls for the review of the proceedings by a higher authority, is filed in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The most serious thing in this case is that the court left a document by the Government of Mexico sent under the FIGURA amicus curiae (friend of the Court), in which the procedure carried out by Vitro is described under the Act on Trade Concourses, and in which it is pointed out that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the Concourse Act of the United States.
It is also noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission for international trade, i.e. the established rules for the cases of cross-border payment inability which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambole: a hit for vitro and for the country.
General balance
After the ads by the Mexican air traffic unions against former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, did not come forward for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Avidores (co-operation of the pilots).
The request by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Investment Commission, which is being accused of disability to justice.
After that, the Supervisory Authority has systematically refused to inform the Republic's main administration of a transaction carried out by the Entrepreneur in order to depose the bank IXE's trustee account F/589 on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used to acquire shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a meeting on the weekend at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, complementing a residential area for employees from 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the national chamber of the processing industry) has achieved to unite the governors in the south-east to oppose the monumental institution, which partially destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all the threats of the industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a Senate request to explain under what conditions and circumstances of the Mexican ambassadors in Japan did not comply with the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of intellectual property.
As you know, these measures took place, although the Senate had taken the opportunity out of consideration because it viewed them as a violation of the free expression of opinion in the social networks.
Homex long term

The corresponding investments amount to more than $1.5 billion.
Héctor - Hetin - Reyes: \"Basketball was my life -
The basketball world boomer, Héctor - Hetin - Reyes, has been connected to corbs for more than 60 years and has been preparing the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the history of the country’s basketball, like Héctor-Hetin-Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether it was a player of lower classes, players of the first national league, commander and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Association.
“My life I put up a lot of hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 90s, Reyes remembered visiting Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
Basketball was my life.
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photographs and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that remember his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as players until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as a co-manager or manager of the club.
“These were my best years I enjoyed most because I was allowed to be part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as managing director, co-manager or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships in succession from 1971 to 1975.
And then I agreed with a 1981 championship, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on, \"Cuco - Ortiz, who was a very good administrator,\" says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartov, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: “I have a very strong and 2 m-tall player.
Do you want him?
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartov then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was a citizen and one of our best throwers.
I still know how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would have cared for another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already out of a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his performances and that of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won the pre-olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
After that, the 1990 World Championship, where we played the fourth place, came to what should have been bronze, if not this Canadian judge who had let us repeat the last game for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the 1990 World Championship the best national team you’ve ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
My favorite, however, is the team of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the U.S. team a fight, as at the time, when they won bronze against us at the World Championship.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculín (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) - Toñito - Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario-Quijote - Morales, who could not be there for a knee injury in 1990.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which prepared us great joy, was that of the 1995 pre-olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourrutiner as a replacement for the disabled players because of the events at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated the same level as Piculín.
And this, without considering his career in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you believe is the best thing you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN initially from the 90s to 17 teams in a season.
What are you going to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce only play in their area and only meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessary travel and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed trainings and courses for coaches, table officials and arbitrators.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, see videos of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as “J.R” in the television series “Dallas” where he played an unscrupulous, prideful and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series \"Dallas\" became a symbol of the 80's's.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of \"Dallas\", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release at The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of \"Dallas\"
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he again played the iconic role that pleased him the most,” the family said.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the feast of thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was at Hagman when he died in Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He made all the joys that knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, witty, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an original person and lived life in full motion,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he drank a lot over years.
In 1995, a malicious tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent transplantation.
In the years before \"Dallas\" Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in 1965-70 with the sitcom \"Sitcom\" enchanting Jeannie - the NBC television facility.
There, he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on the head when he meets an attractive “shin” (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He was also a performer of two comedies, which were broadcast only a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and “Here We Go Again” (ABC, 1973).
His cinema work included the critical roles in ‘The Group’ — Harry and Tonto’ and ‘Primary Colors’
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly reprehensible J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the television chain CBS over the Ewing clan and other figures in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising statement “Who shot J.R.” that should create expectation for an episode full of emotions, where Hagmann’s figure was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were spent in betting.
This made the series reach a viewer record at that time.
When the answer was announced in a November 1990 chapter, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who had turned “Dallas” into the second most viewed entertainment program since the end of “MASH” in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the brother-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot.
J.R. had slowed her down and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, unsatisfied man with a charismatic smile: a late businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcohol-sick wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
“I know what to stand on J.R.’s gravestone,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called \"Here rests the worthy citizen J.R. Ewing\"
This is the only business he has not won.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, reminded Hagman of Hagman on Friday as a “normal personality on and outside the screen”
He is unforgettable and unforgettable for millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts those who were lucky to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of “Dallas” were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second staff was completed, and a sixth chapter was just filmed, the transmitter informed.
From Warner or TNT, there was no immediate explanation as to how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as \"South Pacific\" and \"Peter Pan\".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatre stage in New York City in the early 50s, after which he served in the Air Forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs \"Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life\"
“I didn’t write anything that I believed could harm someone or affect him in any way,” said the Associated Press of his time.
After the liver transplant, he volunteered for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist frightened patients.
“I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are ahead and then,” he said in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as “no fear, it’s a bit uncomfortable the first time, but it’ll go well”
He also opposed smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Start of the course that studies the “end of the world”
Every week, students investigate apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Each semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible angel hook: the end of the “long backward count” of the Maya calendar on December 21, of which many people believed it to be the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect of him in the following two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, some called “Deudarmaggedon”, and a growing conflict among Israel’s participation, the place of which the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
“I haven’t noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” Charmé told the students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey) this week.
If someone analyzes what is happening in the world today, as if we were thirty days away, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the deficit is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor to offer courses about the “end of the world” this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, assistant Professor Barry Vacker gives the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World”
Every week, students investigate apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
“We are analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, as well as the way mortgage scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
When nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could compare themselves to real life.
“I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
At the University of Pennsylvania’s main campus, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course with the simple term “The End of the World”.
“We don’t take up 2012 so we always keep the option of being able to hold the course again, in case the world doesn’t go under,” Restall said.
Despite the “pre-existing decline,” students need to study, create projects, and participate in final exams.
In Penn State, the final examination will be carried out on the eve of the apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance than “to continue working until the night where the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
“In two hours there were no more places,” Restall said about his course for high average students, who filled with 35 students.
Weeks before semester start, we received emails from students who asked if there were still places to be free.
The students, on their part, assure that the course is one of the experts.
“It’s fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
Apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually just a question of comfort or its lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for Psychology and Health Care explains that he has seen all apocalyptic films.
“I haven’t heard anything from a class where this is taught,” he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed — and less a professor — declared to believe in the last date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with Maya’s prophecy, and we discredited it in a certain way,” Julie Zeelen, a student last year in Temple, aged 21, and from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, Rest said.
However, he notes that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that leads back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
“In other places, people don’t think that way,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course there about the end of the world.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken of by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, “people immediately think of a new date” or that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period, which would come to the end of the world.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said they wanted to celebrate “the end of the world.”
“Perhaps I’m calling a few friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
