The goods cost under 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of goods....
I'm #PRS_ORG# grandchild and so it's not a problem for me.
Only need a number or instruction what I should add to the package so that it can be drawn by you as a return.
I ordered #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs €179.
I honestly think that is very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and order again for the better price or do there be another possibility of the credit?
I also believe that children should not be allowed to take on a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it’s also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones.
Check out a short time, help a little, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children, I see no problem there.
If your K1 is working alone for the short time and it’s OK for it, that’s good.
You can determine for yourself whether this is appropriate for your children.
It is not so that he should develop K2 and accompany it for hours while sleeping.
It is likely to be questionable on a purely legal basis.
Perhaps that’s why the psychologist’s statement comes.
If something should actually happen like a fire, collapse, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to enter is of course your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire action but I don't want the title partout to fall down again, maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, an animal careman commits suicide by squeezing himself with feed and going to his predators.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short examination, is on his therapeutic device that operates a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (for fire) and lands with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is assigned anonymously to go and document the photos on the Internet before each suicide.
In any case, it eventually turns out that this therapist operates a type of underground therapy group where the patient is planted a chip that suppresses a center of fear in the brain and ultimately puts the patients in the most extreme of their fears.
(A woman jumps out of the window another rides to death with intent)
This fear is referred to in the book as “the fight”.
In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the rough act I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author/author.
If this action is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
I don't have the password available for Wlan.
First, I need to contact my husband.
But it can take a long time.
What steps should I take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Child, 4 j., splitter under the thumb nail
Child, four years old, has wood splitter under the thumb nail over the entire length (outside).
I tried to pull him with a pinset.
Very hard to handle.
It didn't work and hurt.
Now the child responds hysterically when we try it.
No more chance.
Tomorrow it's going to be a doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module on a circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost every loop width H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all the most common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm large-scale sugar-surprising speaker next to sound capsule set.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multi-protolog decoder.
It controls the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are, of course, 2 and 4 digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoder is fully automated on a suitable digital center.
It controls all DCC programming modes and, thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out at appropriate centers.
For centrals that can only program the CVs of 1-255, there is an aid register.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola® addresses allow the release of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also enables a re-programmer with the honest control unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration to mfx® compatible centers.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® brake lines as well as Zimo® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
The brake with DCC brake components or with equal voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also holds on to a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC shuttle engine allows automatic commuting between two railway stations.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to advance refresh vaccination
New Omicron funds are always concerned with politics and science in the UK.
By New Year, all qualified adults in England are to receive a vaccine offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to advance even faster with the corona refreshment vaccinations due to rapid increase in Omicron numbers than has so far been sought.
Every adult in England has been given the opportunity to receive a booster dose until the end of the year, unless at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
So far, the target date has been at the end of January.
The British government will also provide support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the countries of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
One faces an emergency in the face of the Omicron variant, which is why the vaccine protection needs to be reinforced, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
“Let yourself be angry,” Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 additional Omicron balls were registered in the UK, increasing the total number to 3137.
In comparison to the previous day, that was an increase by 65 percent. dpa
Is the full amount refunded from the purchase price upon receipt?
I'm going to have everyone present themselves with vocabulary.
I sent an application.
Today, the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not a \"Peter\" but a slightly more complicated name.
I've gagged him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I don't know how to write the e-mail now.
Can anyone help me?
** I am a foreigner and do not want to stop officials from walking.
Conclusion: Everyone should imagine themselves with vocabulary.
It has a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them.
Only the one I bought today is not going to
Obviously, the chair had an undisclosed lack of sales.
How can such a Polster damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Only on the #PRS_ORG# tried.
That has been working for a long time.
No more 14 days.
That’s why I’ve always bought the last books about the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted 8 buy.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me that.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content warning: I will write something detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about the soul.
For professional reasons, I come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often.
A topic that really nudges me and, unfortunately, is far too often that many victims can’t help themselves or think we could not help them.
It is clear to me that we can’t do everything and it’s not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in the conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing, I cannot reach all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's afraid to leave fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear that the children will escape from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is partly close to the tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to take violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it will never be easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so unsurprisingly important.

Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel der MHP Ries Ludwigsburg bei den Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster John Patrick was abandoned.
Again, for the second time in not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with a look back at the Pokal defeat in early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: \"We still have something anger in the belly -
This has not been laid down after the game, but once again increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Federal League.
More than the naked result, the way of the appearance was disappointed.
The three-quote was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young John Patrick) in saying and writing 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer John Patrick gave: “We were simply not focused enough after the victory at Tenerife, and did not realize what we were training.”
Just move the ball.
On the other hand, his opposite, Sebastian Gleim, responded: “To win a horny game for the second time against Ludwigsburg,” said the happy coach.
“It felt like a thousand people in the past,” he said.
Only 750 visitors were allowed on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their expense.
Not least also because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and directed the game of his team.
“The best gamemaker I’ve ever trained, Gleim still praised.
While in Patrick's team themselves, the performance carriers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed throughout the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle from reaching up to eight points after they had already left 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon came to 12 points.
Fortunately, a lot of time for gardening does not remain.
Already on Wednesday (19 a.m.), the giants received the Skyliners Frankfurt, and before then in Ludwigsburg, a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different address, but I changed it.
Yes, I've been reporting to myself a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all assurance claims were rejected.
We have been legally informed and have written them again.

Pulverize as from the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of hitters from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the go with the program “Good Day, Love Happiness” if he is allowed to appear.
In fact, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But there's nothing out there.
The planned concert was laid out in May 2022 - \"on official instructions - to inhibit the corona virus.
Other of his performances planned during the Advent period must only happen once, as it is mentioned on the website of the singer, who is now 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
As of January, the artists will then want to repeat their dates already moved in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian Lünen, Max Raabe has already sang a lot and enjoys it as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with commitons.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire from beaters and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonist.
He was often awarded prizes.
His live album from the “MTV Unplugged” series (2019) reached the second place of the charts — just like his success album — for women is not a problem (2013).
He managed it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blond hair is strictly coming back and looking at labels, Max Raabe is no longer to think away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the programme “Good Day, Love Happiness” he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Bundesbauministerin Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by expropriation
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has expressed his opposition to the dispensation of large housing companies, as has been required in Berlin in a popular decision.
“With a dismantling, there is no new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure,” Geywitz said in an interview with the “days mirror” (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
A bunter mix of, for example, private tenants, cooperatives or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition from SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to use an expert commission on how to deal with the result of the decision.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz does not conclude conversations with the FDP in the Ampel Coalition about further reinforcements in rent law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake by 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of rent levels.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement it as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, “we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps” emphasised the SPD politician.

At least 100 dead by tornadoes in Kentucky
In the case of a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been pulled by the United States.
Only in Kentucky could be more than 100 dead.
The pictures from there remind us of a war area.
During the night on Saturday, several tornadoes in the United States have caused severe destruction and may require up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave an approximately 320-mile-long snout of desolation, especially in the Member State of Kentucky.
That governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was scattered, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He alone calculates in the state of Kentucky with up to a hundred dead, the official figures rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that she sold out Vitrine #name#.
That's very harmful.
Is she still being produced?
Or was it taken out of the range?
Is there any way to order this vitamin in another country?
Until when do you sign up?
If the delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand, only can I order the ceiling now and deliver it to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an Artike via the contact form and had given up an order and wanted to ask if it was coming in or processed, since I had not yet received an confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising spells
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
They are therefore on a line with the Economic Committee and the Economic Chamber, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans to vaccine calls - according to German example - is also intended to increase willingness to corona vaccinations.

It's a year ago.
He obviously didn’t stick to his old place, and he was looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: no matter what.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.

Help with your first campaign
Boron to the greeting!
I’m just leading a group of 4 friends to adventure over the gripping pass and want my heroes seamlessly to lead into a campaign written for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big arc is made, the bad weights and their motivations written, the individual act designed, and now I am writing the entry adventure and already stumble at the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a vehicle with grain from Gratenfels into a small village near the Thuran Sea.
This is where the further action is to be developed.
Some miles away from the village, the heroes are supposed to clear up a group of goblins and lure them into a backyard.
I would like to give players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: conviction, action, threat, the danger early on, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and saws armed
In the case of non-notice, the Goblins lay up the heroes in a hollow road and flick to each three left and right bows the vehicle, while two with spears stop the drive.
If it comes to battle and the heroes are subject to it, I have two solutions
The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village school, a half.
Of course, the car is gone.
If a defeat is infallible, this half-seven will enter with two of his servants and will come to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The car is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate is Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The Goblins group will play a crucial role later on, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narrative.
I built the lamp again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send them back anyway.
Then you can let the back lights come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm nervous about Sky Sport F1
Hello, F1 fans, over the season, the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to make a little air with this post.
At first, in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was cancelled in order to start the F1 preliminary reporting on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the start of the schedule was far behind planning, you could still have shown the last (planted) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, the F1 takes priority and must therefore restrict everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Even though stupid, Sky UK has transferred the race to the finish.
Despite a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has been well accompanied by the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident.
Then in the F1 there was regular ignorance with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that under a red flag, the tyres could be changed.
Although this situation existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that walks may change the tyres when there were corresponding radio statements on this subject to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for walking.
I think such elementary rules should be known simply if you comment on the F1 in a pay TV channel.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or required according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in terms of rules.
Generally, I don’t like Roos’ artful comment style, but let’s say that it’s the taste.
But I really like Heiko water from RTL better.
To this end, there are constant almonds, both of which are simply unprofessional, such as the ordering of coffee at the (almost unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or “UuuuHD” by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter, in particular, brings a lot of unrest into the comment that he apparently does not take this seriously.
Not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-out round, Sky is the only transmitter that goes into the advertisement as you can listen to F1TV as only the German sound track without comment must come out right after the race.
No ServusTV or ORF do that.
Also, these two stations make less advertising in training than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Although you must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not make me look beyond the disadvantages.
Sky Sport F1’s remaining program is also very expensive and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking transmitter to transfer the F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job in the four races they can still transfer.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On the one hand: #PRS_ORG# pendel light, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it's going to be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she'll check and send an email and she's never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already had a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole on the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Ventilator pumps are excellent for providing an aquarium in addition with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate whole plants with them.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps are suitable with 2 or more outputs so that you can connect to more outflowers.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump, but also offers to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (find us in the shop) or with a decor that turns the air blows into a function.
Here would be a treasure trophy, mussel or similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-damaged design and thus provides low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an ausstreamer etc....and already it can be started.
The fan pump should be equal, or higher than the water level and be mounted outside.
If the fan pump is located deeper than the water level, you should put a back-up valve in between.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent once water would run backward, running the water out of the basin through the pump...
Should the fan pump be fitted outdoors, you should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time with 3 days here in Ebay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are picked up every day.
Runs well on the way, it goes very fast.
We just want to avoid a little bit so that no one is in agreement, just because it has been a little longer.
It would be like, not everyone has understanding for the whole staff, who also work in speditionism... of course here does not stop Corona.
Please do not judge you equally badly, just because delivery is delayed, this is exclusively due to the package services.
Of course, we like to scramble about these services, even if we say at the moment,...they have it hard to do.
This is also regionally very different.
Be no one's evil, stay healthy and we all hope that there are better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellows with and without armrest?

Amazon founder Bezo sends astronauts daughter and Moderator to the world
The daughter of the first U.S. in all, a TV moderator and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system New Shepard, the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
Starting and landing the around ten minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under bright blue sky, Bezos took the newly shortened astronauts to the reception after their return.
“Welcome back,” Bezos said, dressed in a blue space suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on their way for 10 minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the Blue Origin missile system was named, and 50-year-old TV moder Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company that other four passengers had paid for their tickets: Space Engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, Technology Entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they each paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He worked hard at his efforts and had to do everything himself.
She was just flying in that way, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also excited.
He would like to return to the world again, the Moderator said.
“New Shepard” flies up to 100 kilometers in height
The rocket system - New Shepard - flies largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the earth, timed with difficulty, before the re-usable object brake off from large parachutes landed again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers across the earth as a boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was the third manned all-out from Blue Origin: the first one in July was Amazon founder Bezos himself on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutch.
On the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as \"Captain Kirk\" in \"Star Trek\", was also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.

Someone who has worked in biochemy or studied biochemy
I am currently studying in the first semester of biochemy and actually find the subject in itself quite exciting and also in the laboratory is not bothering me (have already the inorganic chemistry practice behind me).
Of course, I also thought about professional prospects before studying, but also about the time I wanted to study and become a doctor.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially overwhelmingly, about my career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you will hear super professional opportunities again and again and again, the profession has been completely sought out, on the other hand, you will always hear of unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That’s why I would really be interested:
1) What do you do right now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/maintenance?
3) What have you studied/What training have you done?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really insecure right now and maybe I'm considering ending the study in 2022 and making an education for a specialist informant.
If you have experience, you also like to write :)
Extra stress before holiday & holiday weekends
This issue came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why it's only now that there's a patch to it.
Not only are there major stress in our business, such as Christmas holidays.
As it seems, there are also those before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week, Marie was going to go to the sky, which is called \"on-going\" with us in Switzerland.
On Friday, the majority of people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what was going on last week?
Stress everywhere.
According to e-mails, which must be out before departure, order here, everything *uncondition* before the long weekend.
Because... yes, because?
Because “first week then” sounds after so much time and should not be?
Or because people want to make as much as in a normal in a short week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also excited.
What should this self-dealing be for holidays?
What do we still have holidays if we can’t get them right?!
The stress did not come from the top, the colleagues were all very self-sustaining.
My question is: Are we just like that, Swiss?
Is this our reformed evangelical nature?
Or do you know this in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but has no gifts yet.
“The beautiful thing, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, is simply to drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian forest,” said actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the feast by baking and basting with her son.
“I love it,” Catterfeld said.
But she still has a lot to do until the meaningful days: “For the first time, I don’t have any gifts yet, I have to finally leave.”
NECTON-Bio supports a smooth running of the mouse and the feeder reformation.
NECTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg of biotin/kg.
NECTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and bright feeder.
The majority of animal damage occurring in the bird's care is solely due to food failure.
Since the feeder consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein feeding of the bird is required for the formation of a flawless spring garment.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Much of the animal losses that occur during the mouse are based on inadequate or unbalanced protein supply and/or inadequate supply with vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NECTON-Bio, the adverse ratio of amino acids in most vegetable foods is explicitly considered and balanced.
During the use of NECTON-Bio no further vitamin should be administered.
NECTON-Bio is cold water-soluble and can easily be administered via the drinking water or by the soft food.
Thank you so much, I found it
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
DDR handicraft model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the Lok was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare Lok probably comes from the reconstruction proposal of the Model Iron Railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with game tracks and misdemeanors see photos, function well, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn Society (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, where possible the set also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTUTKE and BACHMANMANN.
A locomotive is located at DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we operate
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to present proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at 45 km/h.
As a maximum speed, 65 km/h were required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined on delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with a tactile bearing drive AEG with the supply of the mechanical part, the Siemens shock works with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives received the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All survived World War II and were then restored to the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahn improverungswerk Dessau, the workmanship of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As a result of the progressive reelectricisation of the medium-German network, an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service was developed in 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were worked on, with the other machines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 present in larger numbers were preferably constructed.
It was not until the E 94 that the work-up number could not be further increased that the E 95 moved into the focus of the work-up.
[4] At first, the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They came to the railway station Halle P in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own circulation plan before coal trains from the hostage valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
At increasing age, the complex control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
In this way it was more common for gunmen to stick during switching operations.
Then, on this locomotive, the beimann with Hammer and Holzkeil had to re-solve the gunman during the ride.
Damages to the motors occurred more often and resulted in months-long failures in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new building locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of the electric operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to abandon old locomotives and most split types, leaving the E 95 out of service.
In addition, they found that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only one more time, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the above-mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibilitys of the driver's position.
In mid-1969, E 95 02 and E 95 03 were replaced by E 95 01, which ended on 5 October 1970.
The new designation 255 001 has thus never been used.
Up to the E 95 02 all locomotives were destroyed.
The E 95 02 was established as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a soft heating facility at Halle Main Station.
It took some time for the representatives of the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worth a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external collaboration of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it to a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] She has since been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986 the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
At DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive museum is maintained.
Since 1995, employees of the tradition community Bw Halle P have been working on the operation of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external painting, with the transformers being checked and five driving engines capable of operation.
- The locomotives were in use on the Schlesian mountain track and the branching side paths until 1945, where they proved themselves on the basis of their reliable drive and the low maintenance effort.
In February 1945 the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the central German network.
The main area of use was first Silesia
Handiwork model H0 in OVP, function well, it's optical afterwork at the lok in own work necessary, dusted, with playing tracks, basement smell!!!, very rare handiwork model, very small edition possible also comes from the small series company ZSCHSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can have labels and storage tracks.
Yes, the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with some of them.
The center bar is held by two feet..guides are too narrow and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, these are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The center bar does not fit into the intended holder.
So I get new ones.
When will they be sent out?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
These are, according to the assembly manual, the right of the form, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing they do is meet their purpose.
They are not flat with me.
Could I get this sent?
Hello #name#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Home fire with two slight injuries and high damage
Two people were easily injured in a fire in a home in Oberbayern.
In addition, an estimated damage occurred in the six-digit euro area, as police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residence in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were hospitalized on Sunday with light smoke poisoning.
The exact fire cause was not known at first, but the police did not go out of a deliberate fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken the further investigation.
Then it comes a lot later.
And I have to pay for it again.
To Defeat Fake News - Biontech CEO Releases Impf Photo
Uğur Şahin published on the social network \"LinkedIn - a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021
Biontech chief Uğur Şahin had not so far publicly expressed himself to his vaccine status.
Now the entrepreneur released a photo showing his corona vaccination.
A friend’s illness moved him to tell ésahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccine against the coronavirus.
In the social media, there was false information that I was probably not infected.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine, wrote on Friday in a post on the network 'LinkedIn'.
“For a few months, friends have forced me to post a photo of myself on which I am being intimidated to counter those false rumors.
So far, he has rejected this because communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: “I was deeply upset when I learned that an old school friend is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a beater for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not intimidated, énahin continued to write.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
“The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and distrust.”
Fear can only be hard to deal with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the German wave in which Uğur Şahin says he was not intimidated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle himself explained.
“I’m not allowed to get the vaccine myself by law at the time,” énahin said.
There is a prioritization in Germany in the vaccination of vaczin.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been long suspended - and the Biontech chief has, according to appropriate information, been vaccined three times.
Fire in Revoltage: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a tensioning station.
After a fire with severe damage in a tensioning station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Vieng-Creis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to come out without electricity for about 24 hours.
By fire on Friday evening, 41,000 residents and residents in several municipalities were walking out the lights.
The supplier Westnett reported that numerous emergency power infrastructures were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely fixed late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers of THW supported the municipalities.
The authorities offered nursing places in schools and called for assistance from neighborhoods.
The provider thanked the concerned for their patience and their commitment to the helpers.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected communities, the county, the firearms and the THW for their tireless use,” said the head of the primary engineering sector, Florian Witt, in a meeting on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will continue to take a few days, as the West Network mounters could only use some lines in the first place, he said.
A technical defect, according to company data, led to the fire.
Power flows again
The fire that broke out on Friday at 19.15 a.m., according to Westnett, has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt scale system in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid Volt.
There is a need for expensive cleaning and repair work.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt-volt-level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 18 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Other 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been gradually switched on from 21.30 p.m.
Since 23.15 p.m., the latter also had the power affected by the failure.
Over 80 stores of West Network and partner companies have been in use.
After building an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance.
“It is important now that citizens take care of older or single people in their neighborhood and communicate to local firefighters when needed,” said the country council, Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In the creation and operation of emergency power infrastructures, the residents of Altenheimen were primarily focused.
In addition, temporary nursing facilities were set up in schools for those people who could not provide themselves or the power-dependent medical devices needed or for medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling has been sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it with you and pay it in Euro?
This is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy . . .
But I can't mount the bottom on the tableboard.
This is custom #name#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with tableboards diameter of #NUMBER#
We have 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can’t put it in one another and therefore shorten it.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise I would have to send them back because they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy for a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then we'll do it that way!
Do you send me the return card by email?
The repair is now complete.
I tried this before chatting.
Before buying, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost unashamed.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic combination: Kombinier Riiber wins
The German Nordische Kombiniers Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid were printed on the podest at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.

When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both remade s and use the version 4.5...
You may already have heard of problems.
Having directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book it seems to be on it as well.
As soon as I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be wrongly report it to the customer service.
As far as I can see it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work between them too!
In order for the color order to be uniform and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, wash with clear water and dry off.
Before bringing the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
This can be done on the later no longer visible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first strike on the component
Draw the brush evenly strike next to strike.
Light overlap of the color layers later provides a uniform surface area.
Avoid flashing fast back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealisticly effective areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark might appear later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to an end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can come to unsanitary metal slags when mixed with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you build them.
Original faithful appearance achieves the models by means of the decals or pull-off images.
From high signs on airplanes to ship names to drawbars and features in car models: the decals give the model the last slid.
Bring the decals in the right order, as long as the components are still to be reached well.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued more easily before it is built into the hull.
Even more important than the right tool such as shears, pinsets, and toothsticks are while staying time, patience, and a quiet hand.
Cut each required decal individually and put it right to you.
Decals are also called water slide images because you briefly moisten their back with water until the carrier paper gets dark through the noses.
Then you only move the picture from the paper a small piece and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, you remove the carrier paper laterally.
Attention: Always check whether the image is sitting right before you completely move it from the paper so that it doesn’t stick, cut, or even tear it on the finger.
Suction of excess water with a household cloth.
Attention is not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look at something else then I no longer read the book and have to log out and log in and load the book again and look for the place to where I have read it.
On Saturday, I have been communicating with you.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages.
Thank you very much!
Then I will buy somewhere else once the money is back.
But do I get it back in trouble?
Child wish treatment in PKV / What is a ‘insurance case’?
Hello together,
We've been in child care for some time now when it comes to billing with the PKV, it's suddenly cross.
The line after:
We had asked for the child's wish for guidance in advance at the PKV and received the promise over 3 attempts.
The attempts were not restricted in any way (e.g., time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and conducted 2 (succeeding) attempts, but did not yet calculate them with the PKV.
We again requested the cost acquisition at the PKV and again obtained 3 further attempts.
After some further attempts (we have made more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received the evil surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to retaliate 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise fail.
The second child’s desire is a new insurance case.
However, the case of insurance begins with the treatment, it ends when treatment needs are no longer exists.
Questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here to reimburse the PKV (only 3 attempts) or we (there are 5 attempts to retaliate)?
* Would the PKV have to point out in the promises that with birth the further attempts would fall?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by closed ovaries) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give your opinion here.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to get them back to me best
All right.
We will no longer order anything with them.
When they add the turnovers from me and my friend #NAME# (like address), they obviously have lost good customer.
You may want to pass it on to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the refund had been made and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back.
I can't believe that the commode is completely disturbed with me.
Please see in the screenshot what the college has written
It is clear and clear that the refund has been made and I still have not received a refund per #PRS_ORG#.
You can align your manager that they have now lost two tribal customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must maintain normal use.
Otherwise they may not sell him as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will be able to detach the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
We recommend these products with additional hooks to be purchased, but unfortunately we can’t find them with you.
Can you help?
Theme of the Week: The Best Low Budget Films
What a low-budget film is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no finding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as for example on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What's going on in you?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already set up 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Would you like to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle?
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it also reliable?
Thank you very much
With friendly greetings
There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is no chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position... I'll give up soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
\"Halber victory - linked to Belarus with high costs for the EU
In conflict with the Belarusian regime, the EU can announce a \"half victory\" to the political expert Raphael Bossong.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus - border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong said to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
After all, the EU has not resolved the confrontation, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) said.
This state of weakness - Belarus does not contribute very little, but the EU feels like a winner - it is likely that it will continue for a while.
The treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Clearly, there is a “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not stand firm against this, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens the cohesion in the Union.
“It is obviously not possible for a Member State to act if it is concerned about making its own thing, as current Poland, which does not even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, says Bossong: a principle agreement on asylum policy will be complicated as the line of border protection, border protection, border protection, and border protection has been strengthened.
Renewed attempt of cross-border crossing
According to Poland’s border protection, migrants have since again tried to reach the Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a spokesperson said on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been charged with stones in the incident not far from Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to the report, a soldier was caught in the face and had to be medically supplied by a military doctor.
In total, border protection 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
As early as Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or tried it.
The EU proposes Alexander Lukashenko as the ruler in Minsk to have attracted them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania report on border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to people’s countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
“There the EU has thrown its market power into the scale and proved its determination to operate with harsh bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk also had to take into account domestic costs.
The Belarusian society may not have been willing to insist that the security device regularly locks thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
Max Verstappen, according to Mercedes, is to have made two rule breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After Abu Dhabi's controversial Formula 1 final, Mercedes has filed opposition.
The silver arrows are thought to have two lines of rule in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is expected to have overrun regularly.
A second opposition was filed against the rating at the end of the race.
After Mercedes view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
On the last round, Lewis Hamilton had overrun the Mercedes and was caught for his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutch had taken over in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'm talking to the bank and I'll contact you again.
thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europe-Park is under SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa-Park, namekeeper for the Europa-Park Stadiums of the Freiburg Sports Club, has invited to SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park reports, members and permanent card holders of the sports club from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community on this day were allowed to visit the Europa Park for free.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausage.
On this day, the back rail trains lit through the jerseys red and white.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white air balloons provided the perfect setting - the park.
Since the early 90’s, cooperation between the Bundesligist and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed.
At the first SC Freiburg fantag in the Europa-Park, it has been shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing bright fans who have fun together in the back track confirms that, says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is the €#NUMBER# and not as originally 1699€ ?

I can't chat with them every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a re-order of the #PRS_ORG# night table and a return label.
This email hasn't come yet.
The package still wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me

But just because he says he's not an anti-Semit doesn't mean anything.
That's like if a dealer says he has nothing against foreigners.
Your i will not give it both.
But College constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to quit, you should just let it go completely.
Yes, then you're just as serious as Collegah.
Those who seriously question evolution are simply completely lost.
I think a God has put the whole thing into action.
But once you’re creative, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science is just inconspicuous.
And that is why you are a science enemy and don’t take any further seriously like Collegah.
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the lupe should be approached as close as possible to the eye.
The specially aplanatic-achromatically designed lens system allows you to use the lupe virtually ingestion and color failure-free to the edge zone.
Lupens are often characterized with enlarged data.
However, these details apply only to precise conditions that rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your lupe optimally, we ask you to observe the instructions in the “Technical Data” table (see user manual in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - i.e., even in the case of inserts - light reflections arise.
These mirrors are significantly reduced by an anti-reflex coating.
When the optimal conditions of use are met - lupe close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
You can find further information in the accompanying instructions for use (in German and English).

Tanning sales in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced so many kuriosis situations when selling lunches.
Once a man is to be returned home even without his partner because both could not agree.
Each year he plants well over 2,000 pieces for this.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many curiosis situations.
That always makes the Christmas time a little fun, he says.
And that with the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?
After all, I received a defective delivery and now pay the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly.
We don’t need to make any discussions about the better court here, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled at a turning spear.
Both have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be as much as the \"dreher\" that sounds far less delicious.
Problems with Glass Fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and broadcast 50 Mbit up to a few failures.
The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrives.
However, the other DLan module, which broadcasts the Wifi, no longer arrives at the full 500, but the more I remove myself from the house with the module, the less comes (so use a plug box that is 1, 2, 3, etc. space from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new glass fiber connection now on the first floor is even slower than before ( ~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which seems to be using a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also there were similar large losses here.
Could anyone explain to me why with glass fiber so much internet speed is about the power line “lost”?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to still move into the house LAN cable.
I’m really desperate, so I’ve created an account here.
That's why I'd be so happy about an answer.
When it’s time to switch the Giro Account
Who would have thought that now, for the first time in the Giroconts, peace would have been false.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the cost increases of the past with all kinds of tricks from their customers, the free payments for negative interest rates continue to fall.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has even half the amount of free money and even quadrupled for the day’s money.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered to 50,000 Euros at Giro and Investment Accounts and to 25,000 Euros for Daily Money Accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower free amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesperson on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for “new-made individual agreements with existing customers”
The Commercial Bank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as to ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the amount of money to two levels, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
In fact, more than 100 banks now have a free amount of €25,000 or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at €25,000: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which have, in the first instance, been granted legal rights in the district court of Berlin against this regulation.
It is now discussed in the banks whether the institutions should form possible returns - in the event that the above instances also explain the negative interest rates in principle for unauthorized and many millions of bank customers need to be paid back.
The table plate was delivered for 8 people instead of those for 6 people.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
Her life is like a mountain and valley.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was selected by the US magazine The Hollywood Reporter as the most influential woman of the year.
For them, who made Furore with the “Friends” reunification and the continuation of their series “The Morning Show” in 2021, this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
For their appearance, a whole army of assistants, stylists and coaches takes care of themselves.
After all, according to Aniston, they enjoyed a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a single chip from the bag).
The fact that you have the hearts of the female and male fans in the same way is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just pech with happiness - and still is looking for great love.
And the baby's wish was cut off from the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she became a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really harmful.
Keep hoping that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even lighter than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finnne pulled the gloves out and washed the sweat from the forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight tire touch, Räikkönen had to put down his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half of the race.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the \"Iceman\" ending his career in the motorsport royal class.
His wife Minttu and the two children were also sent to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He created 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the pole and came to the podium 103 times.
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup win - Nolte wins in Zweierbob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
“I thought that I had to make nine and a half wins per season, then I could make it up to Cortina 2026,” said the BSC Oberbearenburg double-Olympiaser, who was equal to two successes in two days at the Winterberg race.
It was only on Saturday that he resisted the attack by Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from grade three to one.
Then he changed something at the material setting and made a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbearenburg) and Alexander Schuller (SV Halle), he set out in front of the British Brad Hall.
The third became the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
“We went greater risk today and were rewarded,” said Friedrich, who also entered his 22nd victory in series.
Stuttgart-led Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner came in second place this time on grade five.
Christoph Hafer of the BC Bad Feilenbach ranked fourth in the first race in eighth place.
“If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do the same,” Holtner said.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third season win in Zweierbob on her home track.
After only fourth place in the Monobob on the previous day, she raced for the World Cup on Sunday in Germany's triple success with accommodating Deborah Levi.
Zweierbob Olympicswoman Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Revue came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she booked the first podium in this winter.
Dr. Kim Kalicki landed in the third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me, it was supercool, the first podium in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama takes me along.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay - said Burghardt and stressed: “It’s not just push, but there’s also a lot to do.
Jamanka was a little upset about the not completely fault-free rides, but said: “It’s going in the right direction.”
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn’t get him and therefore I can’t resolve it, which is why I finally asked him.
Through Corona, I had very different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now he was running away what made me very upset.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I want to return it and then order it again as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment only launched on 16.3.
There was nothing so long on your website.
No, it's only when I'm getting to that point that an extra field comes with the message.
It was taken yesterday from your wallet.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered ones.
But we want the shelf module anyway, a new undamaged one.
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello love great girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write and maybe it's the one that's going on - or others like that.
I'm 24, I have kPTBS, full-time student and dog emama - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go into the kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I still have emotional needs, and because I want to see and feel him, we've colded a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him with the shower (because hand is in the band wg burning).
He's cool on top of that and we're currently seeing less (1-2x week) that makes me very much to deal with my needs for affection and love.
My dog's baby just has stomach pain, I've bought for him and now he's in his custodial and has a bit of relaxation after I've been there with the heat lamp and strangled for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and that's just one month away.
We are still working at home, which we are of course sharing.
But even cooking is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is very well set, I am half well-theraped and ready.
Not good, but I'm ready and I'm almost symptomless.
My university just requires a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I haven’t done anything yet and in the morning anatomy hours for which I should prepare at least a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes this way: Only until the morning, then weekend is.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Just until the birthday.
Just until the beginning of the holiday.
Just until weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual points of reference because otherwise I'm packing that down.
Somehow I feel guilty and \"chaotic\" but otherwise I don't...
Are you doing the same thing?
Honestly, I am immeasurably grateful that I don't have to work.
I am really grateful, I can’t even say that in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I believe this also has some to do with Mental Load of Women, and that's why I thought I'm sure I'll find suffering companions here...
I definitely wish you a restful evening, the week has almost succeeded!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has print.
During the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we are going to exchange the table, do I get another color or how?
The e-mail for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
On the other hand, twice.
But she was not confirmed.
I found out at the school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is only another subject for them, such as math or earth science.
For me, it was always a bit strange, maybe even because I was brought up as a Christian and I always believed so.
What do you think?
You may also be able to talk about work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is meaningful to separate.
There is no curriculum, etc.
But just find it strange to have a physical teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What, then, does one want to teach religion if one does not believe it?
True culture or something?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can't change it or not?Do you like to write English I understand well
It's been a long time, and I'm going to leave it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a feedback up to the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #name#.
Search for movie help please
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (bin 24).
I think it has been a film for young people.
In the film, there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
\"The Modern World\".
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite certain).
Since I can’t describe it more in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom to live for myself, I mean.
The transition is also believed to be the graveyard of the soldier.
In the end, both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that's what I'm saying I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little girl slept on her stomach only from week 1.
Fast forward: still living :D
Relax.
Such a child is much more than you think.
Make sure everything is right, no custodials, often go in and watch, but not a minute of monitoring.
That makes you mad!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Axo and we didn’t have a sleeping bag, but we always had a blanket.
Observe your child when he sleeps.
Is it turning the head to the side?
Can something be raised from the belly?
Or is it with the face in front directly in the mattress?
You can tell them if everything is all right.
We have also all grown up and when my husband came to the world, it was zb gang and there was a time when you put the kids on the belly to sleep.
In addition, we’re already with you and have already bought a lot of items
But why do you offer me only 20 EUR?
Hello, I've been writing to a colleague of you yesterday and I haven't been able to report any feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the cabinet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not to be used right now.
To make it clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
Only it is so easy that the policy of this broadcaster is now under all the sauce.
Almost every format is sponsored (also), but then still go on a big bet tour at the same time.
It has been said that you are an “independent” Internet channel.
Arno: You don't want to be an ongoing column of literature.
What are you doing now?
A 0815 advertising station trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we still have Marahs Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, this applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They may, of course, continue to offend people.
A krogman who is completely lacking in empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How can you find it all right?
Great if you like, I'm afraid.
I would like to call back because my delivered wooden table was sent defectively.

Whether it’s a wedding dress or just a cue, my little warm friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Kirschkern pillows are a traditional home remedy for beneficial heat applications, since Kirschkern heat can be very well absorbed and dosed again.
The reliable inner pillow can be heated easily in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft reference makes the application particularly pleasant so that the little ones feel secure, even if it doesn’t go so well for them.
The Kirschkern pillow with reference is suitable for the following application areas as a heat charge:
Before heating the pillow, check for untypical smell, stock or fire spots and immediately remove them in presence.
Please take the inside pillow for heating out before!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (Notes from the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, the heat is distributed by shaking evenly in the pillow!
Then place the inner pillow in the reference.
In the first heating, it can be a light moisture formation on the surface, but it disappears in the case of repeated applications.
Be sure to adhere to the given heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance can cause damage (flammation and combustion risk!).
Check before heating the pillow in the microwave that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner pillow has been put back into reference, please check the temperature of the pillow for appropriate for babies (max 43 °C) at your arm’s leg!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverous diseases, circular complaints, fresh hematoma, bloodshed and open wounds as well as in people with reduced pain.
For existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please contact a doctor before using them.
If nutrients have opened and loose cores exit, remove the product and the loose cores immediately and unaccessibly for children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be regularly controlled during the application to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents occurring in connection with the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is located.
The reference is acceptable and washable in the machine at 30° C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 may dream of returning to the football national league.
In the meantime, Hannover 96 works from the table counter.
Ingolstadt does not run under the third coach.
Jubel in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed performance under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so I still need to work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough to operate.
The battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the plug-in power supply.
After that, I supported the battery, but there is nothing going on here.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can’t I use the laptop in the network operation?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seating area is...
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack of Peak Design, there is no problem!
20 liters of power also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely concealed using the pulsated FlexFold parts.
And what you still need on everyday items, thanks to practical access in the individually adjustable interior, remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment.
With the “Update” of Everyday Line on version 2 (V2), the series still presents itself in a new look.
The smart, minimalistic design has it literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to the photo equipment.
This works with two possibilities: once conventionally via the cover flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an extremely well-thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
In this case, there is a closure hook made of metal with suitable anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has designed a variety of “fillings”: there are 4 anchor beams, which can be fixed in which the closure hook can be locked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper one.
Clap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without touching the hook.
The second possibility is that the Everyday Backpack is also fundamentally different from other photo backpacks: in addition to the lid, there is still a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from above - you no longer need to cool through the content!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the daily beauty of the backpack: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
In Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more of it below) and thus easily separate from each other - and access it independently by the two lateral openings.
So you can also pull the backpack from the right side to the body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right main box, while the everyday swings remain secure in the left half of the backpack and do not come in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable wear belts help with this.
And since the outer cover of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weather-resistant Nylon, the contents remain dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I am waiting for the e-mail from their support.
#NAME# yesterday has me an email from confirmation for the appointment of the
Contact is announced by the Spedition for pick-up of the wrongly delivered table.
So far, I haven't received a message.
I ask for immediate resolution.
I am already writing with the third support employee, with no more than the promise that I will receive an email as a confirmation.
This is the return of the incorrectly delivered custom #NAME#
Is it possible to see when the cabinet could be returned?
Keeping it that way is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you so much for the help
Wish you a nice evening.
Hello, my orderer is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was 12.1.21.
A completely different lamp was delivered to me when I ordered it
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, I will give up a larger order immediately, but at the same time I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that the past year was different than thought I could not imagine and could not have solved it at the right time and explained it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept it.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to appreciate the requirements of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of the brake, even under difficult conditions.
Rotary brake discs are made of cast and then mechanically processed (bore and cut).
All thin discs are produced in short series according to individual technical properties, which are unique to certain disks and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created which is aimed at weighing the disc according to the properties of the original assembly.
The thin discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
In addition, the openings created increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake nodes.
Aesthetic properties of our tinted discs underline the character of every car by attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event marked the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River discovered shining brokers in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the novelty spread quickly and released the so-called ‘California Gold Rush’ from ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were cut off, tents were stored, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted to share the wealth of the country.
For many, it was called “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or Bankruptcy!)
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, combine horses and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to surpass your pioneer colleagues in order not to go along with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose at the same time your actions, need to keep your resources in mind and build a curriculum that works more and more for you (so-called Engine Building)
The buildings on your dishwasher allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or apply rules to your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual style of play with the help of fine adaptations.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the schedule where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
These disable the one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players perform alternate actions, such as the gain of resources, the movement of cars, the creation of tents, the search of rivers, the construction of bridges, the opening of businesses and the positioning of gunmen.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the start of each round, the pricer turns to a new location and thus changes the available actions.
This continues so long until the pricer has moved five times, so each location has been covered once and ends the year.
There is a shooting in which players need to defend Coloma before an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have been able to attend enough revolver heroes and are paying attention to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end at the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score takes place.
The player with the most winning points wins!

\"Why kids are not tyrants - Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right now.

With his book “Why Our Children Become Tyrans” (2008), he triggered a violent educational debate.
Former patient: In-laws now raise heavy charges against him.
Please watch out for you, the film is hard to endure.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible ones may never, never, never! go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on three-fold vaccination loss test requirement
At their next meeting, the health ministers of the countries want to decide on a nationwide three-fold waste loss of the test obligation.
“Our countries quickly need clarity as to whether and from when the test duty can be avoided for three times,” said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Minister’s Conference, the “Picture on Sunday.”
The fall of 2G plus for triple vaccines is not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional vaccine, Holetschek said.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that he will make a proposal for this at the Health Minister’s Conference on the next Tuesday.
So I want to send the lamp back.
How do I get there best?
Hello, I like the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seating area is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make a purchase via my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Ups, it occurred an error.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I updated account data.
What can this lie about?
What you are described as *awareness*, i.e. sense perceptions under full narcosis.
These occur at a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
The most common thing is to hear sounds/voices, to see images and most rarely to perceive pain.
For this subject relevant: Imperial cuts are operations that go along with an increased rate of awareness, as one avoids a very deep narcotic to protect the child from abjection.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during anesthesia discussion.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) go along with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex **per definition no.
Have you read her comment wrong?
However, the chair is defective.
I don't think the 20€ will help us either.
These are legal warranties.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again to see if they will take back at least the defective chair.
We sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I already sent you an email that you did not respond to.
Again the question.
In the order and on the account that the goods are delivered to a room of my choice.
The forwarder is company #name#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver on the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that the case?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry me the heavy furniture on the first floor.
I'm not going to call?
I had a question.
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died 97 years ago
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and an intendant.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
The new book is still on the table, press release: “An old man is getting older.”
The shocking diarium of a slow farewell from the world led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the message that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: “I’ve been witnessing my life thanks here.
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Europe-led, standard wooden pallets, which are used primarily in European space as charge carriers.
They are certified by the European Palettes Association EPAL
According to data from Austria statistics, more than ten million pieces of pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was about €79 million.
How many pallets are imported to Austria every year is not recorded
New York won MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After 1:1 in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided to finish in the Elfmeter shoot with 4:2.
In the finale of the Eastern Conference, New York had gone on against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had a lot of great tips for the perfect gulash here a week ago.
There was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and sweet!
Thank you again for this :)
Now I've come to taste and want to cook to Silvester the first time roulade.
I will use a cattle fund for tomorrow.
Do you have any tips for me?
Note: I have no oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is no longer good, but I get it.
IIt's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by e-mail on 18.01. that the refund had been made.
But to this day, the money has not gone in with me.
Would you please check there?
Where there are Christmas Bretts in the Lübeck area
For many people, gans or ducks are part of Christmas days such as the tanning tree and the gifts.
You haven't been worried about poultry yet?
Now the time is running out.
We'll tell you where you're coming from in the Lübeck area.
The “Drive” of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired level on the one hand and on the other hand the scar content of your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series’ amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce sound level without changing something on “gain” and distortion.
Furthermore, it has already been mentioned that with the POWER LEVEL controller, a power reserve can be made to flow if it goes loudly.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controller, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone bush can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so you get an eminent “acoustic” sound impression yourself when using a headphone or when directly recording.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX book so that you can jump to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice device.
Those who also donate a VFS5 foot-taster, who can easily call the sounds by foot, turn the effect blocks on/off and \"tapped\" the pace of the effects that follow.
For live use, this is really indispensable.
With his new power packs, VOX is going to take another step into the future!
But I've seen it in others.
Can you send the lamp back?
Is it too low for an dining table?
So I would like to send her back.
Can you help me further?
And the commode?
Do we receive an update to the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn’t, I would be satisfied with a leave or voucher.
I may find a customer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don’t need is a lot.
I just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
In the negotiations on the revitalisation of the international nuclear agreement, progress has been made in accordance with Iranian information.
“Both sides are about to take a look at some of the topics that are to be put on the agenda,” Iran’s chief negotiator Ali Bakheri said on Sunday, Irna’s news agency.
This is a \"positive and important development\" because at first there was no unity on the topics to be dealt with.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reinvigorating the agreement were continued after almost one-week interruption.
In the negotiations, negotiators of Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia participate.
A U.S. delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Sachsen - Free State now Bundesland with highest corona incidence
Sachsen has been disbanded and currently has the highest incidence in the country.
As the only federal country, the value is above the brand of 1000.
As the only federal country, Thuringia has been located at the Corona incidence on Sunday above the brand of 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the nation’s highest incidence, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but was also above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths were reported in connection with an infection within one day.
200 severe cases of Covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends there may be notice delays.
In addition, the health offices have been overburdened for weeks and are hardly behind with the detection of new cases.
I understand that.
Since delivery takes place in early March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print that and stick to the package and leave it at the post, was it?
I don't have to click/ input/fill in here?
This is exactly what I want to avoid, so I write to you.
I would like to take the return at my own expense.
8 Euro return fee is in my eyes a frequency.
It's time for changes
###M One day I am greeted, I am U/StratorDE in the Plenary Hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What is the post here?
When you look at the activity in the past few months of the day, you can see one thing: it is not extant.
We came to a winter star and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yeah, what happened?
For the most part, it might simply be related to dissatisfaction, as here are some things going on and how we generally stand.
In the last days, the impression has increased that many really have Bock on the Monday.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community is asked about the day of harvest, which they want to keep alive.
The start came from U/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last days and has found one, simply said, sharp-sharpen.
After some writing and writing, several people from the community have found themselves eager to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to specifically call on everyone to participate, only so this project can have an existence in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange each other, as well as work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How will the day of the harvest work in the future?
* What existing orders must be modified / modified / removed?
* How are we going to appear outside in the future?
* How are new members to be purchased?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some, but what's not bad is that we end up having the discord.
If you have time and desire, come to the discord, work with and let us make democratic decisions about the future.
I have ordered a lamp screen with you to be delivered.
Now I see that the item is too big/cluby for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension to you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad because the #name# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, is there also in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# needs to be able to guarantee that the wrong cabinet is picked up in time.
And I ask you to make that happen now.
I don’t have a suitable packaging, but I’ll unmount the cabinet as far as possible for the pick-up - they need to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by telephone to agree to a pick-up date.
Is there a manual for the installation?
How long would I have had time to care for them or decide to send them back?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I have a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian life for a while, but it is very rare to eat meat.
I was also a vegetarian a few years ago.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism has been a planned intermediate step, I have answered honestly without much thought.
And even though I long thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
So I decided to become a vegan.
At the moment, I had the impression that was on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and meant she knew where her flesh came from and reduced it as a vegetarian animal.
Now I wonder if my answer to 'plump' was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you as a vegan will quickly get stuck in a corner and conflict will arise without you putting it on it.
Greetings a Harmony-Loved Vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not remove you from the legal requirements for distance removal.
I am not on the date assigned when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return on site.
Since I can’t be on site because of a funeral, I can’t change that either.
Please allow me an alternative pick-up date.
From 01.02.#NUMBER#, I am coming back.
Lahnsteiner Wehr for water rescue equipped: 45,000 Euros of land
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz in the Lahnsteiner Rathaus handed an application order of €45,000 for the new equipment car water rescue of the Voluntary Firefighter Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was €135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us here,” says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The device car is used by the diver staff Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they carry out tasks in water and ice rescuing as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, you will be able to keep track of increasing operations: the tree of hotel shipping on Rhein and Mosel and the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure stream contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read up to 10% and then started the problems.
I can't open the book.
However, bin’s recommendations followed have been synchronised, removed and the app re-charged NOTS has worked.
I’m a bit frustrated because the whole action has cost me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection from #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

Thank you for putting the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar activity, we were also gun carriers in the executive, I don’t want to go on!
I always find the question of right and left to be very simplified.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the state servant is more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should actually be clear to everyone.
That, of course, in the special uniform and armament of people on the right of conservative magic, it should also be clear to everyone that these people can of course deal with the living reality is also clear, because of course, you have many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and therefore I don’t mean the excessive feminine clichés, because in the executive, there is more to be less than just normal men and women to whom you don’t notice if they can’t tell you about it) and I have to rely on these people because in doubt they save your life or set it up for you.
But even these edge groups also represent even though it sounds comical for the first time to my experience after a conservative attitude, speak proudly of Germany and feel more uneasy by excessive leftist policies, even if this policy is supposed to be used for them or if they feel they need to do it right, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the rights, of course, as police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they may openly express their opinion there, or even openly severing any government-prone plans, is medially completely exaggerated and angers me too.
Of course, police officers and soldiers who were often in foreign use often begin to stop due to negative experiences and even say things that are controversial until politically incorrect.
Also, it is certain that even right-minded fellows will meet up with a rainy exchange of thoughts.
However, what I think is well fought, and it also counteracts the whole with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so much international, and that’s also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have the right racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I don't understand, the other basket, I also ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, I was not sold out.
I have already ordered in November.
I was confirmed in your confirmation of the order.
It’s still about my order, which is no longer available.
I chatted with #name# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in Black to Germany or this basket is available anywhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
but on top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep candles filled with something yellow
And on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More orderly by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (by myself, very little leisure), but I have been able to lead it more badly than right to my household permanently clean and orderly.
There are always phases in which everything is lying, and then and when it packs me and I put up and put up.
But it’s never like that — that someone could come to visit on a spontaneous basis.
My husband is also not better, although it bothers me somewhere but most of the time, it simply loses the house against work and unsatisfaction.
The kitchen is still the most frequently cleaned as we like to cook.
Now on my question, have you managed to get better with the child?
We haven't worked yet and this question has been on me for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visit comes and for example there's always fresh clothes there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a greater incentive with your child or do you remain sloppy?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality and anatomy pre-formed cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows for almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preformation with special, further embodiment on the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee legs)

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have been training in software development and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am more and more aware that this profession is not the right one for me, so I have been considering re-starting and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or fear-inspiring) personality disorder (EVPS).
This means grossly that I don’t have a sense of self-worth and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people at the right level, but I find it very difficult to lead loose conversations and I have been told more often that I am acting in an inconvenient way (where I think I have already become better).
Can I become a social worker?
I don’t want to work as a street worker or in the open youth meeting, but rather in the search advice or family assistance for example.
But I don't know if the concrete day of work is really the way I imagine it, and it's difficult to find something on the internet.
The EVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it gets me down every time there is something to complain about my code, “my simplest things are being cooked again,” and it’s hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help, “I should really know what’s going on, and I’m going to stop him with my stupid questions from working.”
I will probably have the problems in every profession, but I would like to have mentioned them at the outset.
Have you already recovered the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for an appointment for pick-up
What do you mean by giving back?
If I have downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message will not come to your #PRS_ORG# authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein (protein) captured with the feed breaks the bird into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) in its stomach-darm tract and, in turn, builds its own protein, which it also needs for feed formation.
The animal formation in nestling and the animal reformation in the mauling bird are extremely complex processes and for the overall organism of the animal are associated with a particularly high stress.
Please note that NECTON-Bio is not to be administered during the breeding, as it may otherwise result in disruptions in the breeding process.
Following this curative dose of NECTON-Bio should be transferred back to daily vitamin supply with NECTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NECTON-MSA (mineral substance preparation).

1 g of NECTON-Bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft feed.
It is only advisable to prepare as much drinking water/weed food as the bird daily feeding and to change water/food daily.
A dashed knife (inside) corresponds to 1 g of NECTON-bio.
In the case of severe animal damage, the double or triple dose of NECTON-Bio can be given at first, until the approach of the feed reformation is visible.
After that, the normal dose is sufficient until the feed reformation is fully completed.
Storage: NECTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25° C.
Please apologize, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair go after 9 months broken?
The guarantee claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really bad service.
Hello, I've sent an email on Monday to tell that my order has been damaged and images have been hanged.
Have you received this email?
The statement of a municipal employee in a revocation to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property a Walnus tree is to be liked.
The case application was made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the case of fruit trees and thus also the whale is not part of the statute.
However, in the statement, the Walnuts are explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statement is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for this.
I haven't received a message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that only the question is yes, whether I can pay in Euro and let me deliver the ceiling to Germany
Can you check that?
Flight message: Heavy traffic accident in Selb

As the police press alarm is currently reporting (14:03 a.m.), a car has come into reverse traffic when it overtakes.
There are injured.
I'm okay.
Well, then, thank you again that it was so easy!
Council and Ideas on Further Professional Life
Happy Christmas to you for the first time!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is quite good because my better head just remembers everything you can think of.
Before I pick up here now .. in short: I need advice and the best of people who know my situation somehow - so from you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross-starter.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked there in one area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I call nothing more accurate here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point, I landed at the teaching office and was sure that it is - even if the conditions are significantly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but that was not for me.
I have now arrived at the third ‘I have google other job subscriptions’.
And it's only half a year.
In the past, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after which I can still swivel.
But I'm absolutely finished.
I had so little free time in the last month that I’m completely excited.
Now are holidays, but there is still a bunch of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there was also my weekend and my holiday evening.
I was free there.
And the stress at work was no longer at all in the moment.
Now the family celebration itself is too much stress.
And then there are these rigid structures that also make me nervous.
Basically, it makes fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well with regard to feedback and so on.
But I'm completely excited and wonder how much stress my body endures before it completely closes - if he's not already doing so.
I wonder if I would like this to be the rest of the working life - just when I read some of your contributions here - or if I wouldn't go back to the old area, since where I was valued, I could take free time if I needed it, and the work was found to be somehow boring, but was paid for it, and together in a team what has been accomplished and not as an individual fighter as it is now the most time of the case.
But then I wonder if in a year I didn’t get back to the same place as I’ve been now and unsatisfied.
You notice that it's all somehow weary, but perhaps you have come out as an outstanding advice or ideas, like I came out from this situation, which I am completely finished and almost at the smallest thought of it.
I’m not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, this probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views help me see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, that is enough for me to be the first.
Thank you for reading and apologizing to the winery undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX’s Valvetronix series has been constantly developing, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the “Valve Reactor” circuit which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand-new modeling engine that is absolutely up to date in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also, of course, contain the multi-stage valvetronix tube preamperator.
This is partly based on real analog circuits because they easily get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers provide a closed housing and a bass reflection system from which the natural resonances only sprung.
With VOX’s Tone Room software, you can even correct and link historical facts at the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound as you’ve always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has since been several times refined to meet new sound requirements, which has again led to a performance shift in the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and crucially improved amplifier models.
From the manual VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed in such a way that all the guitarists are looking for a maximum sound range here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced display of game dynamics and string attack as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the final stage determined the tube character of an amplifier and developed VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier fitted with a 12AX7 tube forms the behavior, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier perfectly.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The defeat series of Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - for the victory against the Los Angeles Clippers, however, it is not enough.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother, the Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main box is also adaptable: with three individual plastic and foldable cleft parts, it is all right according to the need of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the objects.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with a set objective, two to three alternate objective and a plug-in flash.
Greater DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more objects.
In addition, you can still store a lot of accessories.
And who has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for its equipment and for photo-friendly things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack provides sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest of history
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused major damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the famous history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
To date, the outbreak of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, with 84 days as the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data about previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has declined somewhat in the past few days, but volcanologists continue to dare to predict when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowing.
The best news is that they are stable - said the president of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV channel RTVE.
Damages in millions of heights
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees of hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick lava layer.
This corresponds to nearly 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage being estimated at more than 900 million euros.
From off the coast, a cold lava created two new landings with a size of about 50 hectares.
It was particularly affected by the massive banana cultivation for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and who were already in crisis before the eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely affected, the newspaper El País wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is at the door, and especially the children will not be able to expect the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have been associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the bubbling tension somewhat seductive in themselves.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of gifting, so that the gesture of gift, which, according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, has been a peace-building, social contract of natural peoples, can escape the rigid routine and be re-filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became a Christian child
It was hard for the Protestants, through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the beehive.
In the past, gifts were passed on to Nicholas Day in one way or another.
The background of this still popular seat is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw three women into her window secretly one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional form of gifting, the need in Germany became popular to fill the boots, especially the children with gifts.
Protestants are at odds with this need because they reject mediators between God and man as “saints worship.”
For these reasons, they refrain from the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christ Child from the Nikolaus and founded a new tradition line.
The focus of the beehive shifted to the holy night.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detail questions so closely, it only angers the least that the need for Saint Nicholas is similar to Martin's use with Martinsingen and Martin's move is still a solid part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today you will find in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to desired luxury watches everything the heart desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the reformation, the day of the donation shifted to Christmas.
In all the Christian countries, however, there is a cheerful cuddle about the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region in question whether the child of Christ appears on the Holy evening or the Santa Claus, who in principle is a type of Nikolaus, which in time has been assigned some of its own types.
This includes, for example, his white noise beard, which has little to do with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled, which is pulled by pensioners and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana, which should have given them the way to the child of Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes fables bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought twins Frost to some fame.
Here there are not renters, but three horses that pull their sleds as Troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the child of Christ is responsible for the surrender of the gifts.

Police kill alleged bank robbers near the King Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told me that callers had reported a man who was to go to a bank with a gun and the business of a bookmaker.
The man fled according to the authorities in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials a little later.
The shots fell and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the place of death.
The police did not go from a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the Kensington Palace area.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative light fits harmoniously into every beet, garden area or stone garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth sprays.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt Solar Module for optimal charging of the installed battery.
Light duration max. 10 hrs.
- The robust plastic output can be used in the outdoors throughout the year.
In the Hollywood Spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from remote galaxies that thrive inside in color.
On the other hand, it is quite harmless: the sun alone makes this solar light shine fascinating, preferably in white or colored light (in at least six different shades of color).
The sideless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a nature-shaped large shell, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic rounds fit in every natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone beet.
Well, he also makes himself in the neighborhood of larger sisle and findlings, where he knows how to claim himself thanks to his size.
Large advances can be saved: As a solar light, \"Smart Stone\" does not require supply or batteries.
Place the \"lightstone\" in any spot that appears from the sun in the daytime.
Two co-supplied earth sprays provide firm hold if necessary.
The matt-white plastic cover itself is robust and weather-resistant.
Its solar module hides “Smart Stone” discreetly in its interior, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery already loads when sunlight falls on the housing.
In the event of ingestion, “Smart Stone” begins to shine automatically; in which color, you decide for yourself: Same six attractive light colors are available to you - in addition to daylight white - for choice.
Finally, the turn off is done automatically as soon as the battery load stand has sunk to a predetermined minimum or it will be bright again.
As soon as the sun appears again, the charging cycle begins the next day from the front.
I’ve done that several times it doesn’t work.
I would have liked to order further with you, but if the voucher is not charged to me, I will no longer order from principle.
If you're thinking otherwise, you'll give me notice.
Otherwise this was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
In the lockdown, anyway, no building market has opened...
The engine control of the LokSound 5 has been greatly improved again.
A variablely adjustable PWM tract frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a superlissed operation in the case of bell anchor engines, the typical \"brumming\" belongs to the past.
The load control can now be adjusted with up to 10 CVs in difficult cases.
The unique “autotune” function enables the decoder’s automatic measurement to the engine.
The LokSound 5 decoder supplies enough juice for older engines with up to 1.5A motor power.

Pill problem
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
I hope I do everything right here, is actually my first post after a year of reddit.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shot PMS before the period.
Now I would like to keep it back because I have to take enough medication through chronic diseases that I can’t choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had received about two-year breaks from 0 to 100 explosion-like pickles at my last two-year break, and they everywhere.
To the extent that it is superficial, but it has been very nice to me and I don’t feel comfortable.
In the past two years, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this time.
Perfume-free and without teeth is my cosmetics already, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
I don't think women's doctor has taken me so seriously, and hey doctor's appointment is still coming.
Thank you so much to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the skin is so new.
Had bad neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale button flies and the acne theme.
I have also tried all possible food in the course of the disease, and I have remained hanging on no sugar, milk and meat- poor mixed food because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It may also be good that Hormonally is simply the worm inside, but if you like me everywhere you don’t want to go looking anymore what’s going wrong.
I already had everything of my colleague Semina O. . .
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concerns.
I always have to work on the phone and there was suddenly everything gone...
What is there to test if the money were there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
But there is him in general in large
Since it is available in black large

In the name of the people: laymen fall with judgments
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothing on the judge's bench.
But much depends on their judgment, even if they do not wear a robe: scavenging with professional judges determines whether and how long someone goes behind bars.
Two of them report in a conversation with the “Current” from their time at the Bad Kreuznach Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuz are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the Landgericht on John-F-Kennedy Street.

110-kV earth cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legal.
The government’s plan-setting decision opens the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-mile (2 km) earth cable will connect the Tann span in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt treatment between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected near the town of Edermanning at Reut to a mast of the freeway.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts with us so far.
The blue bet cell number:#PRS_ORG# with the broadcast number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the notice \"Unable to supply\"
All three other packages have arrived so that delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the next process is?
A nice start to the week!
You can forget this, I explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a commode made of glass and the entire sides are placed, so there is glass everywhere and the carton is broken.
The commode is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to enter the apartment due to the #PRS_ORG# terms
This means that the commode cannot be picked up because no one in my apartment is allowed to clean
Thank you for the message
But why only EUR 20?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it’s all books, so yes, the question is #PRS_ORG#, because it’s probably a general problem.
Ref: Planning lessons (IK)
Hello, my colleagues and colleagues,
I’ve been in the Ref since summer, teaching makes me fun, but I currently have big problems time-efficiently planning my lessons in the Erdkunde field.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so I can use only the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium in principle.
In school, I can also only copy s/w for free (what makes soil nervous).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and I am actually standing for every hour.
In principle, I always repeat the methods, but on the other hand, I also don't want to invest too much time for simple hours of instruction (I need them for UBs, etc.).
I’m actually always going out of the learning goal (what I want to achieve) when planning and then thinking about how I can build it (most of the time I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn’t have).
We have the book Terra and with most tasks in the book I'm rather unhappy.
Therefore, the worksheets too.
Maybe I can get an earthenware teacher on how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to finish the return for the first time as soon as possible.
Trade is afraid of Christmas because of the 2G rule.
In most businesses, only those who are infected or cured are allowed to do so.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complained of revenue breaks.
He also has a possible solution.
From the perspective of the Trade Association of Germany (HDE), the 2G rules spoiled the important Christmas business.
In cases of cases of non-dayly need to complain, HDE chief executive Stefan Genth criticized.
According to a recent survey of HDE among 1100 traders, more than 70 percent of companies looked at the remaining days of the year negatively.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
“What should actually be the positive peak of the year is now often a hole without ground,” Genth said.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It only runs well in food retail as well as in the online sector.
The association demanded consequences from dramatic development.
Shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, the chief executive said.
“2G when shopping does not bring us further in the fight against the pandemic,” he stressed.
The current regulations deterled customers and required high staff use.
He called for a federal approval of the trade regime.
After that, each customer had to be checked only once on 2G (imprisoned or cured) and had access to all stores with the band received that day.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transport in the 3G rule (impacted, cured or tested) - aid checks should be sufficient.
The property company Deutsche Euroshop, specialized in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at a good 75% of the pre-corona level, turnovers at about 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of such an important Christmas business, said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the “Agricultural Week”
Due to the high staff and administrative effort, the Center will try to find and get solutions.
This includes the so-called band solution, where “the visitors can, for example, provide their 2G message at a central location in the center once and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to that in a club hotel - safely enter all shops - dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratcher and on the frame is also an error that has been tried to be cast with a yellow filler.
That's not beautiful.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already packed it back into the package and glued it.
How should I continue for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color display.
The setting of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp provides a modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to operate.
The lamp produces a very light stream with soft light of high quality, completely flash-free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees with which you can light large areas at relatively small distances is excellent.
Also in reporter situations in small spaces or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It’s a great tool to work on both the film set and the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows remote control of the light in TV studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a shining display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery scope)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to carry out the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces, one of the memory keys is simply supported and completed by longer pressing.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when the known situation is re-stopped, the camera is set to certain color temperatures in the studio work.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with a favorable NP-F battery.
These are often already owned by photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can access existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester equal to built-in - for each of the two battery vessels a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is, of course, possible to continuously supply the headlight via the supplied power unit with electricity.
The design of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for fastening, so you can direct to your photoatative.
The inclination is to be reliably adjusted by means of fasteners on both sides.
It has been noted that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a conical joint is included in the supply range.
A bag is also included in the delivery range.
So you can safely transport or store the light with all the accessories you may still want to buy without any problems.
It's a shame I've been given and it's too small :(
\"Party We Wanted to Smell: Frankfurt celebrates after terrific comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in series, victorious Hesse was supposedly on the way to the next Bundesliga-Pleite.
But then, within a good hour, the SGE turned to the frustration of a growing season start from the soul and defeated Furios with 5:2. \"It's madness what the boys have done today - cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke out a \"paushal praise, to each one who was with it\".
At first, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters now in grade nine, behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick led the Leverkusener with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
“How the players have come back and shown a fantastic performance,” Glasner continues.
I am mad at the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Even defense player Christopher Lenz, who had been back on the scene for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, emphasized the morality of his teammates.
“I think our mentality is incredibly big,” said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result in particular for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to beat today.
However, Glasner wants to keep the focus in mind for the upcoming tasks, but also sees himself well in terms of the staff situation.
It is extraordinary that we all have players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now you want to ‘go step by step and stay modest’ and carry out the tasks up to the year change’ at this level.
Next, on Wednesday in the course of the English week, there is an outdoor game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 p.m., Sky) on the program.
I get the mail that my package comes back to you because of an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent to me directly again or do I have to wait until the money is returned and the order is returned?
I'm sorry to hear that I won't order again because it's been very long.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women before quarter-finals against Spain
Germany's handball women shrugged after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty views of the parking lot.
At 16:32 (8:13) before 800 spectators in Granollers, the DHB election was held at 16:32 (8:13) and must now run against host Spain in the quarter-finals.
“We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent,” Federal coach Henk Groener said.
We have to be different against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as the second behind the Danes (10:0).
It’s a shame that we couldn’t take the flow.
This was a bad game that we had to delete,” said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for entry into the semi-finals, against the 2019 World Cup-seconds, a significant increase will have to be made on Tuesday to keep alive the tender dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German placekeeper in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back-to-back player Alina Greiseels with six goals.
\"We were simply not there - neither in the attack nor in the defence - room player Xenia Smits asked, \"We need to look forward now quickly\"
No height from front to back
Unlike the previous five tournament games, the German team with the offer was not up-to-date.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defence were responsible for a quick 0:4 return after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented with some parades slummers.
The first goal was reached by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Griezeels successfully completed a quick counteroff.
However, this was not the initial flame.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves in scene - and if so, they usually failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the match was run at 3:10 after 20 minutes early, especially backroom player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later because of a tough foul at her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get a little better in the game and at least on five goals until the break.
The only hope for a pick-up after the change was after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Greeners had sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-positioned opponent, who was among the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer stand out for a performance increase and went off the parking lot as a clear loser.

The title is that I am active as an vaccine in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is used in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to be done in a large part, it will continue to be part of the vaccine centers for me.
I like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical issues, unless they are personally related (e.g., “I take drug X, this is tolerable with vaccination.”
In my field of work, the education for vaccination, the indication position (person has the right to vaccination according to coronampt regulation and no reason to speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in allergic reactions (I have never happened).
The vaccination itself is delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often don’t have any with it, but “only” (for God’s sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, but who can’t do vaccinations (doubts?), so that I do most vaccinations myself there.
Heavy-Huidler Question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a 'huidler'?
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger, the BR television broadcast “We in Bavaria” has been provided for fierce reflection.
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series “Host mi” remained undisputed by the callers.
No, it wasn't a \"human being who's nervous\"
And no one, who has to go fast.
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
On which the man from Amberg informed the solution, and thus, in many of the upper palaces, he was likely also surprised.
\"The skiner - the spectators learned, \"is a lap with which someone wipes out the oven\"
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been surveyed by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived from some of the more well-known word of mouth \"keepers\"
With which an educational gap was closed - probably also with several who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I can no longer buy books for 2 weeks.
After the confirmation, the following error message always comes: open - so if wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#s, connected, synced and repaired with the PC.
Nothing helped.
Rear selection in the race- really so pan-proof?
This morning I woke up full of activity because I wanted to train at least a little bit to prepare for my bike tour in the coming week.
Saying, did, and I went out with my race bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then what happened in such a downtown (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) was what happened.
Glass splitter on the route.
Zack, loud cynics and my back tyres did not want to make the rest of the route any more.
Because I had no real opportunity to take care of my replacement coat and spare hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with half a bad sound and take the first train home.
So it wasn’t quite that bad, maybe it’s better when I practice this with the tire change again before the bike tour.
Now, however, I am facing a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route over several days in front of me, I would get extremely anxious about this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, as the old tyres of the former owner (very nice old man, on the day I picked up the bike until 14 o’clock 120km have been torn down!) and who had already called it a sub-optimal because he had been on the roll with them for several years.
However, if I think I have to make another tire change when driving to 80-90kms, I really believe I'm a bad man :D
Now I've come into conversation with an older man on the railroad, who wondered why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; these should be inflatable.
Now, of course, the whole sounds very tempting.
But are these really so uncautious?
I've had a lot of fun spending 40€/rivets now, just to get disappointed.
I also ask myself: at the moment on the race bike I believe 25x622.
There are also (likely?) tyres in the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority are wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me on other tyres in a racewheel?
The Schwalbe page seems to be my absolute! Laiewissen rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and love greetings!
Car sled against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old was on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unexplained cause against a central island and then guessed on the opposite track, as the police reported.
There came a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then pulled against a tree and the man stuck in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old companion were seriously injured in the accident and taken to surrounding hospitals.
yes we have we deleted all books everything bnew authorized and loaded new books

After the release of our new High End Broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would be restored.
SOLO 15 refers to the new spruce and visualally reminds of the great examples with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this design proposal, an appropriate designed foot is connected directly with it to lift the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This does not affect acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in the length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people in which the maximum volume plays a more subordinate role, but it is soundly intended to achieve an extremely high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered such large sound pressure level.
However, that does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the other hand, she appears highly adult and is extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonal, the SOLO 15 was matched with a slight increase in height.
This is common in broadbands in order to optimize the strongly increasing alliance at high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 with a very clear and fine sound is precisely oriented to the listening area.
The high pitch range can be reduced slightly outwardly and the sound image can thus be designed warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is knife-sharf and amazingly precise.
The reference suspects extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100-6 OHM ensure a fine dynamic that seeks its same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution capacity and accuracy.
As with all of our designs, it is advisable to start thinking about the final optics of the speaker to plan appropriate changes in the construction process.
If, for example, you want to build the housing, the reduction of the speaker needs to be adjusted accordingly, since the Furnier once again orders material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), an 8 mm hole should first be drilled into the bottom plate at the corresponding location in order to be able to operate the cable easily there later.
With the help of an upper mill, the speaker opening now follows in the front so that the B 100-6 OHM can be used later.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° phase in order to form the opening surface of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screwing points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the phase, as shown in the “Detail Phase” picture.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the ground are now glued to them.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in material strength if necessary, if, for example, you want to go back to finished performances from the construction market instead of producing them from 16 mm MDF themselves.
In the next work step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, so the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circuit saw or a forest drill, the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connecting clamp on the back wall are made easier.
A round miller is then used to round out all edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the base plate can also be rounded.
After that, the base plate is firmly glued with the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screwes.
The following is the drawing and pre-bore (2.5-mm drill) of the screwing points of the speaker chassis and the connecting clamp.
After the housing has been cleaned by wood dust (sucking/blowing out), you start by laying the cable.
This is most easily achieved by the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
In this case, the entire and unshortened cable piece for piece is moved through the 8 mm bore into the foot to the terminal opening and allows it to stand out about 30 cm there.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is guided to the speaker opening and it is also allowed to hang out loosely there.
The frequency week is prepared and used below.
The design plan of the frequency week, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document:
If the frequency wave is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box, which is not yet completely closed.
By means of the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot adhesive onto the opening and close it in this way.
By opening the B 100-6 OHM and with a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
The damping follows according to the description.
The B 100-6 OHM is then connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) at the plus pole of the speaker (greater contact) must be dissolved.
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the given length of 28 mm (inch length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I already leave an order and leave it at the beginning of June?
> Hello to everyone,
> Finally, we can announce that we will also be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> For well-known reasons, we are not able to get more than four people to the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-termity of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per switch, so that we will track the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic - yet we'll give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> It will be about 0:30.
Once you have drinks cold, plant good food and prepare for a long but very interesting night.
