Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, total they come to 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous major coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought the preferred parliamentary elections from Sunday to Austria after the first preliminary results.
In particular, the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) suffered losses where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer was seriously on the kipple.
In contrast, the election leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the State Head of State Jörg Haider, prepares for a triumphal return to federal politics.
According to the previous results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but it loses 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the ÖVP cut, losing almost nine percent of the vote by 25.6%.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian post-war history, and especially in the People's Party, which had requested the preferred elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
Even in early July, when the ÖVP emerged from the coalition, the People’s Party had a clear lead in front of the SPÖ.
The voters, however, probably punished the party for failing the government.
Even in the first responses to the results, there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely exit from the electoral debacle, i.e. to an extension of the major coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) received 18 percent provisionally, the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - but at the same time the Social Democrats expressed their fear that the year 1999 could repeat when the People's Party agreed with the Populists (at least the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which even caused sanctions from the European Union.
This development obviously puts Jörg Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with each party and goes from a return to Vienna to the Austrian Federal Policy.
The party of the Greens, however, suffered slight losses and dropped to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the quarter-percent and has therefore not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool
If it failed to solve the problem with Czech scientists accused in India of the illegal collection of beetles, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg might come to a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasized by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian colleague Pranab Mukherdshi.
“If this is not clear, then it will come to a certain cooling,” he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said, according to the talks, in judicial matters, the executives can only intervene hard.
Despite all of this, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released from the charge and received a fine, the central government wants to deal with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case the case falls.
“His problem could be cleared,” the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, it would be Mukherdshi's view would be the best if he would go in call at a higher instance.
He could so ask for release for bail and wait for his judgment in freedom, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner has also expressed himself in negotiations.
“He recommends a call to a higher court, then comes for him a favor,” said the chief of Czech Diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to let the convicted “competent legal support” grow, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said such help is already being offered by the Indian side.
“We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that, according to Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, according to the Czech Press Agency ČTK, in front of its partner, the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists to be of great importance.
“We really think it’s a big mistake to arrest and charge these Czech scientists,” he said.
An answer to the question of whether from the Indian side he was given the promise to deal with the matter, which the minister was.
“I’ve already been quite promised a lot,” he simply stated.
A Chechen directed over the ringing around the sea ground
It enters an electronic map where Australia and the adjacent sea areas are depicted.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and together with it is also the adjacent sea ground.
The area is as large as the continent itself, according to Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuo, who is one of the thirty-seventh member teams of the UN Division of Oceans and Sea Rights.
His chief, Division Director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, is pursuing the interpretation and complementing it to and from.
Here is work Elan and enthusiasm.
So far, the sea ground has a little-known world that is rich in natural sources.
Here, oil can be found, more ore and other non-advanced raw materials, but also to date unknown living organisms, which, for example, bear the key to developing a drug against cancer.
A seabed, larger than the mainland
Today, the Anrainers have vehemently declared their claim to the new sea areas.
After a UN convention, they make use of their rights to which they agreed in the year 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shell, which often reaches the sea from a country a hundred kilometers away.
This country, according to the Convention, has an exclusive claim to all sources of the continental shell.
“Simply expressed, the continental shell is considered the part of the ocean floor and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It exceeds the boundaries of the shore, often including the two-hundred-mile border of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The application presented by the relevant Commission country to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a comprehensive scientific-tech documentation that relies on many cost-enforced investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation work.
“One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three last named countries have been successful, adding Mikulka.
On an international echo, Australia’s success was short-lived, which as the first country could significantly increase its sea areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the seabed, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, i.e. about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigation.
The profit that will result from the use of the ocean floor in the future will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other states will also gradually submit their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratified Montego Bay.
Where the continental shell ends, the area of the ocean floor, which is referred to by the Convention as “a common heritage of mankind.”
There is no longer a special position here.
The right to promote in this area is granted to an international institution established by the Convention.
“The sea floor is not a gold-graved land, however, with some exaggeration director Mikulka and adds, whose areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored.
Czech Republic in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is also part of the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former East Block as part of the Joint Organisation Interocean Metal
This was given in 1991 due to the convention, as well as the investors of some less other states, the status of a so-called ‘rail-breaking investor’.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is parted there, it is a type of tatra on the sea floor.
“There can be a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan, according to another lawyer, the Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev Division brings with it such a concretion as a pattern.
She reminds of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the saying shem that raised the legend to life after the Golem.
German special forces were on site at hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had asked for help to solve the hostage crisis from Germany - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come into use.
In the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt, more and more details are known.
According to the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue action.
Hence, both specialists of the Federal Armed Forces and officials of the GSG 9 were the Fliegerstaffel of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminalist and logistics experts of the Technical Aid plant at the site of liberation.
However, as spokespersons of the Ministries further announced on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because hostages had their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the help offered by Germany to integrate it as a support force on the ground.
“For this reason, it’s fortunately not come,” said a spokesperson for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had kidnapped the group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian, and their eight Egyptian companions on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the abduction in a desert area in southern Egypt, hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad had been dragged back and forth.
The identity of hostages remained unclear until the last time as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The grids have now arrived well-kept in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the custody of the German Embassy.
For details of the release, he did not express himself.
At first there was no information in Berlin when they returned to Germany.
According to the Photo newspaper, the five vacationers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has barely failed the $700 billion heavy rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went out to the depth.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority of the program with which the chaos should be slowed down to the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the advocates had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion heavy package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on the MPs to vote, even if the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t yet taken place,” he said.
Over the course of the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent or by 600 points.
Reasons were the investors' concerns, the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, then, after the failure was announced, he collapsed again.
Experts are now looking forward to further severe turbulences in the international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary for an entry into force of the programme.
Organisations report increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour organizers:
In travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year according to a study - for the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
In spite of weak economic outlook, the German’s desire to travel remains unbelievable.
When booking for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a 31 percent sales rate compared to the previous year’s season, as the Deutsche Reiseverband (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK market research institute, booking figures have already increased for the autumn months.
Thus, the sales increase of travel agencies for October amounted to around eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
The basis for these results is GfK figures, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and accounts for the overall market.
The travel bookings will be recorded by the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak dollar rate, travel to the United States was asked, the DRV said.
There are around one-third of the booking growth here.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic filds, are particularly requested destinations for the Germans.
In particular, Easter trips were high in the course, DrV President Klaus Laepple said.
In view of the rising cost of energy and food, the costs here are better calculable to customers than on an individually organized holiday.
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early book discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple said.
The summer months have also been very well booked so that a sales increase will be recorded again in the previous year, although according to a further study the number of Germans taking a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from litre-krügen and promise in designer-dirndln.
A Wiesen debut.
Susanne Kron sugar and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blond, television fashionr and wears a custom-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is secondhand.
One thing, however, connects us: about three minutes in the show, the photographers are already crashing on us and cutting the memory cards full - very tasty and that on my first visit to the show.
That's how you make friends.
The Cheap-Dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As Wiesen-Touri and actually located north of the white-rooted quator, the well-being was still within bounds until date.
But once on the scene, everything is half that bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks at it or touches it embarrassingly - everything completely normal.
Rare views at the Schokobanane stand only eat my dirndl scarf.
A muncher made me realize that I had mistakenly bound the scarf: \"Left hoist free, middle virgin, to the right, to the left, to the back.\"
Homely, I'm freezing the loop from the back to the left.
“Say it and laugh.
Others make less effort for subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats, on which “To drink to get dressed” and stretch the naked back of an unsolicited one.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is named Bob, comes from England and visits the October festival for the first time.
He finds it \"gorgeous\" with a long-sleeved \"oooo\"
He tells me that after he rids himself of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of these hydrogenators, all of whom think he is a trasher.
Bob is one of those infamous \"Wildbieslers\"
Others are not lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, Sanitizers run in barns over the fortress, who have to take care of the poor slickers.
The nurses always appear in the rubble - always four at once drag a covered carry from tent to tent.
This works like most Wiesen visitors: Empty back, full back.
Those who are under the plane in the promille-sarg are not seen.
“These are the ones that pack more and more,” one of the Sanitators called me on request and disappeared in the twilight.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being launched in Essex by a vehicle was announced.
Carole Paulson, who lived on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was brought to Queen's hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident due to suspicion of light-hearted driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey expands diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey attempted to join the European Union, European powers were interested in penetrate deep into Turkey’s hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the guide tells you.
The building sits at the end of the railroad with a tower at each corner of the front and looks like any provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is destroyed about
But once you’re inside the branded ticket switch, there’s no doubt about the achievement of the project, the most Western access of which was that.
The railway station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Bagdad Gesellschaft.
Germany, which was a late-to-last in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions, dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany’s imperialist projects were paralyzed during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, generated by the invincible boundaries of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces withdrew from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha railway station.
In 1917, a munitions train flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disappeared, far from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gate to Anatolia and all east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of the Tükei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the Agency, has introduced a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from neighboring regions, generated by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of approach.
Interestingly, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splitter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to be able to assess the corner data of this new foreign policy, I went to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of slavery, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a hollow ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city, for the new worldly state action plan to return to the Ottoman past.
However, the agenda, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity
This has caused a lot of distrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the headquarters of the airport, a specially crafted, ultramodern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-finished shopping centers and cuttings in which middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first shops of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party of Europe.
Dress up, tie, I'm sure he's even packed a blackberry.
“The aim of the party’s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighboring countries.
The Cold War was an exception, he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There is no one or the other.
You had to do both.
\"But certainly Turkey could at some time - I asked, \"be forced to decide -
“Turkey, he said, did not want to make this decision.
He then pointed out a point that almost everyone with whom I spoke here said almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, in the sense that, as a whole, Europe can travel east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's train station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German rulers Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had looked forward to building this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now, too far, be in the hands of Turkey.
And while waiting for the ferry to take me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called “the sick man of Europe” in those days.
At least at the time, there seemed to be little doubt as to which continent should have a claim on this fascinating country.
In the memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: As Guildford's musical leader since 1962, Vernon's death-handley (revocation on September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
He was intended for young people until 21 years, but when the choir last sang in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name “Proteus” (the mythological form changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music that was presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical diversity of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and existed only because of the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for music, which over years has never passed.
How often did we die to “let the music speak for ourselves”?
He said, “The composer knows what he wants.”
It's all in music.
So it sings,
His manner of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never oriental, but never overwhelming.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the last 40 years, I have written criticisms for over one hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by a single one - often I have been inspired by them.
Death Handley was the rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He rejected conductors who, according to his words, simply “came home with one or two well-known creators in the world.”
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your review for William Woodruff (25 September), you write that “he resumed teaching economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950... while studying at the same time for a BSc, a MA and a doctoral degree.
This is a conclusion from an author’s comment in Woodruff’s book “Besides of Nab End” but it’s not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, who was later published as the British rubber industry in 1958.
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, spending the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to hide this part of his career.

`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life' because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, in documentary style.
They made me pay attention to them because of their simplicity and because of the power they emit, as they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.

Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda began marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large-space limousine offers a much larger one.
This also includes the technical fines that allow even more convenient driving and saving gasoline.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made at this major limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasized.
However, before you start analyzing the new model, it must be said that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for shorter periods of time.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon as to its sales in the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and also in the course of this year 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, around one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market market was the Old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83,000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates are on 10,000 cars, which are 17% of the estimated growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 jazz models since 2002.
As for the new generation of the model, the head of the branch in Spain expects to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
Viewed more precisely, it allows the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model to hide the sales decline in Spain.
In reality, the leader of the brand hopes to complete the year with total sales of 22,000 models, which are 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain over the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a 5-door hybrid car with a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models per year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer’s market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States while remaining shares are distributed in the Old continent and Japan.
The appearance of Insight on the market is intended for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has grown to be 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with increasing the dimensions, the interior space is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel container, a solution also used in the predecessor model of jazz.
The capacity of the suitcase space, which has a system of double loading surface, also reaches up to 339 liters, i.e. 19 liters larger than the capacity of the first generation suitcase space.
It must be emphasized that these measures are present in the version with a 1.4 litre engine, because the capacity of the case room of Honda Jazz with a 1.2 litre engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except for the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque power for the entire engine life.
The first variant with 1.2 litres achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 rotations with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reached 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp during the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of gasoline consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
‘Auto bees’ that avoid collisions
In order to drive forward the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the bad behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from Nissan Motor Co.’s technical development centre have developed these small robots in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology from the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the head of technology PR and R&D brand management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot should ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important is the bee’s eyebrows, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows you to fly safely in your personal airspace without interruption.
In order to imitate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It notices obstacles that are at a distance of up to two meters before BR23C and are in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object, and sends a signal to a board-owned microprocessor, which is directly translated into signal for avoiding the collision.
`At the moment when deficit is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and change direction immediately by turning its wheels at 90o or even greater angles to avoid collision.
The biggest difference between other systems is that this alternative maneuver is absolutely instinctive.
If it were not, the robot might not be able to respond with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratory for Mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can not move upward or lower, but not across the surface; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in an infinite way, as it does the bees.
For this reason, in addition to acceleration and braking functions, Nissan has used the rotation function so that the small robot avoids collisions.
`This device only needs to process the information every few seconds and act on this information.
It does not require neither to store the information nor the intuitive logic of the maneuvers done, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozens of KBs of storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs and not even the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan will introduce to the series cars over the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and hold longer than the diversity of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to lead up to the target when driving and thereby avoid obstacles on the way.
She's on the verge before she's burdened with a mortgage.
It must be taken into account that the U.S. Department of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid U.S. citizens becoming involved in mortgage stories of alleged payment-able banks, an entertaining and informative game for the Internet surf was developed: `Bad Credit Hotel', it said.
Or maybe the ‘hotel of bad loans’ or the interlocutor.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to consider one, two and three times whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And above all, where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
It certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is more a side for the teenager than a place for all viewers.
What will happen if the game is extended?
Well, when a dreamy room appears at the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend $9 billion and thus take over 21% of its capital, a innovation that is due to a strong fall in its stock exchange rate.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's staff at the single price of $25.25, resulting in a total amount of $3 billion.
The price adopted is below 19% of the price of the share of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure you a 10% profit and can be sold back at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley explained that global business is being done on the basis of a single average price of $29, that is, 28% above the current price value.
However, Morgan Stanley's action dropped by 6.79% to $23.07 by 17.00 GMT.
‘This strategic connection represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the status of a holding bank,’ said John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley accepted this status last week, which would allow him to expand their businesses to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Your connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to take a much more careful attitude than before.
The procedures presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed over the last few days: Last Monday Morgan simply declared that it would sell up to 20% of its shares for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
`A week ago', in Tokyo Tophosphoide Mizuno, managing director of the MUFG, stated, 'we thought that participation would consist entirely of tribal shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and protect ourselves.’
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% for its Morgan Stanley shares under its price value.
And the business will go with a reduction in profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into tribal shares if last mentioned items are exchanged at more than 50% over the sales value within a given period, i.e. at about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures MUFG funds will allow him to use investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a group press spokesperson refused to make more accurate information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to charge a payment rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that since the end of August, his balance sheet has been ‘significantly’ reduced.
The last few weeks were hard for the group that had to look at as their stock exchange rate declined by half, while the price for insurance for payment incapacitated to the level speed.
This price went back on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other ‘survivors’ of large investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, $15 billion, in part at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic around socialism of the 21st century was refounded.
This is the joint project of Venezolaner Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equator Rafael Correa.
That third one was the one who, following this Sunday, the example of his like-minded and friends, set the plan of a new constitution for election.
Mission fulfilled, for according to the public results of 80% of voters, 64% voted ‘yes’ in the popular vote.
According to these results, 28% agreed with `No', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order for the constitutional project to be adopted, a vote must be given more than half of all votes issued.
On Sunday, two polls and a count of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for `yes' at the exits of the electoral sites, and he prophesied 63% to 70%.
On the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa, by the way, had requested the victory of his constitutional project.
The `Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the equatarians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was welcomed by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election held in silence in accordance with the observational order of the Organization of the American States (OAS) referred to a text consisting of 444 points to ensure ‘new socialism’ for which the President is committed.
The constitutional project transfers the state violence to the economy by leaving it the sole right to ‘development planning’ in a country that lives far from oil promotion by foreign companies and by the foreign exchange that sends out refugees to the country.
The project, which is driven forward by the Correa elected in 2006, also grants the head of state more extensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to resolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will pursue a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and school education, which the president has already begun to introduce to this country of 13.9 million residents, in which 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also plans to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an equatorial base as a starting point for American antidrug use.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, held captive in the desert for 11 days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon healthy and unharmed.
In the morning, they were freed from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military terminal al-Maza right next to Cairo’s international airport at 15.30 a.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were brought directly without the press to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign neighborhood of Cairo, on board a helicopter to be investigated there.
They are pleased with all the ‘best health’ and the kidnappers ‘were not paid ransom money’, said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the Rollfield.
After being captured on 19 September at a terrain car safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly brought by 35 unknown kidnappers from one hiding next.
These are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizers of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from board two helicopters out at night, started the attack shortly before dawning in the morning.
‘On both sides, shots fell and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,’ said this controller, who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade where he is located, about the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
‘We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence service and from the special units,’ he said without further details.
He also argues that a ransom had been paid.
On the night before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a land car at a patrol, in which the kidnappers found themselves, of which they killed six, including the leaders from Chad, and two arrests.
The army declared that they were in association with a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, which, however, immediately objected.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is central to the current election campaign.
All the better.
But an area of our cultural life remains in forgetfulness.
Who will stand up and proclaim the terrible sums granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or the national historical sites that starve to starve?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no real laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides 3.5 million euros alone and only for the restoration of the Chinon castle in the Loire Valley?
In the constitution of their country, our American neighbors write that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all MPs and all administrative districts, in mutual voting.
In Quebec, in the association of Quebec’s history societies, at least 40,000 honorary officials gathered in 211 history societies strive to deal intensively with history, with a few groceries to save the numerous private archives, and to obtain the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments state-owned parts of the Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux States of the Belgian-Holiday Fortis Bank, which has been hit by the U.S. financial crisis in Turbulents, want to intervene under the arms: The three states provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the Banking and Insurance Institute, which, by the way, also has in Hungary branches.
On weekends, governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Officer of the Competition Authority, have consulted at the highest level.
In the Eurozone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions that are now being made in connection with the bank may have a precedent.
Within the meaning of the decision made on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank will probably sell some of its shares, all the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the fortis started a steep valley trip last week, in which the second half of the week already marked serious crisis scenarios.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a pleat.
The Institute’s securities fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year depth.
Since January, the value of shares has dropped by more than two-thirds.
In view of the current share rates, the market value of the group is EUR 14 billion, which, according to the management, is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion expensive U.S. rescue package and the resulting uncertainty on the markets are to blame for the valley ride of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Director-General of the Bank.
The monetary institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interest in a particular offer.
The Belgian government, however, was trying to calm down - no investor should sit down for his money, it said.
There has been no panic among the customers, the bank’s branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls lease companies their own.
Fuchs in the chicken stall
Because of a person’s drug consumption, life and health insurance in America often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
“There are data protection programs that link the use of the drug data to the consent of the data subject in any case.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the fox to the chickens - citing Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance sets the fees as well as the payout amounts in the event of damage depending on the health condition of the customer, and should the risk be taken too high, the insurance will not be completed at all.
Previously, the customer was sent to a medical examination, and the contract was only concluded in knowledge of the investigation results.
Ten years ago, Dick developed a much cheaper method: based on the customer’s identification number, he refers the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, says which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from which disease the customer suffers and how his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-reducing medications, then his blood fat levels would be untreatable high, which would automatically result in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplicator, so insurance needs to do more the paperwork, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for various purposes, such as against migraines and heat walls, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the point of view of the applicant, while the above mentioned is not.
For the query and processing of the data, separate societies have formed themselves that, before they relate to the data, ask the patient for his or her consent.
Meanwhile, they have to do so by law, even though abandons have not been recognized so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory studies and connect them with the data on drug consumption, giving them an even more accurate picture of the health condition of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
While there is a private data protection law for health data, its effect extends only to service providers in the health sector and insurance.
The bill has already been presented to Congress, according to which the authorities may also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the data subject.
Another question, of course, is that the data subject may not be able to prohibit access to his data, since the insurances otherwise do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are left quite a bit of the grace of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are both leading trading partners of each other, this was the main theme next to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French Indian summit is also taking place, mainly discussing cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
Although the European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging, democratic power that should be given more votes and co-language rights in international matters, the Member States have not yet been able to agree to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not answered at the 9th summit meeting in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU President of the Council Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double the trade over the next five years, i.e. to increase to €100 billion.
Given that the exchange of goods rose from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing Civil Aviation Agreements with India have also been legally merged into an agreement, so that air transport will also be flew in the future.
By 2009, India would like to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the package.
The goal is to create a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: While the Union is the partner number one in India, Neu-Delhi is only ranked nine among EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, both of which were condemned at the worst.
The Doha round should also be completed, with both sides being guilty of failure.
The EU stressed that it adheres to its energy and climate programme, that is, the pollution emissions are expected to be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed, as did the proposal to close a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The price increase in food should also be fought, so both support the invocation of an international conference on the topic of financial crisis.
Today, the chief of Indian government visits the French capital, where he is signed an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris it is hoped to be charged to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be decided on for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
Over 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the rights acquisition.
For the current event, the international Frankfurt Book Fair expects over 7,000 delegations from 101 countries. They will be distributed over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and will present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honor.
The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be the 264 sqm large exhibition room \"Punto Italia\".
This is followed by a press conference near the Room Structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the Book Fair: on this occasion, numbers, trends and perspectives around publishing are discussed in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers in the entire, but especially in the adult and youth spheres decreases.
The small plane of billionaire Steve Fossett disappeared a year ago
Steve Fossett’s small aircraft, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, on a flight over the Nevada desert, was discovered.
The individual parts have been found at a height of 3000 m, in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
In the interior of the plane, however, no human remains were found.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, fully disproved the last question during a press conference: “The plane has been located on which a troop was sent out. Now we have the assurance that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance.
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or its proximity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Transportation Safety (Ntsb) announced that a team was sent out on the plane a few hours after the plane was sighted, which identified the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on 3 September 2007, after Fossett launched a 3-hour flight in Yerrington, Nevada.
Yesterday was also found in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal items from a couple near her home at Mammoth Lakes.
This is two cards with the name Fossetts, both of which were issued by the Federal Aviation Administration by illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett was abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002, in the sixth round, the first human being to orbit the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he invaded the world in a single flight without a stopover with an airplane.
Among its numerous records, there is also an altitude flight of 15445 m above the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A suv, which falls through its original design and the special line guide, the exhausting surface and its clear angle from the traditional schemeta.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to instill new breath in the sector with this offroader.
Due to its exceptional properties, the idea of the Suv Glk will also fail unconventional, which will be seen from October 17 in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz.
Thus, the advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in new clothes, namely in the form of a 3D campaign - this is a novelty in the car sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in various phases, which will take the central shopping mile Milans, the Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear so apparently from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology of the new Glk, all its details are illuminated in different moments in order to put together again as a whole.
Without a doubt, Mercedes’s concern with this advertisement is to introduce a new kind of author advertising into this more stereotype field.
But will it be possible to stimulate the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto - now they are risking stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls for whom all of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the “Ultras Italia” group that has been traveling behind the Italian national team for years and which, honestly, has not caused serious problems until recently.
Never before have there been clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The promoters are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
There are other smaller groups of campaigns and apulia in Sofia.
They carry the Tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: they were removed on Saturday, however, to avoid identification.
Their examples are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, it came to conflict with a truly right radical fan scene, that of Levski.
The FIGC provided the Italian fans with 144 cards for the game: all were exposed to names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also controlled all the way through the Viminal: among those who traveled to Sofia, no one was in a running stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who had already been charged in this respect, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now, the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or the evictions identified Tifosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban preventing access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
Our Hooligans will no longer put one foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitaters who could follow these little more than 150.
“This fire must be immediately extinguished, and that in no way gives such behavior the possibility of justification,” it says from the Viminal.
That's why, \"Augen especially with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce -
In fact, in apulia there is a small core of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sport Supervision) gathers on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on part of the ice, i.e. the secret services dealing with the problem of stadium violence.
“Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during Mameli’s hymn? In Bulgaria, this is not a crime...”
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (evidently expressed in joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francesco Tagliente and on it Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of the Ultras Italia founded in 2002.
It is true, Mazzilli says it is not against the law to praise the duce in Bulgaria, but undoubtedly the behavior of these 150-200 people was a shame.
“I am not a socialist, adding the No. 1 of the Osservatorio, crimes are being committed in the land of their act.
So far, this group has been in the area, but now needs to be considered what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the peppers during the hymn mamelis: this is not a crime, but they allow me, but lack of education.
