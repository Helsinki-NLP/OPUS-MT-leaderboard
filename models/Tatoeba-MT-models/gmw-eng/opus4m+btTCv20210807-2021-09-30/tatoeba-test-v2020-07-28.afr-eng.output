On Saturday my father was open.
What he said made us angry.
He doesn’t speak French, he also speaks Spanish.
I don’t think any of you have ever noticed what you have done.
That's a nice couple of legs.
One, three, and five are uneven numbers.
Did they sign?
He needs water.
Birds drink water.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom never cooks.
How many pens do you have?
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk declared the Turkish Republic in 1922.
His silence surprised me.
It wasn’t worth the effort.
We arrived a little late.
No one is going to care.
Hello!
Are you sure you want me to help you with your homework?
The pack weighs more than one pound.
I know how you feel about him.
This will be our secret.
This pencil is white.
He watched some TV.
Drink!
Don't miss the opportunity.
This is a bit cool.
He is better than me.
Tom showed me his new guitar.
It is easy to view humans as unique among other living organisms.
The sick person had the best possible care.
You work too much.
We slept in the same room.
I'm not going to buy anything.
Tom wouldn’t be afraid to joke.
“I never thought about it,” said the old man.
Forget about them.
Tom didn’t want to die.
Mary is Tom's wife.
Where are the other girls?
Newspapers were not allowed inside.
I love cold pizza.
He didn’t wear a jacket.
He condemned racial discrimination as an egregation.
I drink water.
The food didn’t taste so bad.
She is two years older than you.
I never said that.
I don't blame you.
She was married to him.
If I were you, I would start immediately.
She has blond hair.
Does Tom know Mary?
I will be here when you come back.
When does Tom eat breakfast?
You have wine.
I forgot about him.
The horse is in the forest.
Another coffee, please.
Who is that woman?
Good. I will accept your offer.
Do you understand what he says?
My wife is a vegetarian.
Where does Tom eat breakfast?
We have carried out that plan.
You had to attend the meeting.
Can you read my letter and correct the mistakes if there is.
My mind hurts me.
Many houses have been washed away with the flood.
Why should I care about them?
Does your friend like tea?
I had to rent a car.
What should I do about her?
If a sickly thousand paper cranes fold, her wish will become true.
Tom has forgotten about them.
Don’t be late for the train.
If you find something you’re good at and what you enjoy, that’s a wonderful thing.
You wouldn’t believe me.
Tom won’t help us tomorrow.
I was sorry to hear from her.
Whatever you do, don’t let the new phone fall.
Why don’t you help me catch the birds?
It's not a joke.
Tom is not going to make any sales today.
The eye is the mirror of the soul.
The boy who writes best wins the prize.
Tom is not going to stay with us next week.
I work with this company.
Tom can’t swim.
You drink water.
She loved him.
Tom did not go.
Do you have a cell phone?
Do you know the boy crying?
Tom will help you.
A guy you don’t need.
Birds sing.
If the idiot would compete you would come second, because you are too deaf to come first.
I wouldn’t be surprised if Tom didn’t come.
I don’t want to remember.
Quickly!
They are in the library.
Tom didn’t do that.
She is very beautiful.
I don't want to meet her.
I don’t know where we will end up.
Tom stood up early.
This is life.
I couldn't stop Tom.
He didn’t feel sorry for me.
What is your favorite winter sport?
The girl in the blue jacket is my daughter.
Our teacher started singing a song well.
We can’t eat everything.
But you know well that these negative effects would have.
He will never believe me again.
Tom put his head in a flicker light.
The two towns were separated by a river.
We decided not to dismiss them.
Can I get a coffee for the road?
I met your girl.
Tom ate too much.
Do you know anything about them?
Where is the PowerPoint offer you promised me?
I drink tea.
I was sorry to hear from him.
I'll let you go back to work.
I'm not going to be bullied to do this.
Everything we can think of is real, but what is really real is the real question.
I live in Norway.
Tom is not allowed to die.
I won’t be able to help you.
No one tells me what to do.
The smallest continent is Australia.
Can you write an English letter?
My name is Tom. What is yours?
This is a reminder from Hokkaido.
I told you before, didn’t I?
Do not throw the dog with a stone.
This man was screaming for me!
Be more careful from now on.
Please go faster.
Where is the PowerPoint offer you promised me?
I don't want to lie.
The United States will one day elect a woman as president for the first time, and there will be joy over the long anticipated occasion.
Thank you so much! You just destroyed my life!
We will contact you when your table is ready.
Good morning.
This is my computer.
There are fifty members in this club.
I have received letters from a person I have never met.
My father's name is Fritz.
Do you speak French?
I am in a play.
Don’t believe everything people tell you.
I don’t speak French well enough.
I’m not going to be able to walk for a while.
I don’t want to be late.
There was a cat on the table.
It was a humid, rough summer day at the end of June.
Why would I lie?
Go in.
I am going back to my office.
I don’t speak Japanese.
I am also unemployed.
Can I get over later?
Tom was very tolerant.
I have to go.
Tom will not care.
Sami made it last week.
What should we do about him?
The food is right.
I put my socks in a tap.
Tom kept trying.
Tom won’t dare.
My horse is black.
If it is false, she is a liar.
I was worried about them.
My friend wrote me a letter to find out how I was.
I would like to post this package to Canada.
Why should Tom do this?
Don’t you add sugar?
I'm not scared easily.
She is doing her homework.
What shirt will you wear today’s school?
Berlin is the capital of Germany.
The walls were a light brown dye.
You are afraid of him.
Tom won’t see me.
I don’t think I should be so damned.
How many letters are there in the alphabet?
He is a man of faith.
Tom will not die.
I don't want to see you.
He's prejudiced jazz
When did you vote last?
She can answer your question.
Can I take a look at your card?
I wish you were close to me.
We think the reason for his success was hard work.
I saw you yesterday.
I see nothing.
Tom committed suicide by jumping off a bridge.
Dreams always come out differently.
Ping pong is also called table tennis.
I'm sure I'm not going to be of much help.
The air is blue, the sea is also blue. The air and the sea are blue.
Robert was so busy that he had to show an invitation to play golf by hand.
Tom is not going to wait so long.
He is my brother.
All human beings are born free, with equal dignity and rights. They have reason and conscience and should act in the spirit of brotherhood toward one another.
They are worried about her.
TV is more than the sunglasses.
You are the most beautiful girl in the world.
I have already been used to it.
Can you make me a copy?
What does he do here?
I am doing my homework.
Is it warm?
My house has two bedrooms.
Where is your luggage?
Who called this body to dance?
Can you turn off the lights?
He reads the paper every morning.
She kept working.
He is young.
Tom was busy.
Who built this ugly house?
He can’t speak much English.
I just wondered if you could find a place to stay.
I don’t want to change.
I always wondered what that smell was.
Tom is not going to stand up.
Martha is an excellent pianist.
Let's stick to that point.
The news spread quickly.
Do you have a fire?
Chinese food made the biggest impression in China.
Please make it go!
The dog jumped over the fence, into the garden.
Can I take a day off?
The warm bath relaxes my muscles.
Read this book.
Does he write letters in English?
We have a large garden.
Don’t waste your money by buying things you don’t need.
Good luck!
Tom told me to do it.
She has a house at the sea.
Have you ever been to Paris?
That's the last straw.
We know quite well.
Thank you very much!
She looked beautiful.
We all go.
Open your mouth!
It depends on the weather.
He doesn’t speak French, he also speaks Spanish.
I went back to my seat.
Close the door when you leave the room.
There is always something to do.
I'm going to be on the next bus.
Money cannot buy happiness.
Who said that? it's completely wrong.
Your name is first on the list.
Is it necessary?
Can you wait so long?
Have you been busy yesterday?
Sam hates to talk about money.
My sister is beautiful.
With the sun they left their jobs.
Who knows where Tom was born?
She ran.
The factory produces toys.
Did she hurt that cat?
He was a good king.
They said they have always done it.
We are looking for each other.
I just look.
Unfortunately, Tom will not be able to come.
Tom said he thought Mary was still living with her parents.
I'll have to come back to you.
Tom will stay for three days.
I wouldn’t be surprised.
This rain.
In the past, the boys were taught to defend themselves while they were still very young.
Tom would never have done that.
There is a bird here.
Wait, don't shoot!
I wouldn’t blame Tom.
This was her decision.
I didn’t really want to win.
I am not afraid anymore.
I hope we can become friends.
Tom is moving.
My grandfather made his own furniture.
He doesn’t like traveling by plane.
We really don’t have anything to lose.
Sam remained with a friend.
He asked my mother.
Does that make sense?
I don’t want you to change.
Even Tom was lying.
His music is known.
This is all joe.
He belongs to the Catholic faith.
I don’t want to go home.
I don't want to see you.
Tom was disturbed by the direction of his mind.
I’m not going to change my choice, no matter what you say.
Deacon is normal.
I love your son.
Tom is not going to show up at all.
I had to imagine myself.
Let's practice.
It was hard for him to hide his pride, which he felt after his success.
I want to know who broke this window.
Tom said he didn’t kiss Mary.
The clock is lukewarm.
I can’t get out of this cell.
I have no time for you.
They said they have always done it.
My boss was satisfied with what I did.
I am a friend of Robert.
I want to be her friend.
Do not move.
I heard from him.
Peter loves Jane.
I remember how I heard from her.
Tom wants to spend time with me.
I will be very careful.
This time, it was on the cinema.
Are you a girl or a boy?
Mike has two girls.
Let's wait until he comes.
His hair was dark brown.
That’s what you get!
Will Tom die?
A dog ran behind the cat.
I also kissed Tom.
Why don’t you join us for dinner tonight?
This is a horse.
Tom was in prison.
This is not a joke.
You promise you will come.
I would be happy to expect something like that.
Christmas Father lives in the North Pole.
I was born and raised in Tokyo.
I got cold.
Let's set off the television.
Unfortunately, I wouldn’t be a good company.
You won’t be able to help us.
You are the love of my life.
I'll take you out.
Tom drinks more than anyone I know.
I like to talk.
He doesn’t always have a son.
My son is a soldier.
I don’t want to hurt you.
Tom is looking for an easy way to lose weight.
Tom had to go.
I don’t have to sleep tonight.
I want to leave tom.
The song is easy to learn.
Where did you learn this?
You are stupid.
I completely forgot about them.
She chose to be pressured by her parents.
I have to help my mom.
He lives in a village near Osaka.
You're not a dog. Are you a cat?
What would you have done if you had been in my place?
I will be right behind you.
Tom went back to his car and got a flashlight.
I think I might be out of work.
I told Tom that I would be now.
My son still believes in Christmas Father.
I hate it to manage.
Sami has to wait a little.
Are they friends?
Tom knows everything about them.
It’s dangerous to go into that area on your own.
Sami didn’t notice this.
Are you wearing gloves?
Can I shake your hand?
You don’t know my dad, do you?
I’m back with freshness.
That's why I'm here.
He is my neighbor.
Tom thought it was unfair.
The hotel is looking out at the lake.
Tom’s hands were cold.
She is able to read.
It turns out that he knows the secret.
Do you have a cell phone?
Mr. Mitchel said that I overpaid the rest of the money before the end of the week.
She killed herself.
You are not a doctor.
I know how you feel about us.
She is younger than him.
I put it back where it belongs.
I take a book.
Tom lost his phone in the car.
I wouldn’t be so sure.
I still dream about her.
Tom didn’t wear socks.
Tom would say no.
I am a fireman.
There are islands in the sea.
Where's this now?
We are not hungry yet.
There is an easy solution to your problem.
I completely forgot about her.
We have to start doing this.
It is expensive to live in Japan.
I know how you feel about her.
I drank two cups of coffee.
I forgot about her.
Tom said it was unfair.
I don’t want to marry.
I care about him.
Tom may die.
If you stand up, he will be studying.
I have a dry skin.
We are his sons.
Birds are beautiful.
The fight lasted a week.
When did you laugh last?
Tom is not going to give a speech today.
Why did you join the army?
I wouldn’t blame you.
Flowers and trees need clean air and fresh water.
You are too late.
What we know about health has taught us through the study of diseases.
Tom is sitting at the window reading a book.
We’re not going to be here after 2:30.
I like to eat meat.
We could do it at 2:30.
He was jealous of my success.
Does Tom know how to dance?
Did you call him?
He kicked me!
She read the paper every morning.
The bakery is slow to the slaughter.
Please forgive me.
“Thank you, you are welcome.”
The food didn’t taste so bad at all.
I eat rice.
Excuse! May I open a window?
This wall is higher than that.
This rain.
Tom will be late.
I dare you to bridge the river.
I just bought a few shoes.
We want it back.
The game starts tomorrow.
They can overcome fear.
This cannot be a real diamond.
Tom walked away.
Was Tom there?
My father recently returned to Japan.
This is my friend.
I know how you feel about him.
Please share my umbrella.
Tom will win you.
Can you open this door?
Her story brings back memories of my parents.
Tom is no longer going to get help from Mary.
I’m trying to save myself so I can go to Australia.
I know everything about her.
I am to fall in love with you.
Tom and Mary are very busy.
It doesn’t matter what he says, don’t trust him.
You had to visit Kioto.
I got up when it was still dark.
Find out from everything you can about her.
I came to talk to you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God did not exist, we should have thought of him.
Can you help me with this?
We met in 2008. A year later, we got married.
She's not here.
He asked my mother.
Late in autumn, when the weather was rough, windy and wet and the cold could penetrate the thickest garment, especially on the sea, a poor boat with only two men entered the sea.
At night, all cats are big.
Stiller!
This is my house.
A bird flies.
He arrived for 30 minutes.
He went to an English-Japanese dictionary on the desk.
What a man does, he will also reap.
I wish you had said this before.
I love my mom.
Tom won’t object.
I am much bigger than you are.
Tom looked closer.
I am your father.
You will pay for it.
I have a place to stay.
Tom has a lot on his plate.
Do you choose red or white wine?
This is the next!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them?
We forgot about her.
Japan is full of beautiful cities. Kyoto and Nara, for example.
I will make it back for dinner.
I never thought it would be so easy.
Whose books are this?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat whatever you want.
It's really nice!
The river that flows through Parrys is called the Seine.
I'm glad you finally came back.
