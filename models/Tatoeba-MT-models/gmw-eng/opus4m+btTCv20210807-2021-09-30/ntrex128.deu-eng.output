Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
For some National Assembly members, the proposal to change its title to \"MWP\" (Mmber of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament) triggers a disillusionment.
The purpose is to change the name of the National Assembly to \"Welsh Parliament\" (Walsh Parliament).
National Assembly members of all political directions fear to become the target of the spot.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was concerned because the name “with Twp” and “Pwp” is imbued.”
For non-Walsish readers: In Welsh, \"twp\" stands for \"doof\" and \"pwp\" stands for \"Aa\"
A National Assembly member of the Plaid Cymru Party stated that the entire group was “not happy” and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was locked up with the name change, but pointed to the great similarity between \"MWP\" and \"Muppet\".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Board), which currently drafts a law on name changes, said: “The final decision on designations for the National Assembly members is of course with the members themselves,
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the body published the results of a public hearing on the proposals that gave wide support for the name Welsh Parliament for the National Assembly.
With regard to the title of the National Assembly members, the Welsh Parliament Members (Walisian Members of Parliament) or WMPs (WMPs) preferred the “MWP” option during a public hearing.
The National Assembly members seem to suggest alternative options, but ringing a consensus for President Elin Jones, who is to present a bill within weeks, might be a problem.
The Reforms Act will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on disqualification of National Assembly members and the design of the Committee system.
The National Assembly members can finally vote on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change to the country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether the name of their country should be changed to \"Republic of North Macedonia\".
The popular agreement was made to establish a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means that it raises its claim to the Greek territory, and has repeatedly expressed itself against its inclusion into the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the popular vote on the change of name, said he will not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change of the prize to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in view of the difficulties of churches in Harlem
“The old people with whom I spoke said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
“Today, both are no longer.
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“The social life of people looks different today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living quarters of the neighborhood in which people regularly find themselves.”
At the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets is not enough as long as the church leaders assume, and that they “will stand at the beginning sooner or later.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with property apartments where people live who do not support the remaining refuges.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy property in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore accelerate the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who enter these property apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community emerged in the 1930s.
A black church, which held its religious services nearby, became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem that refused to stop or support Black.
During a fire in 1939, the building was heavily damaged, but when Father Johnson’s community members planned the reconstruction, they commissioned the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's, proudly described the bell game as \"the bells of the poor.\"
The expert who aired the bell game in July used other words: \"A cultural treasure - and - an unparalleled historical instrument -
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was changed to the larger bell game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has taken place in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been drawn to some of the lay leaders of the Church and part of the diocese of Bishops.
In July, the Board of Directors, which consists of lay leaders, expressed in writing to the diocese that the diocese would attempt to pass costs on to the board of directors, although it had not been involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some community members complained about lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Hai hurts in California 13-year-olds when diving to praise stars
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, after official statements, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving after Lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s auxiliary screams and paddling with several others to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was happy to have caught a praiser, but then he realized that the boy was yelling “I have been bitten!
I've been bitten.\"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire key leg had been broken.
“I cried that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” he added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical state.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Dr. Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials locked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation purposes.
According to Giles, there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's attacks with cosmetics departments, which are owned by specialized assistants, boats, super-drugs and Debenhams.
In the context of a large-scale proposal to the 2.8 billion UK pounds of cosmetics market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow while fashion and household goods sales decline, the larger cosmetic departments will be tested in eleven branches nationwide. If they prove to be successful, they will be extended to other branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for opportunities to use shop areas previously used for television, microwaves and household goods elsewhere.
According to Sainsbury’s, for the first time, the scope of its cosmetics offer doubles to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Twezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Current series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more space and brand areas similar to those in stores such as boots.
In addition, the supermarket conducts a relaunch of its makeup series \"Boutique\", so that most of the products are vegan-friendly - an aspect that is increasingly required by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test in two Sainsbury’s branch offices. The first sales office was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and a second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local item stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to allow customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, sales sites will look increasingly like shopping houses as the supermarket chain with more services and non-food items is trying to fight off the discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has since bought the Argos and habitat chains two years ago in hundreds of branches of Argos sales sites and also set up a number of habitat sales sites, which has increased food sales as well as the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganise its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s, which ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from the branches of the drug dealer in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury’s sale of its 281 branch comprehensive pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million British pounds three years ago.
The company indicated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan when an extended range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, is added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: “We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetic departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand palette is tailored to all needs. Due to the enticing environment and the favorable locations, we are now an attractive target for cosmetics purchases that question the previous type of shopping -
Peter Jones - angry - after the withdrawal Holly Willoughbys from a business worth 11 million British pounds
“Dragons” The Star Peter Jones is “worstful” after TV moder Holly Willoughby retired from a business worth 11 million British pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The \"This Morning Moderator, 37, announced her withdrawal from Instagram.
Holly Willoughby hired “Dragons” the Star Peter Jones by their extremely short-term withdrawal from their lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on their own new connection agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is supposed to have been angry when the \"Golden Girl\" of television at a tense meeting on Tuesday in the center of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted to not be able to devote enough time to the joint homewear and accessories brand Truly due to their new business.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and would probably have doubled Willoughby’s estimated wealth of 11 million British pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly from Instagram, Jones left Britain on his way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said, “Truly had the highest priority for Holly with distance.
It should secure their future for them over the next few decades.
Your decision to withdraw came as a surprise to all stakeholders.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the launch of the market.
In Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold.
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the ‘This Morning’ Moderator, which is one of the UK’s most promising stars, could cost the company, due to high investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market launch millions.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a 40% share of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as a Moderator of the ITV broadcast I'm A Celebrity.
A Jones close source said last night, “We don’t comment on his business issues.”
Hard words, and then we fell in love.
He shrugged over the criticism he had received from the news media for a comment that some would consider “not presidential” and so expected positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said the voice of a news moderator is following:
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a major step towards decommissioning North Korea.
However, decontamination negotiations are in stock.
Over three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s top diplomat, said on Saturday against leading politicians from all over the world at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a “corresponding response” to North Korea’s first demolition measures.
Instead, he stated, the United States held sanctions that should keep pressure.
Trump showed himself significantly more optimistic in his customer speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of missile testing, support in the release of hostages and return of the mortal remnants of American military officials.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside and trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquakes ravaged an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population were displaced, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for international aid mobilisation.
“In many cases, leaders have made it very clear that they do not request international support, so that’s a bit difficult,” Summing said.
While Save the Children assembles a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesperson for the Disaster Protection Authority, said Indonesian officials had assessed the situation in Palu on whether international agencies should participate in aid measures.
In view of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still unfortunately poorly prepared for natural forces.
While these are built in Aceh Tsunami shelters, they are not a daily sight on other coastal beaches.
The apparently missing tsunami warning in Palu, despite a warning, probably contributed to the deaths.
Travel between Indonesia’s numerous islands is already a challenge in the best case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A Lazaret ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the location of the new disaster at the earliest in three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the hit Indonesian infrastructure to the core of his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
However, the Joko government of the next year's re-election suffers from funding deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure from persistent confession tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of people were displaced from their homes and homes, as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, arrows and arches and other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation battle against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool on Saturday at the London Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1 back level of his team at about 27 meters away from Chelsea gate.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot him in the direction of the rear pad.
The shot sailed high over the penalty room and drifted into the right upper corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I just tried to get myself into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I just tried to create as much time for myself as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw edge coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn’t think too much about it and just accepted the shot.
Chelsea led by the Belgian star Eden Hazard in half-time after a hit in the 25th minute.
The blues storm gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the midfield.
Then he shot a good piece pass, so Hazard got into the prison room.
Hazard left the defenders behind and ended the network with a left-wing shot to Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play at the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea is facing the UEFA Europa League videoton on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
Number of Tsunamis deaths in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of deaths of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as the Disaster Protection Authority announced on Sunday morning.
Many people are supposed to have been trapped in the ruins of buildings that had been brought to the fore by the earthquake of the strength 7.5 from Friday, which had caused up to six meters of high waves, according to the authority spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was overcrowded with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, for murder suspects after a woman is charged
After finding a woman’s body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was launched.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 pm with Stichwunden in Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder suspects.
Police urge residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in an early phase, but I ask all who have stopped near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I also ask all persons, in particular taxi drivers who may have taken something with a Dashcam to contact us, who may have information that is of greatest importance to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was living in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe the woman to know the place of action are found to inquire where she was found this morning.
The investigation was carried out, and the police told her that she was going to inform the victim's next members.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but was informed by police that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to enter the building.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that the entire area is now being treated as a place of action.
A woman appeared in tears resolved in the place of the event.
She repeats again and again, “that’s so frightening.”
At 14:00 a.m., two police vehicles were located inside the barrier and another vehicle was located before the shut down.
There were several police officers within the barrier who were monitoring the housing block.
People who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call number 101 or contact crime stoppers anonymously under number 0800 555 111 and refer to the protocol entry 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue before Parliament will be a new monument to the dispute over rewriting history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his recollection of the Taliban of the destruction of so many cultural and religious art products of England by its fanatic Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as \"torture - and \"seek to outline history\"
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on removing statues that Oliver Cromwell’s statue was aimed at the palace of Westminster.
The image tower in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would sacrifice for the deeds of his forefather Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure that is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than today, as someone who defended Parliament against outside pressure, in his case, of course by the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully appropriate representation is the subject of continuing history debates.
It is certain that the conflict has formed the subsequent development of our nation in the mid-17th century, and Cromwell is a single recognized figure that represents one side of this gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering them.
Killer Sweene bites Chinese peasants dead
According to local media reports, a farmer on a market in Southwestern China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man, to whom only the surname “Yuan” was named, was found dead with a separate artery of blood in the vicinity of a pig stall on the market in Liupanshui province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, is ready to inject pigs of vaccines.
He was reportedly travelling his cousin from Yunnan neighborhood on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pig stall was open.
He said in the stable there was a large male pig with blood on the snout.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilos heavy pig had killed the farmer.
“The legs of my cousin were bloody and mutilated, the cousin to whom the last name “Wu” was cited by the Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent attacks on other people while police were collecting evidence at the site.
Yuan's family and market authorities, according to reports, negotiate a compensation for his death.
It is rare for pigs to attack people, but such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290 kilos heavy pig knocked in a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer’s wife was able to hide the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “emotion.”
“You’re just playing.
They like to gnaw and are very curious, ... they're not going to hurt someone.
You only have to treat them with the right degree of respect, he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rain to the Southwestern United States
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening along the way over the colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods in North Mexico and the Southwestern United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. Eastern coastal time, Rosa wind speeds of 136 km/h showed up, which corresponds to a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Pacific is beginning to form a trough that moves east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical moisture is transported north to the south-east of the United States.
Rosa will release up to 25 centimeters in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, tropical moisture is generated by interactions with the attracting trough that has caused widespread heavy rainfall in the south-west.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimetres can cause dangerous floods, floods in the water, and possibly floods in the desert.
High tropical moisture, in turn, leads to reduction rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimetres per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-east, particularly in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters are expected.
Due to the spread of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of fluttering floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In view of the impending tropical rainfall, it is urgent to avoid going on foot into the desert.
Strong precipitations can cause canyons to become tearing streams, and thunderstorms bring local wind forests as well as wind that leads dust with them.
The nearby trough brings local heavy rain in parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total amounts of precipitation may be above one centimeter, which can lead to a small range of shots in the water and smooth rideways.
This would be the first precipitation of the rainy season in this region.
The first isolated tropical rainshowers reach Arizona on Sunday evenings and Monday mornings. On Monday evenings and Tuesdays it will rain widely.
On Tuesday, strong rains spread into the Four-Corners region and will continue Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States as the Arctic cools down while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, in the middle of the US, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the ongoing summer heat tries to redevelopment and expand.
For much of the middle and east of the U.S., a warm October start with widespread temperatures is expected at 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the North East.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the United States.
More than 20 million viewers have seen the hearings of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million viewers saw on Thursday six television networks the touching statements of the board named Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assaults in the 1980s.
On Friday, the television station interrupted its regular program due to a last minute turn: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, which is intended to carry out a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate’s Justice Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, pressured them and tried to remove their clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he is 100% sure that this has not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen saw the hearing.
The company determined the average viewer numbers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring viewer numbers in offices.
To turn this into the right perspective: this corresponds to, for example, the viewer numbers at a play-off football game or at the Oscar ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support Kavanaugh’s nomination, recorded the highest numbers of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC came second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had released a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by cameras from CNN and CBS, as protesters pressured him in the chair on the way to a hearing of the judicial committee.
The scene was broadcast live at CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” a woman said.
“Do you believe that he is telling the country the truth?”
“They have power, while so many women are powerless,” a woman said.
Flake said his office released a statement and complemented it before the chair concluded that he would have more to say in the hearing before the committee.
All cable and broadcasting networks sent live hours later, when the Judicial Committee was to vote on the transfer of the Nomination Kavanaughs to the entire Senate.
Flake, however, said he would only do this under the condition that the FBI, as of the democratic minority, ask for the charges against the candidate the next week.
Flake is partly convinced by conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flakes' decision was of great importance as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes for the confirmation of Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation of the charges raised against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with Sunday Times newspaper, accused critics of their plans for the exit from the European Union to use the future of Britain for political purposes and undermine the interests of the nation.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the party day of the Conservative Party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In a next interview with her on the title page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on their so-called Chequers plan for Brexit by calling a proposal that would drive each other’s duties through the UK and the EU as “full absurd.”
Deadly shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shots at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested by Baton Rouge for murder.
The authority released video footage of the dispute between Sims and Simpson, according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reports, the police secured the glasses at the site and said that at Simpson's glasses DNA was found.
After a survey of Simpsons, the police said he had been on the death-dealing shots.
The lawyer reported that the bail was set to $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound on the neck.
The police are grateful to the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Federal Police's criminal technical laboratory, Southern University Police and the local citizens for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional executive authority for “their care and their pursuit of justice”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-foot-tall winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
In the last season he reached an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU’s basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “deeply shaken” over Waydes’ death and “stand under shock”
“You’re always afraid of such a thing,” Wade said.
Vulcan spits ash in Mexico City.
The southern quarter of the Mexican capital has been reached from the Volcano Popocatepetl.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater increased and 183 emissions of gas and ash were registered within 24 hours.
The authority monitored numerous cases of grotesque and shocks.
Images in social media showed thin ash layers on the windscreens of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists, since September 2017, have rocked an earthquake of the strength of 7.1 Central Mexico, increasing activity on the 72 kilometres southeast of the capital volcano.
The volcano known as “Don Goyo” has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six persons were arrested on Saturday following clashes between the willing police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by the willing police, cast them with eggs and also sluggished color powder, so that dark dust clouds were created in the usually populated streets.
In the course of the day, there were also hand-in-hand contact with the police, who used their punches to stop the fights.
For several hours, pro-independence groups — no forgetfulness, no forgiveness — while facing Unionists who called “Long live Spain.”
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered in the protests.
However, a year after the October 1 referendum, which was seen as illegal by Madrid, was celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had decided with overwhelming majority for independence, although the vote was low, as the split-off opponents mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent vote in violent clashes before the polls.
Pro-Independence groups had been camping outdoors on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in separatist protest, said he saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out for joy because they could choose, but now we're hanging, he said.
Despite an important, though narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties of this year had difficulty maintaining the movement. Many of their most well-known leaders are either in self-exile or in prison, where they wait for their procedures due to their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in investigation since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for election to the European Parliament next year.
“As a candidate for the European election, the best way to promote the degradation of democratic values and the oppression by the Spanish government is,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house had been rammed by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry was repeatedly rammed by a car.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 a.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, an armbrush may have been shot at the car.
Menga target means for Livingston 1:0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengas' first gate for Livingston secured the victory.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas Meeter proved to be a crucial reason that Gary Holt's team could join Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team will remain in the premiership this season without a side-by-side win and will face the hearts that are eight points behind the next Sunday.
Previously, the Rangers were hosts to Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston can in the meantime increase his winning series in the division to six games, that is, head coach Holt has not had any defeat since his acquisition of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against freely playing guests
Holt’s team had to be in charge for a long time, as its direction put the Rangers in the face of a wide range of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but got slower before the gate, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he was out of control to pass Craig Halkett's head shot at the gate.
The hosts were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could hinder guests in standard situations.
In this way, the crucial gate came into being.
The Rangers allowed a release, and Livingston prepared a chance when Declan Gallagher and Robinson shared Menga in the shooting position, shooting the gate with a ball contact from the middle of the prison room.
At this stage the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but were unable to overcome the host's defence, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unheld.
This pattern continued in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was fired by the Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow pulled the ball over from a different standard situation of Livingston.
Flanken again and again entered the Livingston penitentiary and were regularly brought out of the danger zone, while two required criminal offenses — one from Halkett against the replaced Glenn Middleton and one from hand-playing — were refused.
\"Phenomenal - by Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were unparalleled and exceeded expectations in this upward trend.
Her play mode and team have hardly changed since her return to the top teams, but Holt has been paying great praise for the way in which he has awakened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellent organized defence, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall held on to Trab throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as being under Gerrard for a while, they could not reach this standard.
Her last ball was inadequate - only once they were able to penetrate the host team - and that's something like a wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), smiling faces and blue sky prevailed when the head of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police called security reasons for keeping a 25,000 people strong from meeting in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators — many of them Kurds — also listened. They condemned Erdogan’s policies as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him in the country.
The opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and beautified by others as a autocrat.
Transport accident in Deptford: biker dies in collision with car
In the event of a collision with a car, a cyclist was killed in London.
The collapse took place at about 10:15 a.m. British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic-rich road in Deptford in the south-east of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and Sanitiers took care of the man, who died at the accident site.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had been killed in an accident with driver fleeing in Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from the accident from Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and notify his closest members.
Roadblocks and redirects for buses are set up, and the driver has been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six officials injured in riots
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in riots in a high-security prison for men.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 p.m. British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and still hold on.
Specialized \"Tornado\" officials have been drawn to end the unrest that eight inmates are involved in and are limited to a wing.
The officials were treated on site for minor injuries in the face.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “It was used specifically trained prison personnel to fix an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that the police officers will be handed over and perhaps spend a long time behind bars.
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisons, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director was treated by a criminal in the hospital after an attack.
In October last year, prison officials were called to the prison to deal with severe unrest in which the staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with floodwaters (drier areas may benefit)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week, when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the deserted southwest and bring with them the risk of fluttering flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about floods on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada as well as to the southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on Monday night and move directly across Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed in a tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have come close as tropical storms or tropical depression Phoenix up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometres of Arizona’s border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center forecast 5 to 10 centimeters with a single up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the south-east characterized by deserts, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely to be and separates up to 10 centimeters in total.
For those who do not have the risk of flooding, the rainfall associated with Rosa may be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although flooding is a major concern, this rain is likely to be useful in part because in the south-east there is currently drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, in slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona, at least extreme drought occurs, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
First, the hurricane’s path means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and is located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder waters and weaken.
It is therefore expected that Rosa will meet on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on land.
The precipitation can fall heavily in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant flood risk.
“From Baja California to the north-west of the Sonora Desert, precipitation rates are expected from 7.5 to 15 centimetres, with up to 25 centimeters possible — reported weather.com.
Afterwards, as a tropical storm in the north, Rosa will move across Mexico, reach the border to Arizona on early Tuesday morning as tropical depression, and then move through Arizona to the south of Utah until late Tuesday evening.
“As a major threat, in connection with Rosa or her remnants, very strong rainfalls are expected in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert, and the southeast of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
As a result of these precipitations, life-threatening floods of floods and shootings in the water are expected in the desert and in mountainous areas of the earth.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murders
After finding a 16-year-old with a stroke in Somerset, three boys in the teens and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the suspicion of attempted murder.
The teen was found injured on Saturday at 4:00 p.m. British summer time in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is “stable”
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked all who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered “under the kindness, the anger,” of the Democrats.
“A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unspeakable and unheard tactics of Democrats,” Trump said at a poll in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the Democrats during the entire nomination process, among the common people, the anger.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh said before Congress and dismissed the charge raised by Christine Blasey Ford, he sexually harassed them decades ago when both were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford also said that he was indicted.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with excellent balance sheet in service to the generality,” he said to the crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The President was referring indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the interim elections.
Five weeks ago, one of the most important choices in our lives.
I did not act, but in reality I did,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats are seizing their mission of \"resistance and blocking\"
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination will likely take place in the Senate at the latest on Friday, a high employee of the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, victims rise
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were fluctuated, as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, huge waves hit the beaches.
Hundreds of people came together at a feast on the beach of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the beach, destroying many people and destroying everything they were on their way.
The tsunami was an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the threat came up yesterday by the tsunami, people were still on the beach and didn’t immediately run away from it, and they fell victim to it,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the Indonesian disaster protection agency BNBB at a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come by itself, it swung cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami had been pulled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before meeting on the coast.
Some people were on the run from the tsunami and had survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial recordings published by the Disaster Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, congested and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake series was to be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian agency BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that, during the massive earthquake of Friday, the energy released was equivalent to the 200-ft of energy from the nuclear bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have increased, the authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as “indeed,” and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
According to his information, the bodies of some victims were found under the debris of collapsed buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and the damage might have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed in words Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a Red Cross statement, there are more than 300,000 people living there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the authority was repeatedly criticized for not knowing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves were reportedly entering at the time of the warning.
In social media, amateur recordings show a man on the upper floor of a building who desperately warns people on the street under him from the nearby tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall forces on the shore and swims buildings and cars from it.
Reuters could not check the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The quake and tsunami caused a massive power failure, which interrupted the communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send freight aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuaters still need urgent food and other life-threatening goods.
The city’s airport will remain closed until October and will be reopened only for aid measures.
For Sunday, a visit was planned by President Joko Widodo in Evacuation Centers in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the employees are accommodated in tent dwellings in the courtyard of their office, but, according to words, Dosebas came across on the scene of desolation.
“They told me they had seen numerous destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the relief groups began the hard task of putting disaster relief into action, some mounted that expert foreign helpers would be prevented on the trip to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial aid, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible if the site of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened until now.
“At the moment, it’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘okay, that’s a national disaster,’ we can accept international support.
During the second night since the earthquake and tsunami from Friday to Palu, friends and family members hoped that they would miss out on one of the wonders that shed light on the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of a wastewater channel.
On Sunday, rescue forces released a woman who had been clumsy for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the beginning of this month in Indonesia to end Asian Games.
Others of those in Roa-Roa-Hotel were prisoners, as Mandagi complemented, his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have to bear my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel under the paragliders made the round, WhatsApp sent messages to the Palu contestants who participated in the beach festival.
His news, however, led, rather than to blue hooks, only to grey question marks.
“I think this means that the news was not sent,” he said.
Thief steals $26,750 while working on a slot machine in Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport police press release, on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee Thieves, a Brink’s employee stole $26,750 when filling a slot machine.
The driver of the vehicle had learned a slot machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to send more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man came running behind Brink’s employee,” and stole a sack full of money intended for the automatic.
According to the press release, the Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but the police did not state how many people were involved in the incident.
People who have information about the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport Police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name to Ye.
When announcing the change to Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West (the officially known being Kanye West).
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used him as the title of his eight album released in June.
The change is due to his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album, Yandhi, is expected.
He appears in the broadcast as a substitute for singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has refused for “emotional reasons.”
The word is not only an abbreviation of its current professional name, but, according to its own statement, it has a religious significance for West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,’ West said in a conversation this year about his album with Radio Moderator Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am we.
From Kanye, which means “the only one,” only “Ye” became simply a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, of everything.
The album is more likely to reflect what we are.
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has also written his name with and without a tie and large letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military violence against the civilian population, during the 50th anniversary of the bloody repressions against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, \"never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.\"
On October 2, 1968, soldiers set fire to a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people. At that time, left-wing students' movements were set up throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans through monthly assistance for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of training provided young people with criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence
Given China’s enhanced activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on research in this field, says investor and AI practitioners Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements of various areas of the U.S. government, even though the U.S. is generally lacking a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China proposed its plan last year: The country plans to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
“The doubled budget for AI research would be a good start in view of the fact that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., we are looking for the next AI outbreak,” Lee said.
Duplicate financial resources could double the chances that the next big AI success would be achieved in the United States, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on a AI system that defeated the highest-placed American Othello player, and later was the leading leader at Microsoft Research and President of the Google Lowest in China.
Lee honored former U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked for the date of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Read Words, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
“Neither China takes away the academic leading forces, but the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have set up coryphas from universities to work on AI.
According to Read, a changed U.S. immigration policy for the AI efforts of the U.S. could also be beneficial.
“I think that in the territory of AI, people promoted should be offered Greencards automatically,” he said.
China’s State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan) in July 2017.
According to Read Words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations funds to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to be a partner in industry and science, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month’s investment of $2 billion in the “AI Next” initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is investing more than $100 million annually in AI research.
In the meantime, U.S. legislation on the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has done nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change to the country name
The population of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to \"Republic of North Macedonia\" and this measure would set up a decade-old dispute with Greece that blocked the application of Macedonia for inclusion into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that it raises its claim to the Greek territory, which is why Greece has filed a veto against the capture of Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name. However, nationalist opponents argue that the amendment would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign is in doubt that the electoral action will reach the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was, “Are you a member of NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the change of name, to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev belongs, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, admission into organisations such as the EU and NATO is worth the prize.
“I have come today to vote for the country’s future, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union’s umbrella, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the voting result is not legally binding, many members of Parliament have said they would hold on to the result so that it is crucial.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said there had been no reports of irregularity by 13:00 p.m.
However, the election was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
“I’m here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe,” said G Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital city of Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their vote in Strumica, Macedonia, on the amendment of the country name that Macedonia would open the way to joining NATO and the European Union.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, presented a small stage and presented chairs to tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join raised heads, not through the back entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn others like China and Russia into part of the integration between Europe and Asia.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in urgent investment for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe a large majority will be for this, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are EU and NATO,” Zaev said after his vote.
According to his words, a “yes” result would be a “confirmation of our future”
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the referendum. This number is below the required electoral participation.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote with “Yes”.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the election decision must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first severe blow to the politics of the pro-Western government since its takeover of power last May.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvered through the entire Brighton defence to reach Tor
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crossed the Brighton defence of Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his hit look funny in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine attacker received a pass in the midfield.
He raced between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then took over several more defenders at the edge of Brighton's penalty room.
Then he shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty room to play the ball back to Aguero, who crossed his right-hand shoe Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan and shot into the right side of the network.
“Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet,” said Pep Guardiola, City Manager, to reporters.
“We had talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he had reached a gate at this moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League dual.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball at this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net shortly before he pulled it out.
City will play in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants the Rockies to destroy the game
Since the Nationals have been expelled from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force a further commitment.
However, the always-powerful skier hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday, but only if this is relevant to the Rockies, who in the NL West have a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the playoffs.
The Rockies achieved at least one wildcard with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday evening, but still wanted to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can throw at least because we know the atmosphere here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why should I not take part in this competition?
The Nationals have not announced any start players for Sunday, but, according to reports, they are inclined to throw shearers into such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starting player, practiced in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander has a 18-7 statistics this season, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is holding off announcement in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation in connection with the board Kavanaugh elected by him for the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks ago, one of the most important choices in our lives.
That's one of the big, big ones - I'm not acting, but in reality I'm going on, so I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means, they see the kindness, the abominability.
It is no matter who hurts them, who they have to cross to gain power and control, that is what they want, power and control, we will not give them.
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission in “resistance and blocking.”
“And you see that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “wrongly and indecently and deviously and dishonestly.”
He named himself the highest Democrat in the Senate’s Justice Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which sparked loud calls from the public.
“Do you remember their answer?
Did you let the document go out?
Oh, yeah, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for you one - that was a really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen -
Labour no longer has all opinions.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to call me, this was not surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour deputies to say that they are not welcome - just because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly, as she had gathered energetically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the tadel application for having left a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues, on Jeremy with previous top politicians was not an opinion.
The announcement of the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday said that “the meetings should all be included and productive.”
Most of the Friday evening GC sessions in my eight years as a local Labour deputy were exactly that.
Today, most meetings are unfortunately not marked by this tone, and the promised “friendly, more cautious” policy has long been forgotten if it has ever started.
It becomes more and more clear that differing views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that every opinion is based on whether it is accepted by the party peak.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader of the Party, and colleagues with whom I previously believed to share similar political views now expected me to take a turn and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with — whether with regard to national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly, with no role to play in what I say, a chimpftirad follows in the social media, calling for my election, calling for political center and saying that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience I am not alone.
In fact, I know that it is better for me than some of my colleagues, since the comments directed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of the colleagues, who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, yet never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn urged the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance last week.
In fact, we no longer allow all opinions to be applied, and with every distrust aid and any change to the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to pull my head and not express my opinion so clearly. Then I would have “no problems”
But I did not go to politics.
Since I was a student 32 years ago, prompted by the neglect of the Thatcher government, due to which my classroom in the entire school literally disbanded, the Labour Party, I have been working for better public services for those who need them most urgently, as a community council as well as as as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a hell out of my political views, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be unclear about my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
In view of the fact that the country will be on a Brexit, which will damage households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, however, I am directing this message not to Nottingham momentum, but to my electorate, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many electoral threats or political intentions will not stop me from acting in my opinion best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only one of the 10 teams on top of the table.
Finally, the success of the home team was due to their superior defence as well as to their better chance gain, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We have been put to the test so far in our games, and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: \"Recognition for Ayr, they've used their chances better than we do -
Grant Anderson tried in the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released from the Warriors, Melrose was able to speak the numbers, and Jason Baggot started an unhighened attempt.
Climo built Ayr's leadership with a penalty strike before reaching a hit right at half time and then in the all-in-way he made an increased attempt, so that it stood for Ayr for Ayr for the break 17:5.
Melrose began the second half, however, well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, raised by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Afterwards, due to a severe injury from Ruaridh Knott, which was carried from the field of play, Ayr built his lead by a climo-enhancing attempt by Stafford McDowall.
Then, as captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and at the end of a phase, Melrose was allowed to pay the additional man by an unexplained attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for Tackling without Ball against Climo, MacPherson got a touchdown from the penalty-dealing gas behind the forward Ayr package.
Climo increased almost since the breakup after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's boxkick and sent flank player Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the home team.
“Still Game”Star seems ready for new career in gastronomy
“Still Game”Star Ford Kieran appears to be ready for a change into the guest business after it turned out that he was appointed as managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, whose screenplay he writes and in which he plays one of the lead roles together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the broadcast, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official entries, he is the managing director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of the Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow’s “floring restaurant business.”
“The sea belongs to us: The Bolivia included by land hopes that a court will open the way to the Pacific
Matroses patrol in front of the naval headquarters decorated with dewwork in La Paz.
There is a blue flag in public buildings.
Fleet variables from the Titicacase to the Amazon carry the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
Getting it back is a duty.
Everywhere in Bolivia included in the country, the memory of the coastal section lost to Chile in a bloody conflict for 19th century resources is as alive as the desire to drive back across the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a ruling by the International Court of Justice to be held on October 1 after five years of consultation.
“Bolivia has the swing, a spirit of unity and laziness and expects the result to be of course with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the IGH’s judgment on large screens, hoping that the Court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s demand, according to which, after decades of sporadic talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate on sovereign access to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s Charismatic Indigenous President, who is facing a controversial battle for his re-election next year, the judgment on Monday is also at stake.
“We are about to return to the Pacific,” he praised the end of August.
However, some analysts hold it unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bosnia and believe that this would change little.
The UN, based in the Netherlands, is not authorized to address Chilean territory, and has determined that it will not decide on the result of possible talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, the case was “not complicated.”
Far from supporting Bolivia’s case, the last four years could also mean a setback.
“The current Bolivian government has caught up with the question of access to the sea,” Zárate said.
She pointed out that Morales' wary rhetoric has choked any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their conversations at some point, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, expressed the view that the court’s decision had been an unusually fast one.
On Monday, Bolivia has \"an extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile - and a chance to end the 139 years of disputes for mutual advantage\" he said.
Calzadilla also argues that morals, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, use the sea’s theme as a political cross.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access to the Pacific,” he added.
“The judgment is a chance to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says atomic degradation takes place only if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never first destroy their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the head of state of the rivals in Singapore.
His statements come at a time when U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to have been in action shortly after the summit with North Korean head of state Kim Jong-un in Singapore, re-entering the established nuclear diplomacy.
Ri referred to the idea that further sanctions and US resistance against a declaration to end the Korean War would ever force the North into the knee, as \"hiring pain.\"
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the statement, without Pyongyang taking essential steps first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang seriously believes it to be the absence of an arsenal in which the country is likely to see the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang for next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge head coverings that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or fully shield the sun, you no longer need to search.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy oversized head coverings for their summer collection 2019, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
In this summer, Instagram has flooded the most unpractical hats, and these designers have sent their up-to-date creations across the runway.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige-colored hat with a spring-like wide edge that just pushed the heads of the models.
As other over-dimensional accessories, watermelons, a magic hat, and even an ananas were occupied with jewels, but these are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a number of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks were decorated lips and had more similarity to Hannibal Lecter than to Haute Couture.
A creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkel and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to set another huge fashion statement, you are lucky.
Mode observers predict that the huge head coverings could find their way into shopping streets near you.
The over-dimensional hats follow directly on “La Bomba” the straw hat with 60 centimeters wide edge, all of which carry from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpractical hat, which hit big waves in the social media, sent another great creation across the runway: a beach bag of straw, which was almost as big as the bathroom-dressing model that held the bag.
The bass bag in red orange with bast French and a white leather arm was the most outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer flower collection “La Riviera” at the Paris fashion week.
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets for next summer. The designer has so excited so much to see that the demand for over-dimensional accessories will hardly be ignored.
John Edward: Language skills for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be characterized by academic excellence, which in 2018 has continued with further outstanding exam results and is only supported by individual and joint successes in the fields of sports, art, music and other community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to take care of their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “Speak to someone in a language he understands, so you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.
This is an impressive reminder that we can’t just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
The current test results of this year show that languages with the highest levels of existence are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved Note A in the higher examinations.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools revealed that 72 percent of the students in Mandarin received the Note A in the higher exams, while 72 percent of students who learned German received 69 percent of the students who learned French, and 63 percent of students who learned Spanish also achieved Note A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages today are regarded as choice subjects as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculums of independent schools and at other locations.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons employers called for the problems of occupying open positions were related to a lack of language knowledge.
As a result, language skills are increasingly required when preparing young people for their future job.
As more and more open places require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage through such a lifelong ability in the future.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilinguals will automatically provide a lead in front of competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct entertainment, and French was spoken as the only language of a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for today’s children that we now invest in language education.
Children speaking several languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will be taught that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests lie, a number of languages with correspondingly specialized teachers will always be available at independent schools.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, no matter what the future looks like.
At this time in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance to the future of the country, which is why this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered to be “International communication capability”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this option, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent School.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James join the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, waiting soon has an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening game of the previous season.
How many minutes he will play, however, is not yet fixed.
\"There will be more than one and less than 48,\" Walton said on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for just a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week, James was asked for training for his plans for the six games' comprehensive pre-season game plan of Lakers.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare me,” he said.
Time for Trump's announcement in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of election campaign announcements this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five scheduled for the next week, including in well-deserved places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the swivel vote on the confirmation of his election for the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections in November, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress.
When will Trump’s announcement take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you view online?
Trump's announcement in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast time).
You can track Trump’s announcement in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address the hearings of the Kavanaugh board nominated for the Supreme Court for charges of sexual misconduct, which were conducted in tense atmosphere this week, and the expected Senate vote on the confirmation will remain in swing for up to a week, while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this series is to support Republicans who have to make difficult choices in November.
Therefore, President Trump’s election campaign team told Reuters that these five announcements will serve to mobilize volunteers and supporters next week while Republicans are trying to keep and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives.
“Control over Congress is so important to its plans that the President will travel in as many states as possible while the operational election campaign season is nearing,” said a Trump election spokesman who did not want to name it to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could participate in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling for tonight and report media from Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
The visit on Saturday is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidate in polls from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to drive him up in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows combat readiness to maintain hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four-parties may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed on Saturday afternoon.
As a sports concept, the swinging pendle of momentum is a pure invention, but one that the players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So where is the moment in her opinion now?
“They were in leadership with six points, and now it’s four, so I think that’s a little momentum for us,” Jordan Spieth said when leaving the venue.
Europe, of course, is in favour and is four points ahead, while 12 more follow.
However, according to Spieth, Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and can each present three out of four points.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the drop to the green and goes ahead with a good example.
The thunderural enthusiasm cries became louder over the course of his round, when he lowered an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them after he and Thomas had left after two holes with two points.
His putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for them, triggered a similar cry that suggests that the American team is not out of play yet.
“I really have to cut myself and take care of my own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have achieved more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days and have undoubtedly written the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s uneven but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and can do nothing wrong.
\"Moliwood\" was not the only couple who had not hit Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also had avoided Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the apparently between them and the outflowing amount of flow of energy underlies that they are the players to beat it on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who, in the fall of the sun, beat a possible European win over Le Golf National.
Both are preferably at the same time at different holes.
Speaking of European fame, however, would be slow.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short trial with Sergio Garcia, the fourth hero of the morning, who played alongside Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spanish and Sweden into a clamp that they could not overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the glue.
The four and four pairs are as fascinating as possible due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or do not give, and the way in which a strategy can change rapidly.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are in the lead on the last day, but this fourth round has also shown that the U.S. team is ready for battle, which some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe will go on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6 in leadership
After the four-and-four-parties of Saturday against the United States, Europe is at 10:6 am and will lead with a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two wins over the hard-hitting Tiger Woods and was able to score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to win back the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated in the fourth in the morning against the erring American team and won the series at 3:1.
In the four-parties, the U.S. made more resistance and won two matches, but were unable to pick up the resistance.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the 12 on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four points as the first European newcomer, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend’s Molliwood, only won four points as a second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After they had beaten Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourths, they teamed up with the enchanted Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more detailed 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged through two matches on Saturday, occasionally flashed his brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and sevens.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the fourth in the morning, returned and played as a partner of Henrik Stenson, winning 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day south-west of Paris, not everything went according to their ideas.
The three-time Major-winning Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the measure for Americans with two points on Saturday.
In the fourths, they achieved a 2&1 win over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter playing for Spain and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-part 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it was only twice that a team came back after it went into the single with a back of four points. As a title holder, however, for Furyk's team, there is a disagreement to keep the trophy.
After two days only in second place, it doesn’t look as if they could launch a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects one-sided demolition without confidence
North Korea’s Foreign Minister said on Saturday before the United Nations that continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and that under these circumstances, the country would not, in any way, give up its nuclear weapons on one side.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea has taken essential measures last year, for example, it has stopped nuclear and missile testing, devolves nuclear testing, and is committed not to increase nuclear weapons and technologies.
“We don’t see any response from the United States, however,” he said.
\"Without trust in the United States there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not, at least, first-hand, rob ourselves of our trust.\"
While Ri trusted North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phase-wise” approach to decontamination, in which North Korea would reward successive steps, his statement seemed significant, as it did in the past, when it did not reject one-sided decontamination from the outset, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit meeting between an official U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, in which Kim was assured to work on the \"Determinization of the Korean Peninsula\", while Trump pledged guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is pursuing an official end to the Korean War that took place from 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said Pyongyang had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
In addition, Washington opposes demands for a lockdown of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. is on “first determinization” and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and is even opposed to the “explaination of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into the knee is a brain pain of those who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust -
Ri did not enter plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had highlighted at the United Nations in the beginning of the week.
Instead, at three meetings between Kim and South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months, the Minister added: “If South Korea were the other party in the de-termination issue instead of the United States, it would not have come to this halt in de-termination of the Korean peninsula.
However, the tone of Ris’ speech is very different from his speech last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea’s missiles on the mainland of the United States after “the evil president, Trump Kim, was called “a rocket man” on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened North Korea’s “full destruction” last year, praised Kim for his courage with regard to demolition steps, but he said that there was still much work to be done and the sanctions to decommission North Korea had to remain in force.
On Wednesday, Trump said he has no time frame for it: \"whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter.\"
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, however, said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must definitely continue energetically until we have achieved the complete, final and verified decomposition.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to finance Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he will visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, he said on his departure from Pyongyang that progress had been made, only to be accused by North Korea hours later, he has put “gangster-like demands”.
North Korea vowed to build a rocket base and a nuclear complex this month at a meeting with Moon when the United States takes \"compliant measures\".
He said Kim had told him that the “responsive measures” were security guarantees that Trump had given in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep this year’s primary study, a measure against the spreading macho culture to keep awake with caffeine and learn all night.
A scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unneeded when it comes to paying attention to themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is in his opinion the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to call the course into life after giving a talk on the effects of sleep withdrawal on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I know about it now, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is, and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
This year’s first course explained to the students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said the university chose to introduce the course after she found that students had suffered from severe sleep withdrawal during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, the students see the picture of a room in a living room and click on coffee bags, curtains, training shoes and books, providing them with information on the effect of caffeine and light as well as on the effects of lack of sleep on the sporting performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep withdrawal can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and cancer.
They are then encouraged to think about their daily routine by using a map of the university territory with interactive symbols.
“We know that it will not change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this -- just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health -- Professor Czeisler added.
The pride of pushing a “night layer” is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-growing pressure on students made sleep shortages a growing problem.
In order to ensure good sleep, the secret weapon should be all students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said. In addition, a weight gain was avoided, since sleep withdrawal would put the brain in the hunger mode so that they would be constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, and he spent his first year in Harvard last year taking one of his courses.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be invited to complete a similar study program before taking up their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler’s recommendation, students should be alert to sleep time and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” that comes from electronic screens and LED lightings and can take the English rhythm out of the clock.
Livingston vs. Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor forces Gerrards player
The Rangers lost another away game, as Dolly Menga's hit for Steven Gerrard's disagreeable team meant a 0:1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to book their first away win since the 4:1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard's first second defeat in 18 games as manager, so his team scored eight points behind the distance leading hearts in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before halftime, and the inspirational poor rangers seemed to have no chance to compensate.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and lies behind Hibernian only at the gate difference.
The Rangers also threaten further anger after liner Calum Spence had to be treated due to a head wound by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that Ayr took over and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, remained with the same eleven Livingston players who took the Hearts off one point last week, and had to be excited as his well-trained team kept their opponent on step and third.
The Rangers dominated the ball possession, but Livingston achieved more when they had the ball.
They were supposed to reach a goal after just two minutes, when Mengas' first assignment Scott Pittman led to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and shot next.
Then a long release from Keaghan Jacobs reached the captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot at the back.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third, their game acted more hopeful than convinced.
Alfredo Morelos obviously thought that after a quarter of an hour he should have been punished for a controversy between him and Steven Lawless, but judge Steven Thomson did not apply the Colombian complaints.
The Rangers reached only two goal committees in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibally's headball and a thin shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hit in the 34th minute may not correspond to the game course, it is not to deny that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers could not handle a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who held the rest and selected Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted half-time and traded Coulibally against Ryan Kent. The change almost immediately showed effect when the winger placed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to play exactly the game that lies with them, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving a long ball after the other.
Holt's team would have been able to expand their leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stood well and defended Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball out of the corner.
Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also called for a penalty for a divorce with Jacobs, but Thomson saw it go again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Count
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanach: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm-Hans-Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the counter counter numberer.
Since becoming the standard element of science, the pop culture has also become a standard element, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is that.
Rogers: “This is a gecko count used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals.
Evans: “In fact, I hear a crack.”
\"Hans - Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the invention that bears its name continues to exist.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” detonated cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy detonated cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine helps the immune system recognize detarted cells.
In the method, immune cells are taken from a patient that are changed in the laboratory.
These cells can “see” a lot of cancers of common protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
The ovary cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect detarted cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
In the method, patients are taken from immune cells that are modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” the many cancer species of joint protein HER2 and then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of the United States in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 - promotes the growth of various types of cancer - including breast, ovary, lung and intestine cancer, as Professor Berzovsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are taken immune cells and taught them to attack cancer cells has helped in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West released a Pro-Trump Tirade after his appearance at SNL, carrying a MAGA cap (“Make America Great Again”).
It didn't work well.
Kanye West was built at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he praised far-reaching U.S. President Donald Trump and said he wanted to join as a presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, Ghost Town, and carrying a make-america-great again cap, he continued his support for Trump with a smoldering cannon against the Democrats.
“I’m so often asked by whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.”
So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began broadcasting with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Justice Committee on the accusations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the record of West's chimpftirade was not sent, it was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock into social media.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of West's publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had difficulties behind the stage because of his head covering.
“You have shone me behind the stage.
They said, “Don’t go out with the cap.”
You've shone me!
And then they say I am in a sinking area, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues: “If you want to see the sunken area, he said he will “dress my supermancape, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love.
His remarks triggered at least twice Buhrope from the audience, and SNL employees were apologizing, Variety reported.
West had been forced as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture of the title “I Love It” in which he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: DANKE, DASS YOU ARE THE MASSER OF THE UNDERSTANDING HAST -
However, the talk show mother Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just him himself and it was absolutely wonderful.
“But I do not want to reward someone who, in my opinion, makes and gives himself a harmful ideology to my community (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his “art”).
He's free.
The same applies to us,” she added.
Before the broadcast, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now “The Being formally known as Kanye West” (the official Kanye West being).
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the deceased music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to “The Artist Formerly Known As Prince” (The former Prince).
Indictment for attempted murders related to sting injury in Belfaster Restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was injured with a knife at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is due to appear in Belfast on Monday before the Court of Arbitration.
The charges are reviewed by the prosecutor.
\"Game of Thrones\" Star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as heavy swinging Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones”.
However, the 31-year-old actor has attacked the macho hero's stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen would have caused boys to often feel the need to be strong to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believes something went wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married 31 fellow Rose Leslie, also at Game of Thrones, admitted that the problem was \"very important\".
“I personally find the question very important right now, what went wrong with the masculinity,” he said.
“What have we taught to grown-up men in relation to the problem we are now watching?”
Harington believes that television may be responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that makes boys feel the need to embody this particular side of a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change that?
For in the young men something has clearly gone wrong.
He also admitted in the interview that after the end of the series, he will not participate in prequels or sequels of \"Game of Thrones\" next summer.
As of November, Harington is seen in a new edition of Sam Shepards’ True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently told him that the best thing for him was “Game of Thrones” that he had met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife at this show, so I got my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie played in the numerous Emmy's excellent fantasy series Ygritte, the beloved of Harington's character Jon Snow.
In June 2018, both of them married to Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In contrast to the past, the transfer took place in the vast majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
To date, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials stated at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In comparison, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination from members of the LGBT community is expected to be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sexual intercourse with men are ultimately marrying women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to inadequate protection in sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged, among other things, general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees were allowed to search the data of the GOP senators, criticising \"dangerous lies\" and \"sacrifice theories\"
Maxine Waters, MP at the U.S. House of Representatives, contested on Saturday claims that a member of her staff has published the personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators on the Wikipedia pages of MPs.
Democrats from Los Angeles believe that the allegations of “ultraright-judged” experts and websites would spread.
“Lie, lie, and even more horrendous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information is intended to contain the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, and during the hearing of a Senate Committee on Supreme Court candidates Brett Kavanaugh, they were issued sexual offences by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three Senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the contributions, was assigned to Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
\"This unfounded charge is completely false and an absolute lie - water continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data, and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations, was in no way responsible for searching through this information.
This unfounded charge is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters’ statement quickly triggered criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
“This dementia is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This makes it clear that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a Congress member.
People who are accused of something they have not done should not be angry.
You must not be sorry.
You must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
You have to be calm and let go.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction with the criticism of Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry by critics during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who joins in half-time elections to dislodge water, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
\"Great thing if it's true, he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office has informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators will be revealed,” she continued, “and that they will be held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all the members of my staff.
Critique of \"Johnny English - You only live three times - weak espionage parody with Rowan Atkinson
It’s now a tradition to look for Brexit references in any new film that is colored in any UK. This seems to apply to this revitalization of the action comedy parody franchise, Johnny English, which, in 2003 with Johnny English, the spy who released it, started it, and in 2011 with Johnny English, now quite a bit of a shock.
Will an ironic self-parody on the topic, as obviously we are, become the new export chance for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glamorous, gritty-cut and incompetent Johnny English was extended to massage for the second time. His name signals more than anything else that it is a common comic creation for cinema visitors in the non-English-speaking room.
Of course, he is once again the clumsy secret agent who is bizarrely considered cool and worldly, while in reality he has contributed a single note to the title melody of “The Hour of the Winner” at the opening celebration of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos behind returning travelers and international secret agents, the Atkinson played in the now forgotten Barclaycard television games.
Johnny English's last adventure has one or two nice moments.
I was impressed by how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor, and the rotor leaves were short of his helmet.
Atkinson’s ability for physical comics is present today, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because even the “serious” film series such as “007” and “Mission Impossible” now offer self-secure comedy elements.
The humor seems to focus more on children than on adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy mischievousness is not as susceptible and focused as Atkinson's silent film gags in the role of bean.
The ever-present premise is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, very much to the failure of the serving agent, a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw half for the prime minister, an inflated and oppressed figure already standing before the total collapse due to their political unpopular: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script does not produce much she can work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform them that all active spies have been kidnapped and therefore she has to get someone out of retirement.
This includes the Tolpatschige Johnny English itself, who now works as a teacher at a sent institution, but does not have an official teaching in the work as a undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers an \"School of Rock\" remembering espionage academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting and reunited with his former heavily tested Kumpan Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, whose role Vicki Pepperdine has lost something.
So Batman and Robin, who are always making everything terrible wrong in your Majesty's secret service, are back in action, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerous in the bans of a charismatic tech billionaire, the window Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems.
English and Bough start their odyssee of big-sleeves: As Kellner wears a beautiful French restaurant, they take care of chaos when they smuggling aboard Volta’s luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s house with a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, however, all registers are drawn, but so sympathetic and fun it is, the subject is already being dealt with in detail on children’s television.
Very moderate substance.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, “Can’t the British film industry Rowan Atkinson give a role that will really satisfy his talent”
Labour argues to work on a plan after which the British will work four days a week, but will be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan that predicts that the British will work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
The party wants to report that corporate leaders will pass on savings to workers through the AI Revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional free day.
The employees would have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the party’s economic agenda and its plans to move the balance in the country in favor of the workers.
The conversion to a four-day week was promoted by the Trade Union Congress (Trades Union Congress) as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A high-ranking source from the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “Before the end of the year, a directive review is expected to be announced.
“A change will not take place overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that is consistent with the party’s approach to restoring the economic balance in favour of the workers and with the party’s general industrial policy strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first party to advocate such an idea. The Green Party already promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the approach is not currently supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: “A 4-day week is not party politics and it is not considered by the party.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell focused on his notion of a socialist revolution in the economy last week at the Labour Conference.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of \"anonymous directors\" and \"profitmakers\" at public supply companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not be able to recover their entire share, as a Labour government could do due to supposed misconduct — withdrawals.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to call workers to the board of companies and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand over 10% of the equity of private companies to the employees, cashing annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy express themselves in the news magazine — 60 Minutes — whether the FBI investigation in Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has shifted a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the results of the Authority could affect Republican Senators to win their support.
In a Sunday interview, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to the fore, which could ultimately change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I told in the negotiations that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him, that claim was expressed, and asked if he had done it.
He was determined, determined, and inexcusable.
Graham's voice seems to be in stone.
“My opinion is about Brett Kavanaugh, and it had to place a bomb,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has objected to this,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she called could not confirm it.”
It is now 36 years.
And I can't detect any changes,
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has helped to reduce poverty within the context of this festival?
This Saturday the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which takes place for the 7th time this year, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to sharpen awareness of the actual purpose of the event: to combat extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, which is an international interest group trying to fight poverty by encouraging more and more people to actively participate in poverty-related activities.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you must complete a number of tasks. These include actions such as volunteer work, communication with a leading politician worldwide (by email or telephone) or similar measures to increase awareness for the goal of fighting poverty.
How successful is the project when you consider that Global Citizens are still 12 years old to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of having a cool free concert in view, a meaningful way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clickivism - if you think you are going to change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen reported that since 2011 the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions by its supporters and achieve various goals.
These actions are designed to encourage leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion, which will influence the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been paid off or invested by fund-raising.
According to estimates by the group, the secured funds have a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important commitments are the project The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementationists based in the United Kingdom who have committed to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million in fighting malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that according to more than 5,000 actions requested by the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced the funding of the project The Power of Nutrition, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provides food interventions.
In answer to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of what are the reasons why global citizens can fight extreme poverty,
They said, “There will be a long and arduous journey with heights and depths.
But similar to the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements in front of us, we will be successful as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who are present at this year’s event in New York, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as Moderators.
The U.S. could use the Navy for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports - Ministry of Interior
According to Washington Examine, Washington can go back to the Navy if necessary so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s use in Syria is a prelude to exploring new energy markets. Russia is currently working at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
“I think the real reason for Russia’s use in the Middle East is to negotiate new sales markets in energy, just like in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are means and ways to address this.
“The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea roads remain open, and block them if necessary to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke turned to the participants of the event of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group known as “the voice of electricity consumers” in the United States.
He drew a comparison between Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran and found that they are virtually identical.
“The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said, referring to Russia as “One Trick Pony” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made when the government under Trump was extending the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and thus replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
For this purpose, government officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the \"unresponsive\" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, became the \"prisoner\" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth US$11 billion, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, an exclusive economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unspeakable competition.
“I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means to exert pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves,” said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. has received counter-winds from Germany that confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has invited the United States to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem when a businessman interferes in our energy supply,” said the board of BDI Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants a 2020 presidential candidacy to “exactly examine” the Senator for Massachusetts
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would “exactly check a presidential candidacy after the interim elections.”
During a Town Hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that involves women at the top.
Warren plans to \"exactly review a presidential candidacy\" after November 6th.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is turning this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy,” she said.
Warren did not speak in his criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that, of course, an FBI investigation is required before voting.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe that they should run for 2020.
According to Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe survey, 58 percent of Massachusetts’s potential voters said the Senator should not be able to run.
32 percent of voters supported such candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick; 38 percent who advocate a potential candidacy, and 48 percent who are opposed.
Among the other names of prominent Democrats that come into question regarding a possible 2020 candidacy are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden said he would officially decide by January.
Sarah Palin speaks on the Donald Trump Ralley for post-tumatic stress disorder, suffering from the track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What makes my son go through when he comes back, all that other families can feel the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds that our soldiers return with, she told the audience at a Ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as “Elephant in Space” and said about her son and other war veterans that they are changing back to come back, that they come back, and wonder if there is this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military have given to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence to a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Police Department of Wasilla.
18 States and D.C. support a legal aid to new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia support a legal aid to new U.S. policies that refuse victims of gang activities or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district submitted a court hearing on Friday in Washington to support an asylum applicant who questioned the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace-opposite session complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not announced.
She said her partner and his violent sons-in-law abused them, but U.S. officials refused their asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys supporting Grace called El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where many people are asking for asylum in the United States as nations who are struggling with major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy raised a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed illegal immigrants to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy \"is ignoring decades of legislation at state, state and international level\"
“The Federal Act requires that all asylum applications be answered based on the respective facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle,” the case-law statement stated.
The lawyers further argued in the statement that the policy that immigrants refuse access to the country would have an adverse effect on the U.S. economy, as immigrants could be more active than entrepreneurs and could provide the necessary jobs.
In June, federal attorney Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges who flee from domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs no longer grant asylum.
“Asylum is available to all who leave their home country because they are persecuted, or because of fear of race, religion, nationality, or affiliation to a particular social group or political conviction,” said Sessions in his announcement of the policy of June 11.
It was never the plan to remove all the problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems that people face every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of deaths in the race doubles over time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
“It’s all very exciting,” says the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, calming her little firing son in a rescue center in the destroyed downtown of Palu.
“Every minute a new hospital car comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Residents returned to their destroyed houses to collect their perplexed possessions and goods and to store everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals, which were damaged by the earthquake with the strength of 7.5, were completely overburdened.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who went to the hospital and a broken shoulder, stayed outside Palu’s military hospital, where patients in the outlying country were treated for the ongoing severe aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went a lot too fast.
I think I was stuck under the enclosed walls, he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s help calls, but then it was calm.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope that they are in a safe place.
U.S. ambassador charges China with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused the state capital Beijing of taking advantage of the U.S. press for propaganda purposes.
Last Wednesday, US Donald Trump referred to China's paid bill Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa after he accused China of joining U.S. congressional elections on November 6, a charge that China is arguing.
Trump's allegations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the U.S. elections correspond to the communication of U.S. officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to turn advertisements for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an out-of-date trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
The Chinese retaliation duties at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former longtime Governor of Iowa, who exports agricultural products to China to China to large extent, reported that Beijing has damaged workers, owners of agricultural farms and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a position in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, now doubles this tyranny by switching propaganda ads into its own free press in the United States.
“With the spread of their propaganda, the Chinese government claims the American-based tradition of free speech and the independent press by switching the country’s paid advertising into the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, you will find only limited contradictions to the newspaper skis here in Beijing and no real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese might have about China’s disturbing economic development, given the fact that the media is firmly in the hands of the Communist Party of China,” he wrote.
He added that one of China’s most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans pledge voters before the interim elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warning observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of several charges for sexual violence, observers have warned of a counter-reaction during the upcoming inter-elections, which could be carried out in particular by women.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already stated that they continue with a vote.
“That’s what you can’t go back to,” Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill, told a Saturday-published article.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute proposal was enough for an FBI investigation to embarrass angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what was yesterday, they don’t forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate's flurry called for \"November is coming\" when Republicans who are in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to hold Kavanaugh's nomination, and despite the statement of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, a impartial political observer of the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who, although they do not like the president, often do not choose.
Even before Ford’s public statement, in which their charges of sexual assault against the candidate of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could be the result if the Republicans advance the confirmation.
“This situation is a serious dispute for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, NBC News.
“It’s not only about the vote of the body, the final vote or the review of Kavanaughs; it’s also about the way Republicans dealt with it and how they treated it — Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to disagree, who should believe them because of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with a slightly larger proportion on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were absolutely or probably convinced by Ford’s statement, while 35% indicated that they definitely or probably gave Kavanaugh faith.
Furthermore, 38% said that they believe Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied to his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
According to Flake’s press, the FBI is currently investigating the charges presented by Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford issued an oath before the Senate Justice Committee that it was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had offended his genitals when they were at a party during their study period in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to oppose Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently bringing a startup to the market with the aim of establishing a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open-source platform.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the intent behind inrupt was the “world rule”.
“We need to be active now,” he said on the topic of startup.
“It’s a historical moment.
The app uses Solid’s technology so that users can create their own personal online data storage or POD.
It may include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library as well as other private and corporate tools.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in a browser and at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that the user can only decide who can access what data.
The company refers to this concept as personal reinforcement and development through data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and appropriate skills to make solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been hired to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers worldwide are able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change is to be made in which their entire business models will be completely redesigned overnight.

Priest Bernard Vann, a supporter of the Victoria Cross during World War I, was honored
The only clergy of the Church of England, awarded as a fighter with the Victorian Cross during World War I, was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his commitment to attack Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sharp-rescuer and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, as the memorial stone was revealed just 100 years after the hero's death, for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918, through dense fog and under heavy command of field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he pushed the line of fire and led the line forward with the “largest bravery” before sailing ahead with a field weapon in the alley and turning off three of the military units.
Colonel Vann was shot on October 4, 1918, by a German sharper man; a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the deeds of his grandfather were something he could never be justified, and at the same time something that makes a humble one.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid down a wreath after the parade under the direction of Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero will be visible, especially through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206 instead of Peppa Pig
Imagine you've stayed awake all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
San Jose's bill contained 13 battles, including 6 on the main card, and was broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Geward Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the viewers in the UK were not surprised when they suddenly saw Peppa Pig.
Some remained un touched after staying awake until the early morning hours to see the fight in particular.
A fan on Twitter described the change to the trick film figure as a somewhat bad joke.
“On the basis of a government regulation, this content is classified as not youthful-free, so it had to be changed to a child’s broadcast at 6 a.m.,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president in the field of marketing and communication at Bellator when he was asked about the transfer.
\"Peppa, the pig, exactly.\"
The company’s board of directors at Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company will process the execution plan to consider viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
“I think the problem could have been solved in the game of repetition,” he said.
“But it’s 6 o’clock in the morning on a Sunday with the viewers in the UK, and we will not solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time, there.
But we're gonna stay there.
The change was quite a lot communicated. It was very nice and it wasn't always all nice.
We have tried to solve the problem, and have assumed that it is a technical disorder.
What was not, it was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise that this won't happen again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 fights, as in the normal case, and we have tried to provide the fans with the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite regrettable.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels about sexuality
Tom Daley, who has participated as a water jumper in various Olympic games, says that he has grown up feeling that everyone else is inferior because of his sexuality, but that feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said he had only realized at the furthering school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the victories in Olympic games are no longer so important to him.
The real Moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses illness-related for a few months.
In Laverne’s first broadcast, he said he used to view himself as inferior compared to others, as love for boys and girls was socially unacceptable.
He said: “Today, the feeling of being different from others is to be different from others, reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he is a very special personality to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medalist at the Olympic Games is a prominent LGBT activist today and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he spoke on this subject because he could happily live without restrictions and without discrimination and want to encourage others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The knowledge to fall in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner in the previous year, but he shared that age difference has never been a topic.
He thinks that if you had to go through so much as a child and youth, he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time, and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone in the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple has had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley thinks his entire outlook has changed ever since.
In the last year, he had turned everything around gold medals.
But for him, there are now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main win.
He bears the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the approaching death, and one of the last things he asked for were the tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to be in front of it.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that did I finally realize that he is not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
“I just knew that it was always my dream to dive in front of the home public in Olympic games — that was madness,” he said.
His first song selection, Proud by Heather Small, was also influenced by this. He listened to the song in front of the Olympic Games and still took care of Gänsehaut.

Mickelson, who is not currently in shape, sits on the replacement bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to make a lot of effort so that the whole will not become a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays at the event for the 12th time, was sent to the replacement bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the event, the five-time major winner spent his day firing others and working at his game, hoping to solve the problems that burdened him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misdirected balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself wouldn’t be discouraging enough, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson meets the perfectionist British Open-Champion Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, Neuling at those tournaments to win all four games this week.
If the Americans put a hot start with four points back at the 12 individual games, Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk confidently expressed himself to Mickelson and couldn’t add much to it either.
“He was perfectly aware of his current role, gave me a clapp on his back and put his arm around me and said he’s ready for tomorrow,” he said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is one of the world’s best-known personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd be there at two games.
I've presented myself more, but that's how it's been, and that's what we've been expecting.
He wants to be like everyone else, too.
Mickelson will reach Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup matches released on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup runway, which never completely corresponded to the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 wins, had to pitch 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk announced that his presence alone had enriched the team.
“He’s funny and sarcasm, original and he likes to do a few pieces, and he’s a great person who’s popular with the whole team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little more this week, and it was fun to watch them.
He is a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses.
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows it can be over with the lead soon
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great lead leading into the last individual games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
In 1997, the Dane debuted in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans, but just barely crossed the finish line and led the smallest possible lead, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“The idea remains that we had a great lead in Valderrama, we had a great lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but that was hardly so,” said Bjørn (pictured in the photo) after he saw the victory 5-3 of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it is not over.
You're going to be right tomorrow.
Put yourself into the stuff and do exactly the right thing.
The whole thing is only over when the points are on the display table.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and right there lies our focus.
I’ve always said it, I’ve been focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re fully aware of what’s facing us on the other side: the best players in the world.
Froh about the performance that his players performed on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never overstep it.
Tomorrow will be another caliber.
Tomorrow the individual services are at the forefront and this is a completely different thing.
It’s great to work with a partner when things are running well, but if you’re out there alone, then you’ll be tested as a golfer up to the limits of your skills.
You have to make it clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he has to get the best out of himself too.
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players cut off individually better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those major tournaments on the last day of the tournament, standing in Brookline on the winner side before standing on the side of the losers after Europe’s “Wonder of Medina”.
“I remember every damn word,” he answered the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to pull off the quick start you saw in Brookline and Medina.
When the momentum hits a direction, it puts the average games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out the way we feel, you know, we're trying to enchant tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of resisting, he must compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as further Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
“I decided for the boys in this order because I believe it covers everything — Bjorn said about his choice for the individual encounters.
Germany’s new warship is delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy would have been put into service in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War in the years to come, but according to local media, they will only be delivered at the earliest of next year due to faulty systems and rapid growth costs.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the leading ship of the brand-new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been moved to the first half of 2019, according to the time that called on a military spokesperson.
The ship was already supposed to be employed in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by disturbing problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class, which were already ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen-Class.
They are designed to contain a powerful cannon, a series of flight defence missiles and sea target aircraft as well as tarn technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
The ongoing delays may, however, lead to the fact that the state-of-the-art warships to represent Germany as sea power will already be obsolete at the time of its inception, according to The Time.
The Frigate F125 was in the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned the yard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the yard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a number of significant \"software and hardware errors\" that would have made the new ship useless in a fighting situation.
Software problems are particularly serious as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as much as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It has also been known that the ship is far too difficult, which leads to a breach of performance and prevents the Navy from carrying out relief measures in the future.
The 7,000 tons heavy \"Rheinland-Palatinate\" was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, became a problem.
The cost of stunning €3.1 billion was apparently increased, compared to the originally provided €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant in view of recent warnings that the sea power of Germany is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Armed Officer of the German Bundestag, confirmed that the Navy is \"going out of the capable ships\"
Bartels said that the problem became greater over time, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He claimed that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken away from the Navy.
National Trust Laughs at the Secret Life of the Fleet
In an estate in the Scottish Highlands, new research works are being carried out to show how bats use the landscape in food search.
It is hoped that the results will enable further insights into the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will trace rabbit and mussel bats, as well as the brown Langohr and water bats in Inverewe Garden in West Ross.
Special recording devices are placed in key positions on the property to record the activities of the bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In a noise analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of the bat calls is determined and determined which species does what.
A map and a report of the habitat are then created to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, a naturalist for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by any species.
These data will help determine the benefits of the measures to manage the habitat, such as creating ways, and show how to obtain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat's existence in Scotland and the entire United Kingdom has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which affect sleeping places and lead to the loss of the habitat.
Windwheels and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flying prisoners and chemical treatment of building materials or also attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful because of their nightly hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo to detect insects and obstacles in their flightway.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, inspections of dormitories and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only bat reserve in the Threeave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s 10 bat species.
Good-for-nothing manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living space.
But there are many things we don’t yet know about bats, so here and on other goods we’ll do these works that will help us learn more about what bats we need to feel comfortable.
He emphasizes the importance of excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, since it is possible that the indecent destruction of a single nest place could kill up to 400 females and young animals and remove the entire population on site.
Fleet mice are under protection and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or destroy them or their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to assist.
She explains: “We still have to learn a lot about bats and in many of our species we don’t know what their populations are like.
Ronaldo denies rape charges while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to rape allegations raised against him as “Fake News” and said that people want to be famous for using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The storm of the Portugal and Juventus Turin national team was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then paid her $375,000 to buy her silence to the incident, according to The Mirror on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to its 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports only hours after their release as “Fake News”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News - said the five-time winner of the balloon d’Or in the camera.
“You want to profile yourself by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to become famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's good - the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror because of the allegations they described according to Reuters as “unauthorised reporting on suspects in the field of privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a replacement for “moral damage in a high that corresponds to the severity of the violation of law, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident will have occurred in 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went into the player’s room, where he had raped them in advance, according to documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Maiorga claims that Ronaldo went to the knee after the alleged incident and told her that he was “99 percent a good guy” who was “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but said it had been reasonable.
Maiorga also claims that she had gone to police and had taken photo footage of her injuries in a hospital, but later turned to an extrajudicial agreement, since she had \"angry about retribution\" and was worried to become \"publicly humiliated.\"
The 34-year-old said she was now trying to lift the agreement, as she was still traumatized because of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident, and this summer he turned into a 100 million-dollar deal to Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The UK would \"ever regret\" the loss of car manufacturers
The UK would “ever regret” it if after Brexit it lost its status as a world-leading manufacturer of cars, economic minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “anxious” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would interrupt production at the Burnaston plant at Derby in the first place, Britain should leave the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the impact of delays on the border could result in a no-deal Brexit loss of jobs.
The plant in Burnaston, in which Toyota's product lines Auris and Avensis are produced, produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will experience production stops at the end of March at an uncontrolled Brexit in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised fears of a harsh EU exit without an agreement and its influence on cross-border trade.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its mini-work in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to risks within the supply chain at a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s manufacturing plant is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the United Kingdom and the EU to make the cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could result in interruptions to the borders that, according to the industry, could lead to delays and engagements in the parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to run a warehouse in the factory in Derbyshire which lasted longer than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa Mays Chequers’ plan on the future relationship with the EU is \"accurately designed to avoid such controls at the border.\"
“We need a deal. We want the best deal that I’ve already said allows us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take this opportunity,” he said in the BBC Radio 4 broadcast today.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far.”
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the Unite trade union at work, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience will never come back when they’re gone.
A government spokesperson said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump’s planned meeting with Rosenstein could be reassigned according to White House data
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week, during the dispute over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, it was called out of the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has reviewed the work of the special investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates the election interventions by Russia, links between Trump’s advisers and Russia, as well as a possible legal disability by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Vice Justice Minister and thereby endanger the independence of Muellers has been the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
Early in the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was addressing the possibility of secret recording of his talks with Trump as well as the president's office appointment using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein commented on the report.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, while new reports of his supposed resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was held at the UN General Assembly in New York City at this time, was announced for the next Thursday,
Trump said he would prefer not to dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid it colliding with the U.S. Senate Justice Committee hearing, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press spokesperson Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
She answered a question about the meeting with Rosenstein: “A date has not yet been set for this. It could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be delayed for another week, given all the things just going on with the Supreme Court.
This will show up, but I always like to keep the press up-to-date.
Some reporters would probably object to this claim: Sanders has not held the White House press conference since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences does not lie at a disadvantage with the “effect-hate” of TV reporters, but admitted: “I wouldn’t argue that they are doing effect-hate.”
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press was going to take place.
The President made more question-and-answer rounds than any President before him, she explained without accurate evidence: “We have considered these figures.”
There will still be press conferences, says Sanders, but it is, “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States questions directly, yet far better than talking to me.
We often try to do this and you’ve seen that we’ve done it over the past few weeks. This will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this was the case when he ran out of the rudder before gathered reporters and sometimes made a more bizarre appearance.
Minister of Health writes due to the Brexit concern of EU workers from the Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health is turning to people from the EU who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and to express their desire to remain in the country even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the costs of applications for residence for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, the exit negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued and decisions will be expected this autumn.
However, the UK government has also strengthened preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of what disturbing times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Our colleagues and colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, thus benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very pleased if you stayed here -
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to a head injury after an emergency operation
The linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was reportedly subjected to a head injury by Mike Organ of Tennessee State on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, an emergency operation.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State head coach, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time break.
“He came to the sideline and just broke up there,” said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel provided abercrombie on the sideline with oxygen before being placed on a carry and transported off for further investigations.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the OP at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details on the type or extent of the injury” are known and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called redshirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after switching over from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 packles, increasing his total number to 18 packles during the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for real estate purchase in the UK
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax for the purchase of properties in the UK in the future, and the additional revenue will be to benefit homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This step will end the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign for young voters
The increase in stamping fee will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy property in the UK, with the multi-income homeless benefit.
This step is an attempt to intimidate Jeremy Corbyn’s success with young voters who promise to provide more affordable living space and to take top-ranking viewers into sight.
The increase in stamp tax is imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional revenue is to be paid to the government campaign against homelessness.
The storage, which is raised in addition to the current stamp tax and including the two-year increase in second housing and rental property, could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects up to 120 million pounds a year by the step.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built property in London is purchased by investors who are not based in the United Kingdom, thereby driving prices to the height and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to take foot in the real estate business.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become \"spirit cities\" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of the time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke out for a reduction in stamp tax to allow more young people to have their first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping real estate prices up by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end Britain's \"wanting space\"
Opposition leader Corbyn announced an exciting series of proposals for residential reforms ranging from a rental price bond to the ban of premises without a trivial reason.
He also wants to give more power to city councils in the construction of new apartments.
May explained: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream, according to which the life from generation to generation should be better.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as it is for companies based abroad to buy real estate as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of the home has become too far away for too many people and the inevitability of homelessness continues to be a big problem.
Jack Ross: “My biggest goal is to manage Scotland.”
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says it is his “largest goal” to become the Scottish team’s manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of raising the club from the North East of England’s new life, which is just in third place in League One and missing the three points to the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and it was,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s sports sound.
“But I’ve often seen Scotland play in Hampden as a child with my father, and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in association management.
Ross's predecessor in the role as manager of Sunderland includes Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former chief of Alloa Athletic stated that he was not afraid to step into the footsteps of such established names at such a club after previously refusing offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured by me right now as to whether I can take the club back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities in this association, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
\"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I'd probably only appreciate my time here as a success if I brought the club back there.\"
Ross can have a three-year management career, after a phase as Deputy Chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month career as a Trainer in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says he now feels better than ever in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“That was probably a real divorce path,” he remembers when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than games.
It sounds funny because I didn’t work hard, could live well, and experienced some very pleasant high-phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to do every week.
I still do this through stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I’ve always wanted to manage and now I’ve done it. I’ve never felt so good in my skin as an adult all my life.

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 17:30 a.m., a study
The heat wave in summer has missed the revenue of Britain’s crippling pubs, while restaurant chains are under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded sales growth of 2.7 per cent in July. However, the revenue at the restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the CGA, who compiled the figures, explained: “Recognising sunshine and England’s longer than expected continued participation in the World Football Championship meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June in which pubs were able to record revenue increases of 2.8 percent.
The 1,8 percent decline in the restaurant industry in June continued in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on beverages showed the best performance, with an area-adjusted sales development rising higher than they had at the restaurants.
Pubs focused on food also left in the sun, but not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.
It seems as if people just wanted to go to a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, alcohol sales increased by 6.6% per month, while food sales decreased by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, of the analysts for the RSM leisure and hospitality sites, said: “These results continue the trend we have been able to observe since late April.
The weather and influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, but revenue losses of 4.8 percent over the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have been a worse time for operators of companies with a focus on food, and it remains to be expected whether the moderate temperatures in August will provide the urgently needed breath break.
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including re-opens, rose 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry turnover monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined revenue of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognized industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret accounts in social media that hide it from their parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in further schools has found an increase in so-called \"Fake Insta\" pages.
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students reported having a “head account” to show it to their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at further schools showed a rapid increase in so-called “Fake Insta” accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of students reported having a clean “head account” that they can show to their parents, equally but also own private accounts.
A mother, who was on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who asked others to rape me.
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitted to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes \"the voice of athletes\" in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Board Scottish Athletics Association.
Doyle is Scotland’s most frequently excellent athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
“Eilidh is respected in the Athletics community of Scotland, Britain and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their choice in the Council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I look forward to acting as the athlete’s voice and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, called a total of four Olympic gold medals his own and now appears to be a BBC expert, was unable to run after a prior bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell whether or how far I will be healed.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you so much for the encouraging news.
An advertisement for milk pumps comparing mothers to cows provides excitement on the net
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided excitement on the network with an advertising clip in which silent mothers are compared to the milking of cows.
To introduce the milk pump, which is portable worldwide, according to its own statement, the consumer technology manufacturer Elvie published a not very serious music video to emphasize the freedom that the pump gives silent mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn filled with hay with cows in the background to a song that contains lines of text such as: “Yes, I milk myself, but you don’t see a tail in me, or “if you haven’t noticed it, that’s not a udder but my breasts”
In the Refrain, it continues: “Pumpe it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies”
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page of the company has caused a controversy on the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video found mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom say that the “fears” of the dairy industry are harmless.
“It was a very bad decision to apply for this product with cows.
Like us, they have to become drunk and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys are taken away within a few days of birth - it was in a comment.
Elvie’s milk pump fits decently into a still-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Surely traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies.\"
Another person added: “This is a reality-for-nothing advertising.
Others defended the advertising and a woman admitted that she found the song 'urcomic'.
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still silent.
When pumping, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a witty advertisement directed to mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or on toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that all of them have done so with the discrete pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who use milk pumps indicate that they feel like milk cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely noiseless, has no wires or hoses and discreetly fits into a still-BH, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, or even exit during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a wagered and provocative market launch.
By comparing silent mothers with milk cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the challenges involved while at the same time presenting the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump allows.
This is not the first time that Elvie’s pump has moved into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, for designer Marta Jakubowski, a double mother appeared on the Catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrants were brought silently to a tent town on the Texan border
The number of international migrants is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, among other things, there have been sharpened rhetoric and measures by the Trump government that have made it more difficult to accommodate children in caregivers.
Usually, most caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and now are afraid to become a target disc for an issue when they sign up to accommodate a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to hand out their fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official of the Customs Administration Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared before Congress that the authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unoccupied minors.
The authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the prisoners had no previous entries in the criminal registry.
Almost 80 percent of those who are either themselves caregivers or members of a caretaker’s household remain illegal in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
That’s why we will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In order to be able to process the cases of the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that according to employees of the accommodation in some children, within a month instead of appearing in court 60 days after the arrest, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear by video circuit and not personally in order to enter before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the case of negative decisions, the person is quickly expelled.
The longer these children stay in custody, the more likely it is to be, according to the information of the accommodation staff as well as reports that in recent months from the system, they have become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreak attempts.
Defenders say that these concerns are strengthened at a larger facility such as tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems, due to the size being overlooked more easily.
They also explained that it could strengthen traumas that many of the children are already suffering if they are brought to a tent town without emotional preparation or sufficient time to leave for friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, explained that the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil with the preface of the fight against terrorism and are being treated accordingly.
“You have to withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he explained to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” is in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed in 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus \"will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence\"
The United States has stationed about 2000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and consulting both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land troops in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem explained that the conditions were given for their return and he accused “some Western countries” of spreading “irlogical fears” of stopping the refugees from going home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to allow homecoming,” he said.
“They are politicizing a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union warned that no aid for Syria will be granted as long as there is no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats explained that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel-hochburg Idlib presents the possibility for the advance of political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia into the province in which three million people live.
Moualem, however, emphasized that the agreement has “clear time limits” and expressed his hope that military measures against jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, which will be “slaughtered out.”
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon be able to call for the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem called the conditions of the Syrian government for participation in the Committee and explained that his work should be limited to the “reworking of the articles of the current constitution” and warned of interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal viewers probably hope, end an office detainee or a scandal his presidency prematurely.
This would be without a doubt the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time.
So far, there are no signs that the viewers would have been satisfied.
Since 2014, the turn-on rates have more than doubled at CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled at MSNBC to 1.6 million.
Fox News reported that Fox News reached an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Madddow Show” led the turn-on quote to 3.5 million viewers in evenings with important news.
“It’s like a fire that’s magically attracting people, as it’s something we don’t understand — so Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series “Designated Survivor” broadcast on the TV broadcast ABC — about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-time comedy writer and author of the book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he would choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh’,” Scovell told me.
The chaos is worth entertainment.
Of course, Washington stories can be found in contrast to anything on television, the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible merging of families and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it’s also about being an informed citizen when one becomes aware of having seen six hours of an expert round already over Bob Woodward’s use of sources from the so-called “Deep Background” for his book “Fear” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 worth of street leather bomber jacket ( according to Washington Post, a piece of clothing rich in self-examination) or the effects of Stormy Daniel’s mysterious description of Trump’s, hems, anatomy.
I will never be able to see Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“Some of what he does can feel like a reality show he’s putting on an evening,” says Brent Montgomery, chief manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series “The Three of the Pandhouse” about Trump’s rotating occupation and daily operations (a dispute with the NFL’s football league breaking the fence, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t afford to miss a follow-up, or you won’t come with it anymore.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees off his home on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crashed inside and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn’t solve the screen, not if Judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh was shortly in front of the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we made all these crazy broadcasts at the time and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought that was a sort of joke, but it turned out that they were right.”

Donation funds flow the closest races to seats in Congress in the interim elections
It is little surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded by donation funds, thanks to the new borders of the electoral districts, which led to two officials standing in the race for the same seat.
The recently re-signed suburb district in Pittsburgh leaves the Democrat Conor Lamb to join and win his seat in another district in the course of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb joins another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps with the new 17th district.
The cards were re-signed after the state of Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were violated the constitution and manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a exchange of election campaign funding between the major financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a highly respected special election in March around the state's 18th electoral district.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and Trump won a 20-percent lead there.
Political experts offer a light leadership to Democrats.
The U.S. reviewed El Salvador’s punishment for its support for China, but then back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without giving up on major resistance from Washington.
Trump graduated from a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners threw out the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. Foreign Ministry officials have decided to withdraw the head of all U.S. foreign affairs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “the latest decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, the Ministry’s spokeswoman in a statement early in the month.
However, only in El Salvador's case were thought about criminal action, which in 2017 received an estimated $140 million in American aid services, including drug controls, development and economic assistance.
The proposed criminal measures, including shortening financial benefits and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials shifted a high-ranking conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar assembly in the previous year and presented a step forward in efforts to stop migrants from moving towards the United States.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and thus effectively ended the consideration of criminal measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now provided as a speaker at the mid-October conference to set a sign of the importance that the government of the assembly has given to diplomats.
The three U.S. diplomatic representatives have returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new scrupulous communications or criminal action from Washington.
A government spokesman for John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to express themselves to the internal meetings under the terms of anonymity.
Their opinions were backed up by one of the government's closest external analysts, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next great surprise could be the report by the special investigator Robert Mueller on Trump's possible legal disability, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public domain.
Mueller is now also investigating whether Trump's election campaign team has conspired with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
Should the majority of Congress change, Trump sees himself facing an organ that forces him to account for himself, exactly at the time he is about to step back before the electorate; and possibly before a jury jury.
These are many “ifs” and I don’t want to say that Donald Trump’s case, or that his European pendants are inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were willing to make a coup against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and had supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do when Trump dismisses Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, that is, the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein spoke in Satan’s kitchen since this newspaper last year reported that he suggested to secretly record the president and speculated about being above inappropriate for the office.
Rosenstein denounces the New York Times' presentation.
“How will we respond if the newly appointed FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or he is confirmed in spite of credible charges of sexual abuse and the false statement in office?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that forces Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we will face a long winter.
But I think we're not going to fail because of what I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz from the same regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me out 60 years later to light up Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remis against Villareal in Spain in the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for the qualification of the Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans was unable to appear up to the 2-2 equation against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for larger ones.
“That was an important point for us, as Villareal is very good,” says the 31-year-old.
We went to the game with the conviction that we can make something out of it, and we went home with one point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but overall, a disagreement was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we struggled in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a difficult match as they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I’m sure we can go through this with the audience and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is some kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind us and be successful.
Fear of age-preservation leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the participants of the survey knew exactly how to care for them, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study of Nationwide reported talking to your spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent told their children to talk about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t take the necessary steps to lead the conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Life Insurance Savings of Nationwide.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes in time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your consultant can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your long-term financial decisions may include traditional care insurance, hybrid capital-forming life insurance to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Turn down disputes in the last minute.
Set up a precaution, so that you appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health professionals meet your wishes, you should be out of the question to express them yourself.
Consider also a power for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your invoices are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication intake or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“Not only do financial issues play a role. Who are the doctors,” Martin asked.
“What is medical treatment?”
Who cares about the dog?

Man shot in Ilfracombe several times with air gun
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he went home after a job with friends.
The victim, a man in the 1940s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
Officials described the shootings that took place at about 02:30 British time as a \"willful act\"
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life threatening and the police were looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities said.
Due to the failing communication systems, aid forces were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with the strength of 7.5.
Over 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district that extends over a coastal section of over 300 km (180 miles) in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, there were an estimated 299,200 people living in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue for the economy of Central Sulawesis, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickelab construction is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
Palu and Donggala have repeatedly been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s disaster protection authority.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami in which nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the six-mixed Pacific fire ring, and is regularly housed by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatras triggered a tsunami on December 26, which hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatras between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatras.
2006: An earthquake with the strength of 6.8 shook the southern Java, Indonesia's most populated island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed almost 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake with the strength 7.6 met on the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with the strength of 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai islands before Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters in height, destroying dozens of villages and demanding about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya government district in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from collapseing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the popular Indonesian island of Lombok, demanding more than 500 deaths on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and former candidates for the office of Vice-President, was arrested because of allegations of body injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested due to the suspicion of domestic violence, the disability of the report of domestic violence and the resistance to state violence, a report published on Saturday by Alaska Police.
According to the police report, he took off the phone when he wanted to understand the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in investigation in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and it was raised a deposit of $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked for his plea, he answered with “no fault, absolutely sure,” the network said.
Palin is accused of having committed three class A order crimes, which can be punished with up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with an orderly rejection of Class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before Alaska’s Veteran Court.
In January 2016, domestic violence, disability of the reporting of a crime and possession of weapons were brought to him under the influence of fraud in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of striking her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by Veterans organizations in 2016 after returning her son’s behavior to a post-tREAMatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communication networks have been interrupted and it is expected that the number of deaths will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesis, located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
At the social networks, videos circulated from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutor calls for rare death sentences for suspects in New York terrorist attack
The federal prosecutor in New York calls for the death penalty for Sayfulo Saipov, the defendants in the New York City terrorist attack, which cost eight lives, a rare sentence that has not been imposed on the state since 1953 for federal crimes.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a rented pick-up of the Home Depot building market chain for a terrorist attack, on the train he raced along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, crossing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov’s eight-of-the-art death-dealing and “conscious” body injuries were a result of serious bodily injuries, as stated in the statement of intent for the demands of the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigation court, Saipov, filed an indictment in 22 points covering eight charges of murder against the background of organized crime, which are usually used by state prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as a charge of violence exercise and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “fundamental planning and intent,” according to the prosecutors, who described the manner in which Saipov carried out the act as “disgusting, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and losses,” the statement said.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the southern district of New York no longer pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time that the death penalty was carried out in New York during a federal offence was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were guilty of conspiracy for the Soviet Union two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were executed with the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified in the days and months after the attack of lack of repentance, according to court documents.
He told investigators to feel good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was really inspired after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, the prosecution said.
According to police, he also called for the ISIS flag to be hanged in his hospital room.
He declared himself not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were \"seriously disappointed\" because of the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of accepting a debt in exchange for a lifetime sentence of freedom without the possibility of release, will only extend the trauma that all stakeholders experience,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the charge not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative Party MP calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize “the power of the people” today during a protest action in the context of the Tories conference.
Ukip’s former party chief stated that politicians must feel pressured by the Euroskeptics while a Theresa Mays party MP suggests that Farage should conduct negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative backer Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be “ready outside” if Farage was Brexit minister.
The challenge facing May in the reconciliation of its deeply disparaging part was reinforced by the participation of members of your party, who are for a stay in the EU, in a separate demonstration against the Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems keeping their compromise plan Chequers on course despite attacks by Brexit advocates, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that despite the counter-reactions, they continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, forcing Euroskeptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the chaos.
Bone explained on the “Leave Means Leave” demonstration in Solihull that “Chequers belong to the garbage”.
He suggested that Farage be named a peer and that he should have been responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible for this, we would be out there,” he said.
Wellingborough’s MP added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the garbage.”
His opposition to the EU clearly stated: “We have not voted in World Wars to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejects allegations that public opinion has changed since the referendum in 2016: “The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
The Brexit advocate of the Conservatives Andrea Jenkyns was also on the demonstration and told reporters: “I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and in our activists who are actually going through the streets and making sure we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a peak message to May, she continued: “Premier minister keep their jobs when you keep their promises.”
Farage stated in a statement that politicians must “feel the pressure,” they should be right now to cheat the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“They are trying to cheat Brexit, and that is why we are here today to tell them, ‘You’re not coming out of it.’
In front of an exciting crowd, he added: “I want you to let our political class, which is just about to betray Brexit, feel pressure.
“We mobilize the power of the people of this country, which will help us to victory in the referendum and will never come to rest as long as we are not independent, self-managing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour announcement in the city centre.
A few activists swung banners of the Tories Against Brexit Grouping, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, which was launched on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, partner of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories, who had safety problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, like all the technology for Canada Plus, for the smooth border, are available for free trade without limits in Ireland,” Adonis said.
“This is a farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “exactly review” presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she will “exactly check the presidential candidacy after the November elections.”
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts about their future.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is just in the race for re-election for the Senate against Republican MPs in the Massachusetts Geoff Diehl parliament, who was vice chairman of Trump's election campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the focus of speculation that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been their 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump's entry.
One of the people present asked her if you would like to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that involves women at the top.
arrest after death committees on LSU player Sims
Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in case of fatal shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims from Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the shots.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot injury and died as a result of this injury,” according to the sports media portal 247sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being in the place and possession of a weapon and to have shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-metre-tall Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starts during the last season and could have an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prize of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship title after his team has left the win over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed in the qualifying front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes's stable orders would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas got a good start and it was almost as if he was leading Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton get into traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that would have been crucial.
The Mercedes went a round later into the box and landed behind Vettel, but overtook Hamilton after a tight wheel-on-wheel maneuver, where the Ferrari pilot resisted the inside released, at the risk of two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen began on one of the backs of the field and placed seventh on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for most of the race, as he held on to his tyres to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally entered the box in the 44th round and failed to take a step in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri spent the whole weekend performing excellent performance and acting like a real gentleman when he was supposed to leave me.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double win, according to Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein, who insisted that Christine Blasey Ford's letter condemning him to the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh sexual abuse was not passed on to the press.
At the West Virginia event, President Ford’s statement before the Senate’s Justice Committee did not directly address, but commented that the actions in the Senate show that people are “common, vicious and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and mean and angry and dishonest,” the president said.
“When you look at the leaks, you say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
I wasn't,
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your response... Did you publish the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't published it -
Okay, please for a moment.
No, we haven't published it, he added, by following the Senator's voice.
Feinstein was charged with Ford’s charges against Kavanaugh in July and he was released in early September, but Feinstein argues that the leak comes from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I haven’t published your story,” Feinstein said to the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep the letter secret and I answered her request for confidentiality.
Her dementi didn’t seem to be coming well with the president, who said on Saturday evening at the election campaign: “I told you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
In his continuous defense of the judge's candidate, who is accused of sexual assaults by three women, the Democrats claimed to be using the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
One sees the civility, evilness, they don’t care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars scored the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by a 5:3 victory in the back game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead with two goals early on, following the encounters of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the compensation for the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee on Friday evening 2-1 in Belfast unexpectedly, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening gate took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the presentation when Beauvillier built the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie moved to his compensation gate after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer assured the Giants' leadership before half-time, when he reached his second gate of the evening just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped new and Bouchard regrouped with a power play match in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee in the match for the first time late in the second half. Nielsen then secured his team the victory with a fifth goal after almost half of the second half.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play at home next Friday at Milton Keynes Stadium.
Flight fates died after he was sure that hundreds of people in a plane escaped the earthquake
A flight lot in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found the death to securely launch an aircraft with hundreds of people on board.
Over 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was rocked on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the strong swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could be safely lifted.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was crashing.
Agung later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for the Indonesian flight safety service, explained that this decision might have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News.
“We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could enter Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message, he added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the number of dead could rise to several thousand. The country’s disaster protection authority declared that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is expected to rise as many bodies are still under the debris, while others cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesperson for Sutopo Purwo.
Waves of up to 6 meters in height have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new hospital car comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: “The Indonesian Red Cross is quick to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and declared in a speech before the country’s military: “I ask you to work every day and night to do all the tasks involved in evacuation.
Since you were ready, CNN.
Indonesia was already rocked this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where over 550 people were killed.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports of a missing plane crash in Laguna
The airline, who conducted the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports of a missing person after she first claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that they can say nothing about a passenger’s stay until Saturday afternoon.
The airline stated working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crews after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials told us that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but were in a stable state.
The cause and exact execution of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very flat.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others could bathe through half-deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working nearby to improve an installation site rushed with an inflatable boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
The Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 people were killed in the crash of Papua New Guinea-registered airlines, but none of them were affected by Air New Guinea.
Analyst rebuilds the end of the night in which a woman was living
On Saturday, the charge ended her conduct of evidence in the renegotiation of a case in which a man is accused of having expelled a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett said for hours as an expert in information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he rebuilt the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chamber victim on their death night on the phone calls.
Rowlett said he had received position data from various cell phones that showed that Tellis was together with Chambers on the evening of her death, contradicting his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period when he indicated that he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford entered the witness stand on Saturday and said he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he had been in Sanford’s pick-up that night, Sandford said he had lied, “that my pick-up was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Tellis indicated that Chambers had known at her death point for two weeks.
However, cell phone records indicate that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis had been released from his cell phone some time after Chamber's death of their messages, calls and contact information.
“He cut it off from his life, so Hale.
The defense will begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will go before the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claim that Hip Hop has distanced himself from its roots from the political message and social commitment.
They want to go back to its roots and make socially conscious hip hope again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common experienced a Renaissance in the UK in recent times by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York-based girl accuses couple for a release of “racist” SMS
A New York girl accuses a couple because of a discriminatory release after receiving a misdirected message from the mother, in which she complained that she is still a black one.
The couple objected to being racist and compared the legal dispute with a “repression”
The double mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her frustration when she found out that the new day's mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first day of work in 2016.
“NOEEEEEEEEEI, NO ONE SWARZE,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending them to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After recognizing her fauxpas, the \"painful touch\" Plasco-Flaxman Maurice revealed that the imprisoned African American daily mother had done bad work and instead expected a Philippine, the New York Post said.
Maurice was paid for her work day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice accuses the couple of compensation for the release and claims compensation for the 350 dollars per day, which they would have spent over six months of the job for which they were originally booked, but without a contract, and for which they had lived with the couple.
“I want to show them, look, what you don’t do,” she told the newspaper on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple rejected the racism allegations, arguing that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice, after insulting them, could not trust any more.
“My wife sent her something that she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” said husband Joel Plasco of the post.
“But would you trust your children of a person who was rude to them, even if it was due?”
Your newborn baby?
\" Welcome to You \"
Plasco compared the legal dispute with a “repression” and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was “in a difficult situation.”
“You want such a person to be interested?
This is not very nice, added the investment banker.
While the legal dispute continues, the couple were quickly convicted in public and appealed to the social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear, revealed a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of the author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to put himself in someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
Today it's very funny with our knowledge of Paddington's huge success.
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had no problem with it, would have rejected his work and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death last year was \"bitterly.\"
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington’s success, which she described as “very important family member.”
“He was a very quiet man and didn’t brag,” Jankel said.
“Because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost as if you had a child who has something special: you are proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself responsibility for his success.
My daughter died and I had to leave her by phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it really looks bad and that the doctors gave her little chance,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I received the call from Nad, where he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I told her, “Tashi, I love you so much, my treasure.”
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications you gave the doctors to keep their heart at the pump slowly gave off and left their bodies.
She had just died and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't do anything except to wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to get rid of myself.
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, along with the other passengers who didn’t get anything of what she was going through, went on board the plane.
“No one knew,” she told me.
I had lowered my head and tears ran all the time over the cheeks.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Tragic women hang cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost members through a suicide attempt to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hanged on a bridge in Wales cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers for consulting sites.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he began suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and he had a smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could light up a room.
However, he announced his job before his death, as he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found by his then 11-year-old brother after the terminal.
Davis said, “I’m always afraid that this could have an impact.”
Davis designed the cards “to show people that there are people to whom you can go and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t keep quiet: you have to talk about it.
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years together, shortly after her mother died.
“He didn’t say that he felt down or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day he was at the bottom, and when the children unpacked their gifts, he did not see them in their eyes or anything else.
She said that her death was a great trauma for her, but that had to be done: “It breaks a huge hole into the family.
It breaks us down.
But we all have to go on and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the Schwebe while the FBI begins investigating
“I thought that if we could actually get something like this he asked for, that is, a timely and limited investigation, then perhaps we could get a little bit of attention, so Flake on Saturday. He feared that the committee would break apart in the party political stand-off.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Your refusal can be traced to timing alone.
The mid-elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If the Republicans were to cut badly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to select their husband to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush got the phone caller to call Senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to decide on vote equality, and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean overflowers \"sinkt\" under Kim
Since Kim Jong-un, seven years ago, the number of North Korean floods to South Korea has fallen to power, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, which relies on data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, stated that last year 1127 flooders were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers as main factors.
Pyongyang did not publicly express himself to this.
The vast majority of the floods from the north are eventually offered to South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flee China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China is more likely to view the floods as illegal immigrants than refugees and often leads them back by force.
The relations between the north and the south, which are technically still in the state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two heads of state in Pyongyang met for talks about the decontamination negotiations set up.
This was due to the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they generally agreed to work on a self-proclaimed Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without trusting in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves at first,” said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh \"hysterical\" and says he is not suitable for the office of the Supreme Court
The minority leader in Nancy Pelosi’s House of Representatives called Judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was unfit for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t resist the impression that a woman who had acted like this would have been referred to as hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate’s Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh filed in an emotional way all accusations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes he cried and stood in tears shortly before speaking about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the charges against him a “great and coordinated call-out” organised by Liberals who were angry over Hillary Clinton’s lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believes that Kavanaugh’s statement proves that he cannot serve at the Supreme Court, as she shows that he was in favour of Democrats.
“I believe that he has declared himself unsatisfied with these statements and the way he came to terms with the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to depose Kavanaugh from the office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say so much: if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judicial positions,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi went on to say that as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible decisions by Kavanaughs against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion principle decision Roe v. Wade, as he is judged as a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh asked whether he would review certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need a hysterical, preeminent person now who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘I’m not wonderful’, Pelosi said.
Women need to use it as a weapon.
It is a sincere hate speech, months, and years of overwhelming anger and she doesn’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s rare, and you.”
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was somewhere manager and said that she also cried when she became angry but developed a technique. When she became angry and started to cry, she said to the person to whom she said: “You might think that’s sad because I cry.
I Am Angry
And then just talk about it.
I found the genius.
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, in part because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I wept because of an indescribable rage and was packed by an older woman, an undercooled manager, before whom I had always had a little fear, at the collar and pulled into a stairway.
“Never let them see that you are crying,” she told me.
“You don’t know that you’re smarter.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with themselves as they believe you have gone to the substance.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Colorado congressman, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacies.
In 1987, when Heart aboard a ship called Monkey Business was caught at an extraordinary affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to take into account the idea of presidential candidacy himself.
“That wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow White and the Seven Phrases’.
Since the election campaign had already advanced, it was behind the middle of its creation, and it vowed not to run if it was not to get $2 million.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000, supported her campaign with only $250.
“I believe that I get a discount,” she asked herself.
In the speech in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration over the system that made the middle creation and the direct address of the electorate so difficult, rather than the delegates, as well as the anger over sexism, that she was so overwhelmed that she stood near the tears.
“You could have assumed that I’ve suffered a nerve breakdown — Schroeder remembers the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the bag cloth manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I still remember wondering what they would write on my gravestone.
\"She Weeped\"
Why Beijing could benefit from the trade war between the United States and China
The opening ointments of the trade war between the United States and China were ear-catching. Although the battle has not been over for a long time, Beijing could benefit from a grave between the countries in the long run, my experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, set fire to the first warning committee early in the year when he established important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminum, with penalty duties.
The most important escalation took place this week with new criminal duties on goods worth $200 billion, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China to the United States.
Beijing struck back every time in the same way and recently raised fines of five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China vows to respond to any measure taken by the United States and it is unlikely that the world’s second largest economic power will soon collapse.
Washington to move in, would mean giving up, but a public knock on the U.S. would be far too tempting for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, my experts believe that if Beijing plays out its cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized,” says Abigail Grace, a scientific employee who focuses on Asia at the think factory Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by the seven-year war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that conditions in the country improve.
“Today, the situation on the ground thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism is more stable and secure,” he said.
The government rebuilt the areas destroyed by terrorists to allow normality to return.
All conditions have now been given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave due to terrorism and one-sided economic measures aimed at their everyday lives and living grounds.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
More than six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomed aid in rebuilding the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that no aid services associated with conditions would be accepted by countries that supported the uprising.
Europe won a victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National near Paris.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and won no Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over much of the tournament, lowered his defeat on the 16th train (Par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world’s best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against England’s Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, veteran from eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Of course I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas has chosen me and believed in me.
I am so very happy to win back the pokal.
It's about the team and I'm happy to have made a contribution - the emotional Garcia after European victory.
He continues to reach his countryman John Rahm, who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in the individual encounters.
I am so proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, which I have been pursuing since my childhood on television, according to the 23-year-old Rahma.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup ball of 13-21-3.
A remarkable statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 important titles and will only be surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems finding the Fairways throughout the weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who held high performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of the boys, they’ve been successful.
There was a time this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We didn't do anything about it.
Get off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players had a good performance.
We will regroup ourselves, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated -
