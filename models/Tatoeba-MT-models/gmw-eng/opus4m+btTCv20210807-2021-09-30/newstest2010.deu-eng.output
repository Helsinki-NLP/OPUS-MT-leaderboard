Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. President
U.S. President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
In addition, he is awarded the diploma as well as the medal and a check for $1.4 million for his exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the north-west metropolitan and will be busy all the time.
He first made a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he met with the five committee members for the first time, who elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The couple of presidents then arranged a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will reach its climax with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestige award.
He receives it as the fourth U.S. president, but only as the third to take the prize directly in office.
The White House has already claimed that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan War when it comes to the award.
The President does not want to escape this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently leading war in two countries.
The war efforts he made a few days ago were strengthened by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to donate for benevolent purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event program then provides a banquet with the president and his wife, where outside of Norway’s king and queen, the Prime Minister and other 250 invited guests will also be present.
Obama was very reluctant from the beginning to the prize.
He, for example, indicated that he felt that he did not deserve the prize at all.
He also repeated several times that the price is not just for him, but for those who strive for the same values as he did.
Immediately after the announcement, he revealed that this is for him “calling for action”.
Nature protector is accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz Police accused the president of the civil society - the Leitmeritz National Protection Community - of extortion.
In several cases, he introduced calls against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his vocations, he requested money from the investors for his favors, said the Spokesperson, Alena Romova.
The Chairman of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutz-Communist Lubomir Studnicka.
He is now in prison and is threatening him with a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting trash containers in Brünn don't smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packagings, in the southern Moravian localities you can find again step by step and third the sorting trash container.
And in Brünn?
There you would need to add a few minutes to find the suitable garbage tones.
I don't want to claim that the waste separation in Brünn would not work at all.
But it seems to me that even if the councillors are concerned about this problem, we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is located in the separations in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens are allowed to always deliver only paper, glass and plastics here in the sorting containers, but mainly because of the number of trash tons for such wastes.
Have they ever tried in the center, for example, to remove the PET bottles in a collection basket?
This is art, it takes time and energy for all of us.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the mercenary site opposite the found gans.
Mr. Unterka's colleagues should not be upset, but this is a lot too little for me.
Apart from the fact that the separation of waste in other parts is not a honey leak.
So, many of my friends don't like to sort the waste.
Because of falsity.
It is too far from them to waste.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered to deliver a few glass and plastic bottles after the celebration.
But on the Konicova Street, I have not seen any color waste tones in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place on the road.
But the garbage ran almost over.
That's still the center of Brünn, which represents the whole city, isn't it?
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics are likely to leave the Brunner Socialists cold.
You prefer to buy an ice hockey league that harms us throughout the Republic rather than buy a few garbage tones more and offer the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brown.
I'm happy that I could also confirm my adoption with official statistics after a while on the internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brünn is the worst in the entire district of South Mora.
The 'Paroubek'Budge has withdrawn the money for pensions and sick money
After the left-wing party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government’s view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, health care and construction savings business.
But neither for state debt rates nor for international court disputes.
This causes even more problems that will be to the government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists have imposed the wage increase on some groups, they expect that the government will also secure the money for sensitive spending, pensions, or health care. “This is just a push-off of the problems in the future, mining,” Janota says.
Of the loans, more and more interest rates are paid, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose where to take, the state cash is empty.
If social services or costs for the state operation are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all those the left-wing party now gave more money: the firefighter, the teachers, the farmers.
And later on for their children.
In order for the pensions or the sick money whose account has disappeared 1.8 billion, people don’t have to be afraid, they get that money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - the next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state cash, but much more.
Despite the efforts of the Minister Janota, debt will increase faster and, together with it, the costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money for compensation, then it will no longer be sufficient to raise slavery only slightly or to cut the motherhood money, as the government did in its counter-infringement package.
Because of the money loss in favor of some electoral groups, five billion of the highways and railways will be missing next year.
It is mainly the sections won in competition that can no longer be re-projected and possibly compensated.
Get the highest, which is also not free.
This means delaying or setting up thirty major buildings, which is also at risk of Europe’s spending resources, warns the Minister of Transport, Charles Hanzelka.
The CSSD has suggested that it solves the outflow of money salomonically - it attacks the CEZ stock dividends, where the state is the owner of the majority, and from which the money is then distributed into the transport funds.
The problem is that the height of the dividend is never safe and it is not at all an infinite source.
Last year, CEZ raised 18 billion people to the budget.
Every year, the dividends pay the environmental damages liquidations, the pension account is filled, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, according to EU rules, the actual budget deficit increases to the Niveau of 5.7 percent GDP.
However, this does not end the nuclear revolution.
Almost three billion have lowered the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and criminal offences or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether or not the state can afford this money is not certain.
That's pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, we have to pay for it anyway, Janota explains.
The Minister must then save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already-established two-billion-year-old project, State Treasure, which will allow you to monitor on-line for what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
Should the Minister of Finance not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will dominate two operating systems
For the future, Americans expect a mobile phone on which the user can switch by pressing a single key between different operating systems.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press just one key, and Windows Mobile will be in an Android switch within seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to imagine, focusing primarily on the development of the virtual software for the computer.
We allow you to run two user profiles on the mobile phone at the same time.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, said Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and first presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully launched the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which, in parallel, the mentioned systems ran Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full use.
Now VMware is working with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and customers are expected to come through the year 2012.
Snow lacking on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Sceneless pistes not only worry the giant but residents.
The missing snow also deters people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That’s why you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year’s Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if in our opinion this year’s Christmas will be on snow or “on matsch,” the information portal operator Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, said.
Anyone who wants the Silvester stopover in the spindle mill just after his ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Those who prefer saving and where the quality of the stay comes first in second place who can try to wait for a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now mainly offer weekly stays for the New Year's Day.
I think they'll still be trying to sell them for a while, but then they'll have to go after them, and go in at shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, estimated Jandura.
Free beds on all winter dates always offer the Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in Christmas, which has not yet been sold out.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have prepared some more affordable Christmas stays for the last moment, led by the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi Travel Office can also offer the New Year’s Eve in huge numbers, but there are less free places here.
Good paragraph will also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates will be sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that snow is not always in large mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, the Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely and slightly better than last year, rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou can be occupied.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On Saturday and Christmas, we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
At the central parking lot in Janske Lazne, the hotel Omnia is also occupied by 80 percent for the Silvester stays.
On Christmas Day, half of the beds remain free at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
This year, we were surprised by the fact that we are already about 60 percent occupied.
A bit weaker is now in February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in the stays in the giant terrain is certainly also increasing, the director of the Omnia hotel, Erik Sporysch, said.
In the meantime, the giant air-conditioned hotel owners are waiting for a larger snowstorm.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it comes to defeat, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, a warming will come again, Jiri Jakuvsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeating is Mother of Wisdom
It’s almost funny with which student strive Barack Obama, the president with his call of the wise, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question, which he himself considered stupid.
When he finally swissed out his eagerly anticipated Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he had written them over the copy paper from the Busch-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use in the text several times, as in Iraq, but he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: “New forward path” without ceasing.
Three years ago, he even criticized the Bush Idee - fresh troops contingents in the Iraq plagued by the Civil War - as \"unresponsive and karastrologic decision\" in their wakes.
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, coming from military recommendations, was the only possible and to the extent that it was very successful to speak no more in the news of Iraq today.
Bush’s reputation was not improved by this, for objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than it was to expect.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat.
In order to raise the army contingent, the military again asked him, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, in spite of the subordinating habits, harshly criticized the smuggling guards in the White House.
He called on 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation for better.
The President delayed three months, but did not come to a better idea, and so he would have cheated on the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the promise for another 5,000, even though he himself originally calculated at least 10,000.
The most problematic of all Obama’s strategy is his project to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and to complete this process within three years.
Some doubt that half the increase will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the brother's war of recent years, the Iraq society is relatively well structured, their leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication - no one can rely on it and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are accustomed to changing their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even though they have been formally established correctly, remain only buildings behind which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the uncertainty of the conditions that further complicated Pakistan and Iran's influences.
The building of a “activable state” which is the minimalistic goal of the entire operation is also very unrealistic.
Time-horizont of the Obama strategy restrained by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and now it is at the edge of the explosion.
It is believed that the little soldiers who broke into the cry of war about the ‘early return’ can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul that can’t be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date setting for the withdrawal of troops is purely non-responsibility, because the Taliban will take it as the indirect state of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europe’s willingness to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan goes awry.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Coast Mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, a very difficult question arises for the United States as to whether the problem should not be solved with troops.
This question needs to be answered in the period in which America is yelling at Obama for victory withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, each solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only comforter for Barack Obama is the fact that three more years remain until the presidential election, and therefore enough time remains left for him to get to another strategy, it would prove to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs manager no longer gets premium bonuses in bar
The leading leaders of the U.S. Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which responds to the sharp criticism of its pay practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from managers in the event of excessive risk.
According to the Reuters Agency, Goldman Sachs is at the top of efforts to connect Wall Street’s premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is aware of the continuing direction in which it has to go, led the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made himself the target disc of criticism after spending almost $17 billion on premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion in spite of the measure shown today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector became the hottest political issue with the start of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
The UK reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the bankers’ bonuses, which exceed 25,000 pounds, once with a 50 percent tax.
Similar steps are also preparing France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all fields, except in physics.
Five record women in Stockholm today have taken over from the hands of the king of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf this year's Nobel Prizes in the professional categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, among them was the German writer Romanian origin, Herta Müller, among them.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with her countryman Jack Szostak, for research in the chromosone range.
The award for chemistry has been given by Israeli Ada Jonath, along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarification of the ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson have received for analysis of the economic report.
The only professional category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, this award has been awarded by the scientists Charles Kao for the research in the glass fiber sector and George Smith, along with Willard Boyl, for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chamberas, fax devices or astronomical remote tubes.
Each of these prize winners has received the diploma, Nobel Medal and certificate on the acquisition of the prize of money.
It is ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prize winners in each category, the money price is divided among them.
According to tradition, American President Barak Obama has already received the most expected Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo in the afternoon.
He has acknowledged in his speech the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his way, and is also at the top of the country that leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policies, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for fighting world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him to the castle
On Friday, President Vaclav Klaus received the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in the government, because he disagrees with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Parliament on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the Etat deficit is too high, which also further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was held by the Presidential Speaker, Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Premier, Jan Fischer, on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which now receives Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should have an deficit of 163 billion crowns.
However, on Wednesday, the left-party proposals on money conversion were adopted and the money raised for state officials, for the maintenance of social services and direct wages of farmers.
The government has upheld the social democracy proposals that cover the budget deficit.
Between the left-wing party on one side and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, on the other hand, a sharp inner political dispute was created, as a result of which the question of the further work of the fishing official cabinet was raised, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, has virtually liquidated the package of savings measures that have been implemented on the part of the fishing government in the autumn, and that, after their understanding, will end the state debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but does not have to, today, in the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs, explained that politicians have neglected the “serious problem - which is “the unsustainable deficit” of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no better solution today.
An improvement could only bring a strong government that could still build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, revealed that the budget is gruesome, and the government should weigh its further existence.
The ODS seat chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party apparently no longer works.
In the editorial, Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words as \"strong expressions\"
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the Etat deficit was gruesome that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, surpassing 200 billion crowns.
As early as Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new movie by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film \"Invictus: The Unbeaten\" shows the world much from the country, of its fight and victory despite some criticism that the lead role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, racial relations, and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid system in the South African Republic as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life story American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the one-and-a-half-year-old Mandela if he could show him in the Eastwood movie.
Another significant role Matt Damon takes over.
I told him: “If I will play you, I have to meet you.
The two-and-a-half-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area of the “Million Dollar Baby,” already represented the leader of the movement to abolish slavery from which eventually became a slave-keeper, a fictional US president, and also God in “Evan Almighty” but rarely anyone who is still alive and important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity in the end of apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
\"Invictus - is the Latin word for \"unbeaten\" and at the same time is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak.
The film describes a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, in order to end the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still remain racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can end his people by sport, so he decides to end the rugby players that belong to the outside world.
Finally, the South African team rises to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela history to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role so as to approach it as closely as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, eat with him at night, and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I shook your hand, I took over your energy, it will be transferred, and I felt that I knew what you were feeling, he said.
It is important for me to be a different person.
Matt Damon in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have overcome.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he met Pienaar in his house for the first time.
I remember when I ringed the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the film.'
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual examples, he has received positive reviews under the direction of the director Eastwood — Invictus: Unbeaten — and is also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy, summed up his evaluation in the following words: “This was very good story, very well-run film.
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76% positive evaluations.
The Russians have tested a rocket.
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed across Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense announced yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was being tested not far from the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was not successful again, and the \"Bulava\" rocket, originally to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality as well as the Premier, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site in the rocket test also had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not started at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, one already writes about \"Bulava\" as above a rocket that doesn't fly\"
A rocket that does not fly, but shines
This 13th attempt was normal at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage occurred on the rocket.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, Bulava started from the Dmitrij Donskij nuclear submarine, which was under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the committee from the submarine.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over north roads was actually the damaged \"Bulava\".
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian rocket.
On the other hand, the generality has maintained itself this time and claims that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and the accident was only the third stage affected.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was done without error, the Ministry of Defense management considers only six out of thirteen unsuccessful.
The nearly fifty-percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism and thus it is further claimed that the \"Bulava\" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic atomic blowheads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at 51 years of age
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov once again presents himself in a professional ice hockey game at 51 years old.
The former world champion, Olympics and Stanley Cup owner will help his team CSKA Moscow out in distress, and will likely join KHL on Friday against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career at age forty in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We only need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP cited the coach of the Moscow club of Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only be a game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, co-player Nemcinov performed.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice field, he becomes the oldest professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary stormer Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford for fifty-five years and was able to earn 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also gained success in the NHL, where he twice raised the Stanley Cup over his head in Detroit Dress.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the ice hockey room.
Hyundai gave up the trade unions.
The management of the Nosovice-Automobilfabrik Hyundai agreed with the union on the cancellation of all overtime.
Due to frequently arranged overtimes, the union announced strike preparedness on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesperson for Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
The management, however, wants to agree with the trade unionists over a Saturday layer this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday 19 December, voluntary overtimes were proposed for the reason that two working layers would be worked, Vanek said.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work on Saturday.
The employees will also receive in the afternoon for the Saturday layer of November 28th.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of employees for the proposed overtimes.
Either they can pay the overtime fee or they can take replacement vacations on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all Saturday-level employees are paid the ride money and lunch.
Taking into account that the overtimes of the most urgent and burning point with regard to demands and complaints made by the trade unioners that had stopped production last week, the management decided to cancel all overtime for the month of December with immediate effect yesterday afternoon.
The employees of the automotive factory had been forced to work 2 hours a day after the eight-hour period.
By signing the Agreement, the willingness to strike on the part of the trade unions will be withdrawn.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factories and the trade unions are to be held on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can sign some of the demands and a joint document, they will be ready to lift the strike.
The situation in the automotive factory has peaked last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees were spontaneous because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged Shikans.
The management held, on the other hand, that employees must make the overtimes to comply with the vehicle delivery requirement.
The trade unionists also called for no sanctions for employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the field of overtimes, trade unions demand to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they are demanding the payment of 5000 crowns this year.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
Series production was launched in the company last November.
By this September, about 80,000 vehicles were produced, the current capacity of production is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Chemical discovery: a substance that also acts in “steeled” HIV viruses
The team of Czechs and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts in the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the connection to common viral variants does not work as strongly as one of the already existing medicines.
The disease of AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, patients can extend their life and prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a wide range of side effects.
Imperfect suppression of the virus increase has also resulted in the development of resistant viruses, which are no longer effective drugs.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, of the VSCHT (Chemic-Technological University) Prague and of the University in Heidelberg opens the way for dealing with the virus species.
They have demonstrated that the substances referred to as metalocarborane act on the protein that is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus reproduction in a way other than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the attachment problem.
In their work, the scientists came to new “enhanced” compounds that were prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
The metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiple cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Home-to-home and permanent virus
HIV Protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV-protease-caused HIV virus division, no mature viral particles would develop.
When we turn off the HIV prostate, we also switch off the expansion of the virus in the patient's body, explaining the scientists in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemicals of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe entire arrays of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed.
Something weaker but more reliable
The effects of this series of substances against the HIV prostate have been tested in the reagent glass, even against their resistant (resistant) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the medicinal products used, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its further properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low poison and the possibility of further chemical designs, makes metalocarborans interesting links for further research on the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, director of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemy and the Institute of Moleculars of the Academy of Sciences.
The fight for the budget. ODS went off on fisherman, who fights
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as “greedy” and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its further existence.
The statement of the ODS referred to the Prime Minister as \"strong statements\"
It’s supposed to be time for analysis.
The deputy ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party is obviously no longer working.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit or whether it is his residence in the office with the help of the left-wings.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically disparaging, Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, however, with link party amendment proposals over 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has raised the money for state officials, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
In doing so, the government has upheld the social democracy's proposals that it will cover up the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to have a reserve of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the hall before voting, so it met the government’s desire, because the amended budget is only a less bad version of the budget.
Disillusionment and senselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer has argued that the government still considers the present situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened his resignation in the event that the amendment proposals would have been accepted, the situation would have looked different.
According to Czech television, Janota registered with the Premier for Monday after the government business.
He has indicated that he will consider his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment over the budget's existence.
To the extent that fishermen speak out for the further struggle with budget deficitness, according to Necas, the nominees of social democracy (CSSD) who had made the changes in the budget have had nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to health and pensions or service bills.
Topolanek: The ODS-nominated ministers did not err
This is the case with the Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, has highlighted Topolanek in a text message from the United States.
It has been mentioned that in some ministry there are people in the deputy function who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide to reject the fight against the deficit-highs of public finances, it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the majority of the left that is currently in parliament.
Then he can’t possibly expect the support and tolerance of the citizens’ Democrats.
I didn't think about it, and if it's going to be up to date, then I'll deal with it, the defense minister Martin Bartak, nominated by the citizens' Democrats, told the journalists in parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon at the European Council meeting.
The ODS returned at the request of the Premier
Necas at the same time emphasized that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday, if the Prime Minister would explicitly ask the MPs of the citizen Democrats to allow them to accept the budget.
We do not appear as orphans, we are not small children, so he then responded to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the party chairman's absence in parliament as well as in the Czech Republic.
I did not realize that my voice would be missing.
Even when I gave up the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily about Bolshevization of Parliament and destruction all positives, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will drive at about the same price.
The Czech Railway ends or limits some less-exhausted rapid and local trains from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The entire range of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the day of validity of the new schedule as compared to today.
Most tariffs including base and customer fare are not changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area receive several connecting options to the capital, the railway sets for this route trains of the type Pendolino.
The speed train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less rapid trains will also travel on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, basically reducing direct connections from Prague to Letohrad.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Kingsgraz), a total of eight percent, for an increase, on the other hand, Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains are also lifted on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and on a few days a week, the operation of some quick trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
The biggest changes include the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, currently the residents of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem have to convert.
It is the fifteenth traffic path of the Esko suburb transport system, whose opening thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice is possible.
The long distances to the capital will end at the Prague - Main Station.
The CD introduces more lines of connection SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will be driving in the space of two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers have not been able to travel to Bratislava since December 13.
This year’s account for Regional Railways: Increase by 200 million
The rapid trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, the entire railway will receive four billion crowns in the next year, just as in this year. The local trains will provide the districts with a total of eight billion crowns in the next year, with the state paying three billion.
This year, regional trains cost 200 million Czech crowns.
For local trains as well as rapid trains, the railway has renewed a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been completed only for one year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps because of this, it has not even reached the price increase in the vast majority of tickets.
Changes are made to CD Net and eLiska only in one-day network tickets.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driveway, until now it was uniform for the trip between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine militants capture more than 50 people, the children are released.
Milligants kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including some basic teachers and their teachers.
This led to the agency AFP, which initially informed only over 65 abducted persons.
All 17 imprisoned children were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
There was a kidnapping in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 million people allegedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing from the police.
The local negotiators are now seeking the release of the remaining hostage.
According to the agency AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armament fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police pursued the kidnappers because of the violence that called for revenge between the two local agricultural clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, there was imposed on the right of standing because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November, which was associated with the election in the Governor's Office, were 30 journalists.
Because of suspicions of participating in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
But those who resumed the peace negotiations with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes to the American cinemas — Invictus: the Unbeaten — which includes part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who had been allegedly selected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The co-presenter role of the legendary South African Champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
The film’s launch of the cinema will also sound reactions from critics as well as the public.
Nelson Mandela
He is named Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sachar Prize, then the Nobel Peace Prize together with the Klerk in 1993.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Large expectations are set in the film because it comes in a time when South Africa is culminating in preparations for the World Championship, but at the same time, the media are rocking the world’s public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the population on the part of the black-dominated majority.
According to the news agency AP, the responses to the new film in South Africa are primarily positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the leading roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of his own words after the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally so that, as you say, I could receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the film’s premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can get to know Mandelas' personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects every human being, he added.
Dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book template by British writer John Carlin, freely translated “In the Role of the Enemy”: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people have united, portrays the South African advocate of human rights within his first presidential election period.
As of the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racial and day-limited populations and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also joins the World Cup in his role in South African National Rugby Dress, which he won in South Africa.
For the entry of the lawn in the dress, which is almost considered a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela reaped great ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white public and has thus won the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may be doing it to unite people into a single people again, leading the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only black in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve, that will show up first.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, as, for example, in recent interviews for LN rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to the UK.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switching plant at the municipality of Viskov in the Louny area.
In the fire, according to Usti’s spokesman, Labem, Lukas Marvan, entered six units.
Originally, the firefighter wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is being extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special solvents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer within short.
No one was injured, the Havarie did not threaten according to the company spokesman, Pavla Mandova, the security operation of the management system.
The damage has been estimated to be several 10 million crowns, more precisely, the damage will only be determined after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one in accordance with Mandova.
For over 10 years, there has been nothing similar with the company Ceps, errors of this type are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted by the fire of the Trafostation, according to CEZ for North Bohemian, Sona Holingerova, the operation of households, authorities and companies was not affected by the fire of the Trafostation.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech field as the sole operator of the management system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 switching systems with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred into distribution system and line line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura raises criminal notice for slander against three heads of the CSSD.
The student agency's owner, Radim Jancura, today raises criminal ad for slander against three social-democracy leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravier, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint is related to the company's efforts to operate regional transport in some districts.
However, all regions have ultimately signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the roses, while we only spread the offer over the scope of how it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railway because we would know the prices of the Czech Railway that were completed last week.
So nothing else remains for us but to resist us.
Because of this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he argued that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an accusation for the European Commission.
Hasek holds the collection of the criminal notice for the further continuation of Jancura’s media show, which serves him as a free advertising for his society as well as for his own person.
Of course, I am ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also urge other leaders to do so.
I assume that it will also become clear in this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional railway traffic and uses lies and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he has invested several million crowns in advertising that will point to the disadvantageous step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and wants to continue it after New Year.
He specified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign began with Jancura after the districts agreed on the operation of regional railway transport with the Czech Railway and had no tenders for the order in a high of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train traffic in the districts, he, according to Jancura, was already a CSD member.
The only threat was if we didn’t give up that we could lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a CSSD MP, I know who it is, I don't say his name, said Jancura to the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcals free and voluntary
Vaccination against pneumococcals will change the habit as of January.
It should be the first for the families to be free and voluntary.
But even now, votes report that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The Medicine Institute already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that health insurance needs to pay.
The professionals are also aware of the vaccination process.
New vaccination
Vaccines Free for August Children
As of January, children can be poisoned for free against pneumococcals, which were born on August 2 last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccine dose.
Those who have started vaccination in the past year or earlier must also pay for further recovery vaccinations themselves.
The first vaccine dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child's life.
Earlier last year, a quarter of families had their children infected with pneumococcals.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
As a whole, experts estimate that health insurance for vaccine doses spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year.
But they save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year for all children's land vaccinations.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumocococcals cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brain skin inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumocococcal infections cause up to 28 children aged up to 10 years, according to research in hospitals per year.
Outside the Czech Republic, the child’s forced vaccination against pneumococcals was introduced into about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, it is to be paid and voluntary by the insurance companies.
That the obligation vaccination would be better, mentioned, for example, by the head of the Nahlas Civil Society, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association has been working for the Pneumocococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference, where our association was involved, were not very satisfied that we had voluntary vaccination.
That's not very ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have managed to do at least that.
I think that's the way we need to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumocococcals.
At that moment, we don't think about that at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The chairman of the specialist company of practical pediatrics, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were infected, then one could think about reducing the rate of repetition of the vaccine “in a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was launched as a voluntary,” says Cabrnochova.
The experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccined against pneumococcals from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcals is also groundbreaking in that it is paid as the first surface vaccination of health insurance and not by the state.
Insurance should spend the money on prevention to save them for further treatment, explains Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, is a concern of the practical pediatrics involved in the purchase of vaccines.
After the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors then receive them on the same path, as well as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
Some Members, however, feared that the insurance companies could carry out the money from health insurance.
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy and wait for the vaccines to pay them.
According to estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This won't be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist's son involved in 'Museum theft'
The son of famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father’s museum.
According to Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was taken to his vehicle with trailers when invited to 90 paintings.
It means that Frank Frazetta junior and another man had used a bagger to enter the museum in the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of shapes such as Conan the Barbar and Tarzan.
As the news agency Associated Press reported, the artist stopped at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said Frank Frazetta Junior might have been motivated by a family party.
The agency reported that, according to a police-owned statement, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father “that he should enter the museum with all the means to bring all the paintings into a warehouse.”
The agency stated that Frank Frazetta senior objected to having granted any permission.
Labour defends etate and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and levels of spending announced in the previous report against the criticism of opposition, economy and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling would have had an opportunity to show that he meant it seriously with the reduction of deficit by pushing away the decisions until after the election.
The chancellor also went on to say that he was targeting workers with low and medium income.
Its main proposals include a 0.5-percent increase in social insurance and a 1-percent capping limit of public wage cuts for 2011.
The Social Insurance Insurance Officer
On the other hand, trade unions have protested that low-glow receivers are punished for a recession they did not cause and warned of upcoming “problems”
The increase in social insurance — at about 3 billion British pounds a year — has irritated the private economy, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic growth.
The increase limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year will affect about 10 million workers.
SWORPUNK OF THE FORAB ETATOR
Increase of social insurance by another 0.5% from April 2011
This year the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on bankers bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses
Tax bags for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of State pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates of the treasure office, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer by £90 a year and someone with £40,000 a year will be poorer by £190, while a person with £10,000 will be richer by £110.
The ministers said that their goal of deficit halving by 2013 was “severe decisions” but also said that 60% of the additional taxes would be excluded from the 5% of the top earners.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms argues that the sketched tax increases and spending stops would be compared to the necessary measures — a drop on the hot stone.
“These are big numbers. You’ll bring us the deficit halving and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years,” he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party’s predictions of future economic growth, which will influence the extent of the re-indemnification and speed of deficit,\" were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revision previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - far more than the decline by 3.5% predicted in April - while debt would be £3 billion higher than previously claimed.
\"The Last Occasion \"
The Conservatives who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour’s “school crisis” said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years was untenable.
They added that the ministers failed to present a credible plan as to how they will repay this and press \"cynic\" themselves before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
“They said nothing of importance about what they’re going to do,” said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. “They had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass by.”
“The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them,” he said.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be kept from future shortenings, unlike the conservatives’ proposals, which see the deficit cap faster and more likely to come.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money gained by tax increases and spending stops is used to cover spending for the next year, not to reduce deficit, and therefore argue that the plans were built on sand.
The BBC’s political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment at some disabled pensions in the next April - the chancellor would delay the charge of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra help when people need it most and that the situation is reviewed again in September 2010.
\" Holler Etat \"
Although the Minister has not announced any etat details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only be carried on in the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Investigations said the figures of the treasurer would mean powerful cuts in many areas, perhaps in the fields of transport, higher education, science and defense in the future.
“It only worsens the pain later on,” said Robert Chote.
“The important announcements will only be made after the election, whatever they win,” added Roger Bootle, economic advisor to Deloitte.
“This was only the hollow pre-ab-itate report. The markets recognize that.
FBI investigates \"Facts of U.S. citizens in Pakistan\"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens due to the suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandshab province, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it will investigate whether these are the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them should be Pakistani descent, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemenite background.
“If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are accused of and under what circumstances they will be detained,” said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the authority was informed of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are actually the missing students,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had previously been interested in the house and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
Reuters news agency reported that Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said the U.S. has to \"co-operate with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and educate people.\"
The five students were reported missing by your families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns “misdemeanors” in Iran
According to a report by the Human Rights Organization Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as they have been over the past 20 years.
The report details \"misuse patterns\" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report stated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights balance.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
Following the opposing election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedshad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens killed, leading to the largest road protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Tens of them received prison sentences and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse allegations and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak staff.
But since then, there has been no longer any tolerance for criticism by the authorities, our correspondent said.
\"False Confession \"
Amnesty International cited the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with \"work with Facebook networks\" and protesting the election results.
“They often hit me in the face,” he was quoted.
“I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me.”
After five days, he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half unconscious, was released on the street, Amnesty told.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who were arrested after the election were tortured to death in August and others were raped.
Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also called the case of a former prisoner, who said he had been detained in a container in a criminal facility in Kahrizak with 75 others for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the court authorities had set up a committee to investigate the unrest after the election and the government's reactions, but, as Amnesty said, the mandates and power of these organs would be unclear and the results won by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said that at least 90 people have been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow have been used to turn a landmark into a competition piste in Bristol.
The ski piste of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
At the top of the slope in the Brandon-Hill-Park there was a short jump chance at the beginning of a 100-meter slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite scary.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that shine below.
He added: “There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents.”
Prices were awarded for the best pieces of art performed on the slope or tricks.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will leave the melt.
She and us are still
Can Islam be French?
pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a ban on the construction of minarettes and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-founded and well-thought-out report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe’s most secularized societies — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book from admiration for the author’s last work: “Why the French don’t love head cloths” (Original title: “Why the French Don’t Like Headscarves” (2006), an elegant and closely arguing study of a dispute that the country shared and employed over a decade and still perceive its effects today.
Bowen’s latest book offers a more comprehensive and more fascinating spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutions, which now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls “Islamic spaces”.
He's a good listener, he's giving debates between teachers and students about the questions they're most worried about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it allowed for a Muslim to use a sense-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profanous affairs, he claims, which make up daily life, completely contrary to the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of Imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible to be on the one hand a good Muslim and on the other hand a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don’t have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who surveyed Bowen are usually inseparable with their Salafi opponents — advocates of purist Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia — who today show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guards the separation of Church and State) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may have experienced a more harsh treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who had to make their historic compromise with secular Republicanism.
He recognizes a “sharpening of value screws” rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, you are inclined to say yes, but not yet.
The World’s Most Unsuspecting View
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that marks it melts at alarming speed and takes life with itself that can survive nowhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have become open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, is featured in \"On thin ice\" (original title: \"On Thin Ice - a natural history of the icons of the north, of the ice bears.
Consistent in the complex history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting for the ice bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an ice bear as a brave 14-year-old Fähnrich to sea, who only fought with the rifle piston of his muskete, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears that were caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circular performance in the early 20th century showed 75 ice bears in an idea.
Even today, zoo facilities still typically own a millionth of the habitat of a wild-living old animal. The climate is rare: the ice bear in Singapore has become quite green by the algae growing in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America, and Russia, laying down in Greenland and Canada continues where hunters in helicopters and motor sled Inuit use powerful storm guns to get their prey to the track.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations, the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book \"After the Ice\" (original title \"After the Ice\", Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the science magazine \"New Scientist\", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a fascinating insight into how the future might develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientist nor oceanographers can properly explain the speed of change.
But this is not due to a lack of explanation attempts.
The pioneer journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, for the first time, led to the confusion of the pack.
Submarine boats measure in the Cold War the moving grates during the undercarriage.
A useful supplement are satellite measurements and the large-scale delivery of measurement probes on icebergs, but still a lot is achieved by unshakable people who camp outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by salt water-rinner halls which are pressed together during freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic small wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer ice once goes off, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, we could be...
Marine infantrymen were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington Kranzene
De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crane on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marine Infantrymen, who took the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the national cemetery in Arlington to adorn tombs, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they had entered.
In a few months from where we are always brought back, we could be that, Robinson said, about the fallen soldiers.
If we were to do that, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I try to show my respect like that.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay bars on the tombs of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Peace Court.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the sadness newspaper manufacturer Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this journey every year, continue in various cities along the way to perform events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has expanded the event to other states as well.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crates on the tombs at Arlington-Friedhof, in areas at the Pentagon, on tombs at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at the Battery Park in New York and at the memory site for the United-Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation, for the second time, donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she had taken the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to give back something that the victims brought.
She said this is a small contribution to how we can support civilians.
It's like visiting a family cemetery.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extended lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd world wars and the Vietnam War as they were not visited as often as the newer graves, the organizers said.
The mood was cheerful, children played, and couples were holding on to the hand while wearing the fresh jaw branches to the grey tombstones.
Each round crane was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remains almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 cranes to adorn this section, but the dark mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals cried open, others prayed, and families and friends held themselves together in the icy air.
Some read the names listed in stone, while others bowed down to small black-and-white square cards that had been placed for those in the damp mud whose tombstones had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed bitter tears before her son’s grave.
She was taken 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the graveyard of Marine Infranterry sub-office David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free ..., my son paid for it, she said.
“If I haven’t been here for a long time, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. government contractors arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said Foreign Ministry representatives on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers, such as USAID, the U.S. Department of International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials of U.S. interests in Havana are trying to gain access to the prison, which was arrested on 5 December.
The special charges have not yet been issued, although, under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything, under the charge of the threat.
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Government enemy graffiti and statements are considered to be serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested an approval to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will likely increase the tensions between the Communist government of the Castro Brotherhood in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a “slow” approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy highlights the fact that the United States will be returning when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earned of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has not allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are only used for sending text messages because a 15-minute phone call would cost a day’s wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Too many websites are limited.
In Cuba, arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, U.S. Secretary of Interest in Havana.
Berbena said she could not give any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the issue of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch - who recently released a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled “New Castro, same Cuba”, a quote of Raul Castro’s official deployment as leader of the country replacing the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants would be arrested, sentenced and imprisoned very often within a day.
He said that probably every solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving toward more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives cover plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities discovered an alleged leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hoped this case could help to discover an expanded network of terrorists looking for radicalized young men.
Researchers said they had sought an unsuspecting insurgent, known as Saif fullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them had posted comments on the Internet video page YouTube on terrorist attacks.
Saifulah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and its terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service, who was taught about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifulah could not convince the Al-Kaida leader that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy on the migration of the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government officer, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were not discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to gain access to the Al-Kaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani criminal authorities.
The case of the five men - who remain in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of investors in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. Secret Service has made it a matter of highest urgency to accommodate human active posts within Al Kaida.
The applicants of the organization act as pedestals who do not include those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who might be spies.
American willow recruits are subjected to a special examination by A Kaida, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be a huge attraction to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the highest-ranking analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years in regard to whom they allow access, because the U.S. secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
When trying to get someone into these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?” said Kohlmann.
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters are demanding climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded by the negotiators at the city’s Bella Congress Centre to act more subtlely in climate protection.
Protesters said 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were more likely to amount to about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosives near some government buildings in the downtown.
One day, when little happened in the climate negotiations funded by the UN, thousands of activists wandered through the city with transparents in English, “There is no planet B, and one in Spanish, who explained, “The Earth says “Surely”
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to Peru, the birth country of her mother, makes her aware of what heartbreaking problems the country has to face due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I decided to participate in the great demonstration - to continue the word and appeal to world leaders, to establish a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there's no way around it.
The police stopped the protesters from getting too close to the Bella center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or brought pocket knife.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a viewer who didn’t want to be mentioned because he was involved in climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing fired several explosives near Copenhagen’s main channel, near which there are several ministry.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as a light rocket, but were followed by “a few major explosions.”
Inside the Congressional Center, people gathered in front of TV screens to pursue the demonstration throughout the afternoon.
But the protest has apparently failed to achieve the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: “This is something I was not aware of at all.”
He then continued in Mandarin, saying, “Because the venue is big, I can’t hear what’s going on outside.”
He noted that it depends on the individual's perspective on whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the focus of the broad public and different sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or freedom of other people.”
Test data show hard-fitting racial gap
Testimony to math performance last week were welcome good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the country’s schools, producing the highest performances, the evidence shows that the fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress in the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the stubborn performance gap between African American and White students, both at local and national levels.
The average score of the white fourth runners from Washington D.C. has increased from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), but only rose by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-American eight-klüssler remained basically the same, he fell by a statistically neglected point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data, as the amount of aid was not large enough.
The image over a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The gap, which separated white and black fourth-classers in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score of the children of both groups has grown during this time period, the difference with now 58 points has hardly decreased.
Some district education advocates expressed their concern last week that the results celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were largely driven by white students who are already powerful children anyway.
This suggests that we have raised the overall rating by treating those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that is entering Washington D.C. for education equality.
I don't jump up and down for a span of two or three points, said Democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton elementary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the exam points is that the city's middle schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs that I respect.
What scares me, however, is that we don’t spend the time and energy we need to spend on our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the powerful weak students.
In this fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at pupils in upper classes of elementary school and middle school, which basic skills of reading did not master at the beginning of their school career and which are significantly behind their equal classmates.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum that takes the lead from kindergarten to sixth grade games and life-sustaining experiences, was brought to Washington under the former leading school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP advances reported last week.
I mean, we must continue to work to make the best of the best measures to students who are below the grade of note, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and continue to provide the additional money and resources for the powerful weak schools that are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who is investigating urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could result in political consequences that work against this important agenda.
The weakness is, of course, like with other urban school inspectors, that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public school education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year that is currently 180 days in Washington to compete with charter schools.
One must increase the school year to about 200 days to have the power to change, Janey, who came to an agreement over 185 days a year with his teacher union, said he considered \"a milestone\" on the way to a larger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than prospects for the future
The bus reaches Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises and blinds a moment in the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela’s parents hardly finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was saved in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Her attitude and that of the group’s other eight students exploring Gettysburg, where teaching costs $38,690 a year, was more of an honorable visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
“Yes! I’ll be here soon,” said Graciela, who likes to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
“Wow, really,” she said thoughtfully, when she was told the school’s low professor-to-student ratio.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children attended on their three-day tour and now they have fully received the intended message: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the U.S., Hispanic immigrants who do not end high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but there are hundreds of thousands who receive college training that is needed to get up in the middle class.
In truth, one of five of this “second generation” of Hispanic Americans completes college, which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, have come to the U.S. without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they are pointing forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who study powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for the school and an in-house drive for success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of trust with American schools.
But consulting programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to get to college, especially if these efforts persist over a longer period of time.
When you look at income weak children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in searching through the system, then a single measure at some point will not solve the problem either, Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who surveyed Hispanic students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network from high school to high school for these children.
The federal program, funded by Gracielas College-Tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - a walk up-to-date - and provides more than $300 million per year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when income-stricken students are in middle school and continue to run until they have completed high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students from which more than 60% went to college since 1999.
Iraq’s oil ministry concluded contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to re-build its damaged infrastructure at two auctions completed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only charge shares in two of the 10 increased fields.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has pulled the cutlery.
Two U.S. companies were able to conclude contracts for increased fields in June.
The thinly saturated representatives of American oilmultis at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its gates after 6 years of war and instead of giving Asian and European companies the way, said Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were still emphasized by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the U.S. military probably stopped American oil companies, said analysts were more committed in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
U.S. firms were in some cases disadvantaged because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower pay costs and are more likely to take risks because they don’t have to pay off any accountability.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been sidetracked with technical advice in recent years, have gone empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of the contracts agreed to this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesperson for the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to becoming one of the Greatest of the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to meet its fellow providers and meet its obligations to Iraq.
For the offer of pre-elected companies, orders were made which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the emissions of each field beyond the current level.
Al Kaida's top planners apparently killed in Pakistan
In an apparent U.S. missile attack along Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan this week, a top deployment planner of Al Kaida was killed, U.S. terrorist officials reported on Friday.
This would be if it were confirmed that the second fatal attack on a high-sponsor of the terrorist organization in this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs to have been killed by a number of rockets, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region, who met their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a government representative of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah by telephone said.
Local residents, suspected of belonging to the militants, ran to the scene and quickly took all that was left of the “completely destroyed bodies.”
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two U.S. terrorist representatives led indefinite evidence that Somali belonged to the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of the Al Kaida, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracys around the world, noticed a leading official who wanted to remain anonymous, and referred to the heaviest character of U.S. air attacks on Pakistani soil.
If you assume your central role as given, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He accepted strategic instructions from Al Kaida’s top leaders and implemented them in operations plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali quickly rose in the Al-Kaida hierarchy and established best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second official, but this does not reduce the danger he presented to us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader, who had been killed since September, as in a similar attack Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed.
The rate of attacks by drone of the CIA has declined from an average of six operations per month to two since summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups who have taken steps to reduce their gripability while at the same time brutally killing informed, the site reported.
Leading UN Commissioner in Kabul will resign
The UN’s leading UN representative in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he will resign from his office in March, ending a stormy term of office that was driven by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
The Obama government decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN Secretary said he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concern that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal, which will begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of Afghan security forces and thus send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help in the political conversion of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he did not lay down his office, but only fulfilled an agreement made to his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
General Secretary Ban Ki-moon now passes on so he has time to make a replacement.
What I've said is that he's better off looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the path of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban began searching for a replacement.
UN representatives say that he has taken into account the Swedish-Italian-speaking Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Oath's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and of perverting evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied all accusations, but he also said that Galbraith’s charges — which was fired — have undoubtedly caused damage to the mission because there was already a large amount of scepticism in terms of international interference in the election.
Eide said he had recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures of the American-led armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allow its successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in their money being properly used.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the understanding UN institutions have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, only one person could set.
This is disastrous and should not go on.
U.S. Defense Minister Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon be “meaning additional sanctions” on Iran because he has not participated in talks about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, and played the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good options to choose, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such a development.
“One of the things that lies on my soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years, that is to say, the war’s own unpredictableness.
The Obama government is considering a sanctions package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said that a \"pack of positive and negative incentives\" is needed to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons, because \"his people are going to suffer from the sanctions.\"
On Friday, in an opinion by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the U.S. government has joined the European top politicians in warning that Iran must face “believable” consequences if it does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear surveillance organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said it would resume talks on the restriction of its nuclear program and reject a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed on this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
Iran, however, seems to have abandoned negotiations on provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community in terms of some proposals they had already agreed to make in early October has, frankly, brought together the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way that they have never been together in conjunction with important additional sanctions for Iran, Gates said.
President Obama referred to the 31st of Dec. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he will continue to pursue other options, including those that Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called \"oppressive sanctions.\"
In a statement issued in New York, Iranian representation at the United Nations has condemned what it called \"foundless and unfounded allegations\" on Thursday, some security council members on Iranian nuclear activities and said they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers to achieve a suitable long-term solution.
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki before flying to the oily Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and due to the division of public revenue.
Gates pushed both sides to reduce conflict potential to prevent delays in U.S. plans to reduce U.S. military strength by the end of August from 115,000 to 50,000.
U.S. representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government, “We’ll get your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We won't leave you -
A change of course in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, who told them that “Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children” and “A baby more means a grave more.”
These lessons have taught them so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, which began to change the course by the low birth rate and the older population this summer, as well as encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: “In no way.”
We have already invested all our time and energy into a child.
For a second child, nothing remains, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of one-child politics in China, which has brought forth two generations of notoriety, abandoned single children, who are lovingly called “small emperors,” a population crisis draws up in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time that this policy entered into force, the UN states.
Department of Population Affairs, while the number of population groups of 60 years and older in 2020 is expected to rise from 16.7 percent of the population to 31.1 percent of explosives by 2050, which is far above the global average of about 20 percent.
Inequality is stronger in rich coastal cities with formed populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and parents accounted for almost 22 percent of the reported inhabitants of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Co-mission has said that couples need to get babies in the witnessing age to “help reduce the ratio of older population shares and relieve the unemployment of the future.”
Shanghai will soon be \"as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrial countries, like Japan and Sweden,\" she said.
A step-by-step relaxation
In the country's 1978 constitution, China's one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial one introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who violate this policy must expect enormous fines -- up to their triple annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese representatives have attributed it to this policy that the critical demand for natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of politics.
In rural regions, some officials forced pregnant women who had already had a child to drive off.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions that resulted in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their stance on one-child policies.
In 2004, they approved more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many harsh slogans was melted.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing Institute of Population Research, said that government representatives have recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, to allow couples to have two children in which a partner is a single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posts that families learned to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who comes in for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent out urban employees and volunteers for family planning to search for couples at home and push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disappointment
Although officials from a rural small town in the outlying areas of Shanghai said that there is an upsurge in the requests of couples who want a second child after the campaign is launched, urban districts do not report a change.
The Huinan municipality with a population of 115,000 still receives only four to five requests per month as an example.
Disillusioned Shanghai officials say the expected 2010 number of births in the city will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai community of Caolu, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people no longer want children.
You want to give your first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and this would also be legal.
But they own, like many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West falsely judge one-child policy as human rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, you rob us of the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the staff leader, said she only wanted a child because she was also a single child. “We were the family’s center and lived that everyone cared about us.
We are not used to caring for others and don’t really want to do so.
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it inexorably.
For parents from the middle class with double career, through which the birth rate drops, he said, it turns out to be successful and for this one needs to be selfish.
The age group of today's 20-39-year-olds grew up seeing their parents fight during the early days of Chinese capitalism and they don't want to live such a life for themselves, he said.
Also a single child, he said, places huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- \"You have to rebuild your apartment -- and life planning -- \"If the child is 9 months old, you have to have a way of life for the best pre-schools --
Most of his friends are willing to do this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
UN Group Designs Plan to Reduce emissions
The climate conference funded by the UN -- which has so far been marked by wild poses and mutual accusations -- once again focused on the publication of a document on Friday, which for the next 40 years recorded an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases, with industry nations having to shoulder the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the control of greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the path forward.
But he has been considered to be an important progress in a negotiations that will take time, as more than 100 top politicians from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, which has been formulated by an individual UN working group created for this purpose, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor so that this short- and long-term global warming can master.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high should be the limit of global temperature rise that political decision-makers would have to bear.
The process will give a great deal of flexibility, according to John Coequyt, leading representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-sided document, has compiled an 180-page Negotiation text to focus on what the UN’s leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, called “the great whole.”
It shows the basis of a possible agreement in which industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent in the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given talks on Friday an uplift through its assurance of providing $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to assist poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday still brought the same verbal works that the conversations had taken place last week.
The U.S. Climate Minister Todd Stern has rejected formulations demanding binding reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if they are not funded by the industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama government will drive a tougher line with China as a representative of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign any agreement without the rise of larger emerging countries and taking measures, so Star, who also complained that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his opinion an hour after the statement by Chinese Vice-President He Yafei, who said that it was either missing the leading U.S. climate negotiator, or “highly irresponsible,” from him that he said early in the week that the United States would not help China financially to master global warming.
Because the future economic march direction of the major world powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and the emerging countries have broken lines.
The current struggle is similar to the rescue of individual economies, as well as the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States being concerned because of their corresponding obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of braking the greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved more aggressively to move the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions for their actions to account.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, according to Ulate, who is also working as a regional climate change advisor for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the impact of climate change stated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The Alliance of Small Island States with 43 members presented a 24-sided draft contract on early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who conducts the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island countries is exerting political pressure on the entire political process, partly because they are now united and are demanding measures from the emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks came to a new urgency when delegates focused on the fact that most open questions still need to be clarified before the arrival of government leaders to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister, withdrew from their aircraft and rushed through the Bella Centre's paths to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to cut off claims that will be negotiated next week.
The pure extent of the assembly -- 13,000 persons enter the Congressional Centre daily and out, guitar-playing activists organize nightly shows in which they make fun of the countries they believe are betraying and selling, and contract drafts are hand-made rather than e-mailed -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just up: almost all the important ministers are now here and as of Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the top of the league, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavy weights come.
Britain's first 225 km/h faster train defines Monday's feeling
Monday morning at 5:00 a.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach London St. Pancras 225 km/h during its flash ride from Ashfort, Kent, and will be 93 km back in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin Pendler service from London.
He hopes that Britain’s new service will eventually connect to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains and will connect the major bombing areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become lively commuting cities, working hours would dramatically reduce and the change of aircraft and car to train would reduce national carbon emissions and dust on the streets.
In theory, the three great parties believe in this vision.
But the billions of British pounds required for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still attract the brake in British high-speed glaciers.
High Speed Two (HS2), a January-based company that is to present to the government a conductability study, Lord Adonis will deliver the report on December 30, according to the Times.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway to connect London to the West Midlands will take over a five-metre play area in urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the free space, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also designed to create three options for a larger, northward leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route guide in which a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would divide into or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another towards northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
“It seems to be the most effective option,” a railway insider said.
After completion, travel time between London and Edinburgh would decrease to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travelers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today something over an hour.
The designs offered trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest Europe would be.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation on the London-Birmingham route per hour.
This would again mean that a final station would be needed in London, on which 20,000 travelers could be completed per hour.
Given the spatial restrictions in the capital, it is expected that an existing railway station would be installed to accommodate the high-speed network.
Train experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be continued in his opinion or not, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it puts the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains had to change first from the high-speed trains to existing rail routes in the north of Birmingham, which would keep the travel time between London and Scotland at more than three hours.
This is considered to be a crucial hub in order to ensure a change from plane to train, a direction measure for the rail revolution.
Tax payers come up for mortgage for 75,000 pounds of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading lower house member of the Conservatives, charged the taxpayer with thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an orangery, which he had read in his residence in his constituency.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron, because he complained that under-house members must live “of lean rations,” has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds in order to build an oak wood factory on his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest rate, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The representatives of the sub-house approved the applications at the time and were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducted a review of the expenses of the sub-house members. Last night Duncan said the applications could not have been even more clean or understandable.
Duncan, one of the richest under house members, owns a two-story house in a village in his county Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expense control station of the sub-house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden, which is referred to in the plans as “Orangery”.
Neighbors described him as a “glasshouse for entertainment”
Duncan was also not invited to take a position for increased monetary revenue during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage agreements by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The Committee spoke freely to him last month after an investigation of his spending on the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage over 271,406 pounds of €300,000 from his London house to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election to the Member of Parliament.
This week’s published documents show that Duncan received approximately 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) a month as mortgage interest refund by March last year.
In April its claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan’s RBS mortgage has not changed during this time period, which suggests that the total increase in funding for the money collection of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate dropped from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the House show that Duncan continued to make his right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the lower house in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him while after the spending scandal said that members of parliament would live \"by leanings\".
“In essence, working for the state means that you have to live by leaning rations and how to deal with S.*e.
He said: “I spent my money on my garden and raised the claim of a small part, measured by what belongs to me.
And I could have asked the whole damn sum, but I don't do it.
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil grocer, was attacked for the first time in May because of his spending, when it became clear that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden before explaining with the Fees Office that this could be considered an excessive demand.
An activist, as a protest in Duncan's lawn, has dug a hole in the form of a pound sign after it was announced that he had asked for 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was questioned about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, “This was approved by both the Fees Office and the following legg to raise value.”
He added: “There is no debate about drowsiness and drowsiness or an injunction of rules or similar.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be more clean and clear.
Comes all their believers to admire Brighton's Beach Hut Advent Calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative church group, which inspires spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages with Christmas songs as a theme for every December day.
The event started on December 1st, and visitors were allowed to watch the latest cottage every day from 17:30 to 18:30 p.m. with free flower wine and traditional Mince Pies, with dry fruits filled with pastries.
The Christmas songs that have been selected so far are — I saw three ships — O come, o come, Emmanuel — and “The first Noël” where the cottage decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary clergyman of the Chichester Diocese and Head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we expect as a church of people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize exciting celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and vibrant place and we try to express it through our spirituality.
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated on Saturdays worldwide and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and mandatory agreement on the fight against climate warming, where police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police, a hundred thousand according to organizers, have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, at the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which should lead to a conclusion that could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the Climate Conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world contributes to the climate, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the \"political price\" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 protesters, dressed in black, had smashed screens with plaister stones and hammers, a journalist of the AFP stated.
Anti-unruly police officers immediately and without consideration, intervened.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your assessment, mainly members of Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitter groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has been heavily criticised the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were arrested — without distinction — and has stressed that about a hundred of you — have been held in the streets every Saturday evening, despite the extreme cold with handshake and in seat position.
The more peaceful train went from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters away from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers, for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters have traveled with bushes and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue rain coats, have made a first in the morning in Copenhagen, as you have followed the call of the friends of the Earth to form blue tides for climate justice.
Today, we are going to the streets to demand a recovery of environmental debt in favor of the South, Lidy Nacpil, Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on and say to ourselves: we've got time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, running water where you can walk, as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of Climatic Diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organisations.
European deputy José Bové, a form of globalization critic, announced that he had come to Copenhagen to link \"Climate Justice and Social Justice\": \"Today there are no differences between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world -
The Asia-Pacific area, where many islands are located, which are particularly endangered due to warming, has given the launch shot for the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people have gone to the streets in Australia, according to the organizers.
In Manila, there were several hundred people, mostly students marched in red and hot bandanas in which you famously named the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, riots took place by a few hundred protesters to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network \"350\" gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (South), in Lille (North), in Bordeaux (West), and in Lyon (East).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denies that it is a strike.
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as self-defeated, Tbilissi denounced the strike.
Some 131,000 people were called on to take part in the first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist area recognized by Russia.
The electives closed at 17 a.m. GMT.
The election decision was about 58% a few hours before the election site closed, according to the Abkhazian Electoral Commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, who condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the one hand, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under restless total occupation, has declared its press spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia occupied by Russia.
After it separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with several thousand people dying, Abkhazia wanted to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to choose a choice location located in a school in the capital of Soukhoumi, choosing a beautiful white building with a few palm trees before entering.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian president and the chief of government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located everywhere in this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said, at a small celebration, as a reference to the support of Moscow, in particular with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazia's self-reliance.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented by former Vice President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements made with Moscow last year, such as the one in which Abkhazia left Russia control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this threshold, a second round of election must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Kopenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready, arrested about 700 people, at the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, have demonstrated in the afternoon colds in the Danish capital, which by 18 December receive delegates from 193 countries who are seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to invade.
A stage was built to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators, dressed in black and armed with brick and hammers, began beating discs, a journalist of the AFP said.
Anti-disruption police officers have immediately circled you and have intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitter groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
By evening a policeman suffered an injury at the chin during the incidents in which, according to police, about twenty-four people were arrested. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
“We’ve got the extreme groups in mind,” said police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the orderly forces were scrambling in the air.
Most protestors traveling by train or by their own vehicle from German cities, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue rain coat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the \"Friends of the Earth\" to a first group to represent the \"blue seas\" for \"Climate Justice\".
“Today, we go to the street to demand that the environmental debt be paid back to the people of the south,” said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
“We can’t say anymore: We still have time — the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin says.
In Africa there are rivers that forget, there are waterfalls through which you can walk, which was never the case before.
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the globalization opponents has approached environmental organisations.
The French Member of the European Parliament and Globalization Critic José Bové, said to AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to \"connect climate justice and social justice - there is no longer any difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world\"
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who is turning to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific area in which many islands are located that are particularly vulnerable to global warming has been the cause of the demonstrations.
In Australia, about 50,000 people were on the road according to the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed red with bandanas, in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy advertising.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of protesters have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east, were joined during the demonstrations organized by the 350 network.
In Geneva, several people gathered.
The subjects of geography and history, according to Chatel, are strengthened by the school reform of the practitioners.
In an interview in the Sunday newspaper Journal du dimanche, National Education Minister Luc Chatel stated that the subjects of geography and history emerge from the school reform of the practitioners even if they are not taught compulsoryly in the terminal (12th year).
“The students of the Première (11th year of school) now have every four weeks and the same programme — Mr. Chatel confirmed.
For the minister, \"this hypocrisy must be overcome - for according to him, \"the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile - but, in general, a concentration of \"the best student\" -
\"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientist - he continued: \"I haven't heard many historians and intellectuals yet who have been upset by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminal on technical lyceen,\" he said.
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) are critical of the state’s project for the deletion of mandatory teaching in history and geography at Terminal S (12th year of school with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also managed this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the rights.
On the other hand, the minister replied that there was no question about a restriction on the philosophy of the Terminal S programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a protest against the project for Tuesday, which, in their opinion, is a victim of future educational training.
The Minister concluded that in Master 2 (M2) they are subject to an expert-related examination at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year an approval exam, in which their teaching skills are tested.
In addition, during the year, they conduct internships in the M2 and then teach one year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued: “If you add all the practice offered before the performance test, you will reach even more hours you have spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours.”
The minister finally explained that he wants to offer “the individual right to education” - a “something that does not exist in public education”
He confirmed once again that he wanted to get rid of the school card until 2012.
15 minutes for the climate at the ‘Ecole Normale Supérieure’
fifteen minutes to talk about the use on the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the “Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change” had faced on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in the Rue d’Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP noted, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the Ernest conferences, where experts each turn to the public with fifteen minutes of filmed contributions.
One wants to do something that makes people reach and awakens in them the feeling of wanting to learn more, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years and one of the organizers of that day, said, “The name of this event goes back to the name the students gave to the fish in the school’s bass.”
Among the experts, about twenty discussed participants were selected, even after their charisma, he specified.
“We can talk about climate warming for hours, but the core goals can also be achieved in a few minutes,” said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke freely to about 50 people with the help of films.
“This is part of our role as scientists,” he stressed in the hope that the listeners may find that “the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific agenda.”
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online at the school’s site from December 15th.
The next \"Ernest\" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months.
Payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
The Trade Unions of Criminals have called for a general day of action on Friday to achieve that the premiums and overtimes, whose payment for budget reasons was suspended until January, will be transferred before Christmas.
The 2nd Trade Union of Criminal Forces (FO-Pénitentiaires) called on employees who have no service to demonstrate before the criminal facility on Tuesday morning and to block them from paying attention to the “thief of what they are entitled to.”
The 3rd union of criminal offence officials — CGT-Pénitentiaire — called for a strong mobilisation in the various prisons — on which the non-payment of overtimes, night strikes, and Sunday and holiday charges in December will be burned as a \"disgusting and unacceptable\" market.
The first union of criminal offence officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Institute Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for \"general mobilisations (...) to show discontent and anger\"
The management of the Criminal Corps and the Ministry of Justice declared that the overtimes had increased greatly in 2009 and not all of them had been provided in the household, but they guarantee that the remaining demands will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of the prison officials, guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
“I am very well aware of the staff’s efforts to keep our criminal enforcement system functional and modernized,” the Minister of Justice said in this letter.
“I have been instructed to take immediate action to prevent such a situation caused by a lack of assessment of the adverse overtimes from repeating in the future,” Mrs Alliot-Marie added.
The December wage is therefore low, except for the management staff, who comes to enjoy high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA, for which the 'husbands' have to hold.
\"This is an absolute scandal - the inter-regional trade union FO in Marseille, announces to boycott \"all the assemblies and calls\" to new instructions.
“The staff are not going to work on Sundays and holidays if the hours of October in December are still not paid. This is also true for their overtimes — the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
“In a time when we are becoming more and more task-oriented without more personnel being hired, the attempt to enrich the staff’s funds is more than inappropriate — according to Bordeaux’s CGT trade union.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions. Some are less affected than others.
In any case, it is wrong, however, to state the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes he is distributing Christmas better gifts than he is getting himself.
The American President, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has proclaimed to TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he is distributing better gifts than he is getting himself.
In a special broadcast broadcast on Sunday evening via the channel ABC, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how to spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
\"Santa Claus also loves Bo\" says Michelle Obama, adding that the dog naturally gets a gift.
\"I made you beautiful gifts last year, she's fucked up the president.
“So please,” he lamented, pointing to the First Lady’s pearl chain, “and who gave it to you.”
During this one-hour broadcast in an uncomplicated atmosphere with the well-known television mother, who had so vehemently supported Barack Obama during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama recalled a ten-course bike and also a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, brought him to Christmas from Kenya.
“I remember when my father once visited us Christmas and brought me a basketball,” the president said.
“First much later in my life I understood that I had this ball from him.”
The First Lady reminded herself of her doll house.
“I didn’t know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house,” Michelle Obama told me.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL confirmed that he had been transferred to the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles for significant \"damaging\" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation is under control, although RTL confirms that the singer was put into the artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors “damaged damage due to the operation of a band disc incident” he had suffered on November 26 in Paris, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damages would have required another operation.
However, the singer’s production company wanted to make it clear that the situation was “under control” and announced that a new medical report would be available at the latest in 48 hours.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid \"smelling and complications.\"
Only after 48 hours, however, had a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of the AFP there was no confirmation or comment on the production company.
RTL also confirms that “out of certain sources, after its first operation in Paris, there was no drought.”
The rocker was operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau due to a band disc incident.
The procedure planned for several days was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments to RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday’s surgery, the singer was hospitalized in Cedars-Sinaï in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the procedure.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was just going through a deep valley, but he assured you “no worries” are needed to make the rock musician, since this is a “good fighter.”
“He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was a weakness to put himself in a plane for 12 hours after such an operation, which did not go that way,” Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday was “reacting well to antibiotics” and that “the infection is inhaled.”
Mr Camus also explained to Laeticia, the singer’s wife, that he did not feel any special concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the singer’s health has grown ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he crashed on his yacht.
Two months later, the general surprise was that Johnny Hallyday had a “small intestine cancer-OP” that resulted in a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer, as planned, recorded his long “Tour 66” as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commenting heavily. Fans and journalists have not missed that the singer on stage had trouble moving.
It was not until mid-November that the people who surrounded him had to detain a re-mission to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Shortway: First place for Bousquet over its favorite points
The Franzose Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medal winner at the 2009 Swimming World Championships, won an international title on Thursday, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, at which the polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records while a true record flood was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the two others by Russia at 4 x 50 m layers by the men.
Damage to Bousquet, who wanted to catch 50m freestyle after the world record, whose record he holds in the big basin (20.94).
In one of the two king-in-laws in swimming, 50m-freestyle, the 28-year-old Franzose claimed herself in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight) - a premiere at an international level.
Bousquet forced the Croats Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
“You can believe bigger and in the present case, I’ve said, if the world record is in my reach, I’ll try it.”
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits that were banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their e-mail in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination this time for the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record, has not paid off in the end.
The young swimmer failed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he continued with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't earn a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my job.
“Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future,” Biedermann said.
USA : Zola graveyard estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman tomb plate that appeared in French writer Emile Zola was estimated to be $1.5 million in value on Thursday, according to Sotheby's art dealer.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the IIIth century after Christ and has always been rated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which “four scenes of the Dionysos are shown in a sophistic architecture decor, surrounded by satyres and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world - explained Florent Heintz, Vice President of Increased Roman and Egyptian Antiquities at Sotheby’s, on Tuesday against the AFP.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
“The sale is still running, but this part is certainly what the buyers so far have most offered,” says Sotheby’s spokesman, Dan Abernethy, to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home for nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she presented a piece of work to French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel for this purpose, and to Paul Reynaud, Minister of the III French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshall Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
In searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of an “Emile Zola heritage” opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the “Thérèse Raquin” and the fresco “Rougon Macquart”.
Zelaya's trip attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been neglected
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of the crashed Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil as no longer compatible after this guidance had been rejected by the coup government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that night, everything seems to indicate that one disagrees on the possibility of carrying out this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, said.
According to the immigration authority, the plane set up by the Mexican government, which was found in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transfer M. Zelayas, returned to its starting point.
The Putsch government wanted to require M. Zelaya to 'depite' and request political asylum for him abroad.
However, the deposed president refused to do so because he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcome, acting head of state.
The coup regime “has suffered a new failure by moving me to give up on my costs (...), they wanted me to resign,” said on Thursday M. Zelaya to Radio Globo, in which he has frequently reported to the Central American country since the beginning of the political crisis.
I can stay here well and enjoy ten years, here I have my guitar, the crashed president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, in the face of some accords.
The Mexican Embassy has submitted a request for guidance, which we unfortunately cannot accept, as it does not include asylum, had declared on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of Home Affairs of the Putsch Government, to the Honduran Radio HRN.
In no country around Asylum, I had answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had stressed, would only take place as president of the Honduran people.
The rumors about an exit by M. Zelayas had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the crashed president who had taken up the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, to which the military there had strengthened its commitment.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putsch government.
This, according to his assessment, revealed the marginal nature of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was stumbled on 28 June, on the day of the People's Question organized by him to prepare his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he was surprised to return to the Brazilian Embassy on 21 September.
He leaves this, he is imprisoned for high-dealing crimes he is accused of by the justice, according to the Putsch government.
The Putsch President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to disband M. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States over the course of the controversial election, however, by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street in Uprising, US Trade Balance Feeds Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday with a high, the figures of the U.S. trade balance testify to a price recovery of United States shares as well as its partners: the Dow Jones has reached 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at stock exchange closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 was recorded at 0.58 % (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There are good news from different types of industry, according to Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premium that the market focuses only on “half-full glasses,” she justified.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily fixed to the figures of the American trade balance, which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October as compared to September.
The analysts, in contrast, had calculated an increase in deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The major novelty is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the case of goods exports that reflect the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, Christopher Cornell commented on the company research economy.com.
In return, the unemployment reports in the United States have increased in the last week against all expectations and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average value of new job seekers during the last four weeks — at the low point of the year — was emphasized by Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of state bonds to 10 years has increased to 3,482% compared to 3,432% from Tuesday night, the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4,492% compared to 4,408% from the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of the power-standing Partisan Pfeifen - Ladies in Weiss
On Thursday, a few hundred Cuban-powered Partisans who met in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day, and also failed another announcement, due to which a good dozen dissident was temporarily arrested.
In order to expose the forty women in Weiss, wives or nearby political prisoners, on the open street of Partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on the footstool in the centre of the capital, in order to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist confirmed by the AFP.
Down with the Yankies!, \"Söldner\", \"the street belongs to the revolutionary\", \"It is Fidel and Raul\" that the empowered Partisans with raised-up Faust were opposed to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to ensure \"their protection\"
A similar demonstration against the \"Damen in Weiss\" had taken place on the eve of Havana, where it was neither injured nor arrested.
In the Havana district of Vedado, however, a dozen dissidents, who also appeared on Thursday’s International Human Rights Day demonstration, were temporarily arrested by civilian police, confirmed a reporter of the AFP.
According to this journalist, police have forced the dissidents out of the government’s partisans to enter into civilian vehicles under the use of force.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As a candidate to the Sakharov Prizes awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the \"Damen in Weiss - an unapproved march for the purpose of freeing all political prisoners - has its number of around 200 persons, according to the Dissident List, explained Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda has a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda is one of the group of the 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, from which 53 behind bars sit until date.
The Cuban authorities consider the regime opponents to be “soldiers” or “ agents” in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reimbursed the demonstration events held on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and counter-revolutionaries.
Cuba, led by a unity party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NROs of inflicting rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Insanity kills eighty years with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
One with two knives armed with an insanity killed an eighty-year-old man in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) on Friday against late afternoon at the main business time in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne.
According to the first information of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old for an unexplained cause in or before a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives, and this, according to police information, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is the result of his injuries, according to a director of the Alliance police syndicate in the hospital.
In or before the same pharmacy, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the triples, intervened and was injured.
The two first victims were seriously hospitalized, where the 80-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life, as he, according to police sources, was apparently affected by vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become sick because of the events and is supposed to have been hospitalized by a police source in the state of shock.
The armed man, who seemed to be under alcohol or drug influence after police reports, should have been on the street, just like Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He had hurt two other passengers, apparently by chance: a thirty-three and a forty-two-year-old, the latter of them hard.
The scenario remained in the dark at night.
He had been armed with two meat knifes, which he was wearing crossbacks, declared on behalf of Arnaud Pressé, a member of the syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passersby, including young people, should have tried to tie the mad person according to the witness reports determined by the AFP.
I've seen a guy in the threes with a green west.
Three young people were trying to enter.
They did not do it because the guy was well-built, Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar, reported.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke the wrist.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of House number 61, two city police officers, including her superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knifesticks, police said.
The event took place in one of Clichy-la-Garenne's main batters, where a number of shops are located.
Passengers have come to me to tell me that an injured person is inside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I put them in first-help position and noticed a clumsy wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacy, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about three-year-old person has been injured by cut wounds.
State police forces have finally arrested the man who did not carry identification papers.
The prosecutorship of Nanterre has commissioned the District Department of Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) with the case investigation.
The mad person was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not exclude him from being sent to a nervous hospital.
According to another police source, there were six police officers in order to bind him on the police commissioner in Clichy, where he had been deposed.
He was “in a state of excruciation” like “all the spiritual confusions of this kind in which the forces set free during the Tathering”
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls for a return to criminal prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has requested the prosecution of his clients, who are currently in his place of residence in Switzerland due to a loss of seat more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the “Pianist” has filed three judges of the appeal court in the second district of California gross trial error in the Negotiation period in 1977.
I appeal to the criminal authority, M. Hummel explained before adding that the conduct of the judge Laurence Rittenband, who was assigned to the case at the time of the trial, was a cold running down the back.
According to him, the judge, who had already died, spoke to a prosecutor who said that Roman Polanski had earned a courtroom before he had his verdict, which represents a grave trial error.
This discussion was posted in the documentary \"Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired\" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted), itself by inquisitive prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that the authors of the documentary had \"behaved.\"
If the Court rejects the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel demands the conduct of a process that would allow him to present the evidence for his argumentation.
On the one hand, the charge has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the cancellation of the facts laid down to the defendant cannot be taken seriously, as long as Roman Polanski does not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled the U.S. in 1978 before announcing the crime measure for “illegal sexual relations” with a minor of 13 years.
Since then, he has not traveled to the United States.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski must be \"there to attend the negotiations\"
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants who are fleeing a way out?, Mrs Asayma asks.
In your opinion, “the filmmaker prays to the court for a favor and therefore despises its authority”
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to announce their decision, even stressed, that there are other refugees.
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the setting of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also requested the cancellation of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer be able to be harassed by any revival of Polanski’s affair and added: “No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Twenty-two years are enough.
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on the occasion of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to a possible extradition to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is brake through the rise of the dollar and shuts down without a price.
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without a price in a market that was cut between better than in the U.S. and an increase in the dollar: The Dow Jones won 0.63%, the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures present at closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while technologically dominated Nasdaq has given 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
“Honestly, the market is quite quiet,” Mace said, “silver from Marblehead Asset Management.
“He remains very limited, the trade volume has become very low, and I think that will continue until the end of the year,” he said.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than provided, which “have contributed to improving the market view of the resurgence of the economy,” the analysts of Charles Schwab joined together.
In the United States sales increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two months apart and far more than planned.
Furthermore, American consumer confidence has improved significantly in December, up to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to index preview from the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes were slowed by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level over the euro for two months, thus pushing down the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation, said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost something on the ground.
The bond market has declined.
On Wednesday evening, the return on the bond for more than 10 years has increased by 3.540% to 3.482% and that of the bond over 30 years to 4.497% to 4.492% of the previous day.
Miss World’s election in South Africa
After a month of tour through South Africa, the 112 candidates to the Miss World title on Saturday will exceed the last hurdle to realize their dream: to become the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this in front of a billion television viewers.
During this great fair of beauty, which is held for the second time in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already received their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were selected as Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true strudel of pleasures.
Visiting beautiful cities, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, was just exceptional.
I’ve seen a lot of things and made lots of experiences!, Miss Sierra Leone said with great enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17 a.m. (15 a.m. to mid-European time).
I could not imagine a more beautiful country to surrender my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I'm happy to have done this experience twice, stressed Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of South African summer.
For the young Russians, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchange of experience with candidates and the rediscovering of “the breathtaking landscapes”.
After one month of Galas, samples, encounters with the press and Safari, the Miss now focuses on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as to follow Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywoodstars.
It is of course the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about the appearance here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is emphasized with music and dance.
The candidates defy in traditional attempts and not to forget, in the bath suit.
The idea is presented by a television editor, the Chinese Angela Chow, by the ex-beautiful queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and by a responsible member of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is wise to receive the world with a hardly-to-surpassing warmth and pride, reassures Julia Morley, president of the Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time it cost by bike and local cuisine.
However, the meeting was quite exceptional with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them his hand.
Not usually for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Her most beautiful memory, however, remains without a doubt the exhilaration in Cape Town (Southwest) to the World Football Championship in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise a little more for this event.
I’m wrong with people I could probably never approach.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Championship, promised to delight Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday, according to his son David, is very positive.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is “very positive” assured his son David on Friday on his arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's running very well, David Hallyday told the press when he got out of the plane shortly after 13 o'clock local time (21 o'clock MEZ) arrived from Paris.
The singer’s son, who made a relaxed impression, assured him that he would be “fastest” in Cedars-Sinaï hospital, in which Johnny Hallyday was delivered in Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on a band disc incident on November 26.
The singer was put into an artificial coma this night to relieve his strong pain and to carry out his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by the doctors of Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial coma in which he was delivered in Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection following a tape disc operation on November 26.
The singer had to undergo another operation on the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the sickening changes caused by the late intervention.
On Friday morning, his wife Laeticia attended a school event in the French high school of Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade attended school, a photographer of the AFP stated.
The head of the department for orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has seriously burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer on 26 November at the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had set up the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely relieved, Mr Camus said.
I've heard that you might be introducing a court trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes Johnny Hallyday has traveled to Los Angeles with the permission of the Paris surgeon.
I personally phoned this doctor who assured me that he viewed this trip as completely unproblematic, which was very surprising, since I already had two tape disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he had announced at RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation, without drainage.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well-known in the artist's environment.
He had the actress Marie Trintignant, operating in Vilnius a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a questionable reputation, who has already been convicted several times for failing operations and not forgetting them for tax withdrawal and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, attorney of the medical office, has referred to him as “a man without a scruple” who has to be accountable to the Board of Directors regularly and is “all other than recommended.”
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This stated that the intervention would have been “perfect” and the post-operative investigations would have been “normal.”
The operation “did not produce bleeding and therefore does not require drainage” he added.
In any case, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have been getting worse since late summer, seems to be in question.
It is very clear that something is too scarce for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus said.
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) party will be energetic and will urge the Nouveau Centre party to stop using their seal
The party alliance, which is supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem Party, on Friday responded to an acquisition attempt by the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from the chairman of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, and urged him, under the threat of a judicial prosecution, to use this seal on no longer a document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal because he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political heritage after he had reached the left hand.
The Minister of Defense, whose party partner is the UMP,, by the way, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To emphasize his efforts, he had received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC), who raised a claim to the property of the UDF brand, since he first requested this brand in 2004 at the “Institut national de la propriété industrial“.
However, the office of the party alliances supervised by François Bayrous' friends UDF broke the silence and clearly stated that they did not disqualify themselves and set a deadline for the minister and the MP under threat of a court prosecution to stop using this seal and to transfer them the property rights of the brand.
In recent days, you have made numerous statements that you would suggest your political movement to + take over the UDF seal+, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, MoDem Party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
You also probably believed that you would have the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today's UDF+, on their political material as well as on the home page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, explained the UDF’s business office, and called on the NC party to remove “unpredictably the mention of the UDF’s name from all material as well as from (their) website.”
It was also requested by Hervé de Charette - to transfer the property rights of the brand to its legal right-holders -
If you refuse this, we will raise a complaint against you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they emphasized that “UDF” since 1978 has been a full political movement and reminds us that Morin and his friends “have made the choice” to leave this 2007 in order to establish a competitive movement, as others had already done in 2002 to establish the UMP Party.
The Nouveau Centre Party therefore has no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie Françoise).
It continues to remind us that the last UDF Congress approved the three-year accession to MoDem Party and the establishment of a business agency to defend the material and moral interests of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the business office continues, “was he at the time when he applied for the brand name, no longer a member of the UDF for three years, but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and deceptive way, from the lack of depositing the acronym UDF to carry out this for himself.
Furthermore, you give consideration to the fact that this carelessness is in the best way to turn into a crime, and ironizing the NC’s strategy: “It seems to us in politics as well as in life more likely to make a name for ourselves rather than try to get out of anonymity by, in a deceptive way, applying a name to which one has no legal claims,
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is convicted of exploitation of weakness
The Court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine if, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the eighty-eighty-years in order to swallow up part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photographs, will have to be held accountable for the exploitation of weakness in court on 15 and 16 April 2010, a crime that is charged with a penalty of a maximum of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that in fact there will be a process in this affair worthy of the Saga of one of the richest families of France, where mother and daughter fetter and at the same time have the tails of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal in hand.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The Erbin and chief shareholder of L'Oréal have so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not under the conditions submitted by the prosecutor of Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday should still present a report before 10 March 2010 explaining clearly whether and at which time Liliane Bettencourt may have found herself in a state of weakness.
I think she will undergo these investigations.
I'll talk to her, said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, after the negotiations.
As for the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent novelty (...). The review will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady that needs to be protected, he refused.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has initiated a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, and accused him of taking advantage of her mother’s weaknesses for years in order to make a donation of a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
On the one hand, Liliane Bettencourt had always refused to be manipulated by the photographer, whom she viewed as a long-time friend.
Although the court had to check the reliability of the complaint initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the plaidoyers on Friday led to a large family debacle.
The lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt appealed to three of his client's letters to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), where she wrote that she betrayed the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: “Please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier for fifteen years once to twice a day.
I have never been able to speak to François since her marriage.
The prosecutor of Nanterre once again believes that the prosecutor had no right to respond in this way, especially because in the last few days, a court judge has refused his request to initiate a judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt is fully legal, is not under protection and has no prejudice.
No one has the right to act in their place - the representative of the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to give a judgment after the trial to allow Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager revolution or the end of strategic early enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the big French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been without a doubt...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution said: It is for the staff to join \"values\" determines the best, as it used to be on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the work.
By giving the customer the center of the company the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in place ... although the authoritarian temptation has given products separate factors to hang customers' preferences again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative effect on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of F&Eund, which is even more crucial, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE ( Intelligence Economist = Economic Intelligence) - of all parties involved (...) calls for a proactive approach and a future-oriented perspective - it claims a commitment from employees that completely contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for an operational revolution that would consist in putting employees in the center of the company’s concerns equally right next to the customers.
The very conditional benefit of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire that Orange has submitted to its pay recipients, stimulate this revolution in relation to management practices?
I'm afraid, I'm not.
First of all, because I could find out that all the stuff in the face of a new situation after many moves finally reached the point of doing just that, what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a strongly simplified notion of human behavior.
From the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
Through intellectual comfort, it adopts the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the U.S. neurosciences, which has been known to be widely distributed by research institutions and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to act on the “Hebel” (sic) commitment of employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey of Ipsos strengthens the leaders in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is inappropriate for today’s world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, a revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol in any consideration or practice of control: for the pay recipient, the commitment to the company is only possible only if it appears to be a means to achieve some of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
Currently, only the studies from multifunctional analysis assume this conception of the motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a prescribed doxa, which allows them to estimate by their perceived image of the company what it offers them to achieve their goals of life.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, the leaders of the companies can control, predict and predict their social performance and place their human resource management in the right place again.
Thus they create a fertile soil that is beneficial for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo’s speech: the “Just War” brings praise to Obama from the right.
On Friday, the American rights welcomed the speech held by Barack Obama on the eve of Oslo and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 defended the term of the “Just War” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had mocked the award to Obama on 9 October, this time hailed the President's speech, following the example of former presidential candidate in the 2008 election Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained that the right wing of the Republican Party's face in USA Today newspaper and added that she herself has brought the subject of a \"sometimes necessary\" war in her own memoirs published.
The war is, of course, the last of which I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, made efforts on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of violence; a way to declare his decision from nine days ago, to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the opinion that the president has performed in Oslo’s very good work.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who, in particular, recognized the reference to “the existence of evil in the world” in Obama’s words.
In some parts, I have completely felt this speech as historical, Ginrich, who was questioned in the radio broadcast “The Takeaway.”
The previous MP, who is regarded by some as a possible candidate for the 2012 Republican nomination of the presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a \"president of the left\" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they were \"not free and could not impose a prize for peace if the use of violence did not exist\"
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama gave a very American speech.
In addition, as a cosmopolitan, as he always does, he has “spoke like an American president,” pointing out that the Europeans, like them, are living in a safety blaze that they did not create themselves and do not do much for their protection,” Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a Falk of the Age of Bush, referred to the speech on the National Review Online website as \"long, high-end and inspirational\"
To the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is worried about how Barack Obama defends the attacks on the armed forces.
When one packs the war under the cover of justice, the massacre on the innocent can easily be justified, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left continues to praise the president’s side.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize has been awarded to Obama, referred to the address itself as a memorial work for a speaker like him known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo offers a run-off plan to control international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression, according to the California daily newspaper.
The New York Times considers that Obama “declared the necessary discourse” and referred to his speech as “dark and exemplary at the same time.”
Traveler: Three Marathons for an Agreement That Protects Christmas Supply
After a three-week Negotiation Marathon, the trade unions of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employer organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening, which ends the strike command and the threatening heavy supply agreement at Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State Dominique Bussereau, responsible for transport, welcomed the agreement that was introduced on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second Negotiation night, the negotiators separated on early Friday morning hoping to sign the agreement on the late afternoon.
And that although the three employers (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, it took more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 to the conclusion of the agreement, and the agreement was signed at 18:00.
The conflict “has caused a lot of damage to the company, and it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year,” says Bussereau.
The agreement provides a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (International transports).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from €8.72 to €9.06.
“That’s not very much, but we’re only starting small once,” said Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now required to stop blocking the supply centers.
“But there will probably always be some resistance that is not satisfied with the agreement,” he adds.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a \"good agreement\" although it was difficult to clean up these wage increases in the face of international competition.
According to him, the increase is 170 euros monthly for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high pay groups.
“This agreement is based on the common sense and respect of the employees,” says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) said of “a historic agreement.”
Richard Jaubert (CGT) expressed his concern about \"an acceptable compromise\"
The Agreement also provides for the increase of travel costs by 3% and the maintenance of the total rate for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow, in particular, to address the issue of 13th month and the modernisation of the tariff contracts.
M. Bussereau recalled that “the sinking of expenditures for employers amounting to €100 million was the subject of an amendment by the government to the bill of adjusted finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night from Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for an identical vote from the Senate.
The TLF’s signature allows the agreement to apply first to the companies connected to this organisation, and then to apply in the event of an extension by the Minister of Work for the entire professional status.
This will be “in the shortest time” the case, assures Bussereau.
The opposition of the employer employers can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR Association has called for a \"fraud trade\" because the EUR 100 million have already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but not to eat the Gans-Esser on the approaching Christmas Day, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement \"is threatening to create a large grave for the small and medium-sized companies of the industry in the coming 12 months.\"
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, trade unions with the RATP proposals unhappy
The disruptions on the line RER A, France's largest fast train network for the Paris Grand Room and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris's passenger transport administration), which allows strikers to continue with their demands for wages.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central route (between La Défense and Nation), only one of two trains and outside the central line was ready to use only one of four trains.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced travelers to switch.
Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that “the RATP is trying to connect the big businesses in traffic engineering”.
The line RER A passes through the Paris Balling Room from west to east.
The route section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains were scheduled for the main transport time, and almost none during the low traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no human wave on the railroad, as the residents of the Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less abundant than otherwise, especially due to the lack of gymnastics.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), explained he would be extra — an hour and a half earlier, in order to get to work on time.
The SNCF, which had planned to care for the travelers by staff and orderly forces, pointed out that there were no entanglements in the Saint-Lazare railway station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the line RER A or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or traveled from Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros there.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strikers were held again, while the results were reviewed, which had been classified as \"necessary\" by the associations after the meeting with the leadership peak on Friday afternoon.
The RER business leader proposed the specific development of a protocol for the RER A line with respect to all relevant aspects, working hours, professional careers, etc.
However, this is not what drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (Sud), they require a long-term wage.
The CGT was upset that the RATP itself put its wage-to-charge proposals into clasps and stressed that the leadership tip “is not able to solve a problem while this was also possible for the drivers and the SNCF.”
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting for the “in-depth examination of the working conditions” was scheduled for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company 'ignors the weekend driver'
In the morning about 150 drivers were looking for the branch office of a committee in Paris.
It was the leadership peak that refused any discussion during the strike until date, and a meeting was made after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the line RER B after an announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations are demanding a salary of 120 (Unsa) to 150 Euros, of which 30 Euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants).
The drivers of the RER line, which have years of professional experience, have a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a salary of 600 to 650 euros for layer services as well as sun and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish Party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the country’s pro-Kurdish main party; a decision followed immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government much more difficult, trying to give the Kurdish community a hand in order to put an end to the conflict that has been going on for 25 years.
The party for a democratic society (DTP) has been dissolved as it has become a “state for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” according to the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been unanimously made by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to hang the resolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including President Ahmet Türk and Parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political action for the duration of five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the removal of parliamentary immunity, the Turkish and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The party leaders expressed themselves before the ruling that parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than day by day as partyless parliamentarians.
The decision was followed by a procedure initiated in 2007 by Turkish federal prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of following the \"wisdoms\" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is regarded as a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political screen of the PKK rebels.
The party assures \"no connection\" to the PKK, but refuses to label it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The judgment of the Constitutional Court is between the Government, which seeks to oppose the Kurdish Community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds to allow the support of the PKK to be abandoned by the Kurds and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a re-emergement of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan have led to clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the court’s announcement, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of DTP premises in the million city of Diyarbakir in the south-east, mostly populated by Kurds.
The ordering forces employed tear gas grenades and waterlights when the demonstrators began throwing Molotow cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the judgment, Türk assumed that the court’s decision “will deepen even further the despair.”
“Turkey cannot clarify this question on the basis of a party’s ban,” he said.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
“We are opposed by principle against the closing of the parties.
This does not solve the problems - as Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
“This decision is a torpedo of the democratic opening that was promoted by the government,” said the political market observer Ahmet Island.
“You can obviously get caught up in a PKK reaction,” he added.
On Thursday, the PKK announced an attack that killed seven soldiers in the north of Turkey three days ago, one of the most brutal attacks in the past few months.
The snow break can come
A really nice winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to plan the citizens, the winter service director of the FES says.
In particular, so that its employees can try and master the entire vehicle technology.
For the first time in the weekend, it could have been so far away from meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is working on a precise plan.
As soon as it snows covered in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-ranges are driven off with large scattered vehicles, Brauburger explains.
These include main traffic and transit routes such as the New Road and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also firefighting access, ÖPNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with dangers, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service begins at three o'clock in the morning.
The approximately 1040 kilometers had to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which is better held.
This is why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, \"so the routes are free until professional transport starts.\"
It will be difficult when it snows only at 7.30 p.m.
Then we have a problem, says the Winter Service Director, “because no one is ready to put the scattering vehicles in place.”
Only after that, if it does not continue to snow, are supply and opening roads, including the Council-Beil road, on the line.
The last priority has side and side streets.
There will be complaints there, Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the foot people of the FES get on the way, danger points and crossings are issued.
The FES can’t take care of all the bike routes.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since it is on this fast glow, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatter is on the way.
If necessary, it will also be called by the police.
The Ways of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-fearing dinosaurs: the two-foot-long and 1.50-foot-long animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongate skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle collars and a long tail.
Had the species lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
However, Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the Pangäa Supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the relationship relationships, the spread and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging at the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaurs on one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
Over the course of the excavation, they carried together the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino history
The name Tawa comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an exceptional finding: \"Dinosaur fossils from the trias are extremely rare, usually only individual fractions are found\"
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
After the current teaching opinion, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the allocation of these Ur-Dinos is most controversial.
For example, the experts are discussing when the eggs split into their three main lines of development: the meat-fringing theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, known as “long heels,” known as four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plants frozen Ornithischia (bird basin saucers), including the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original Theropode.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found clues on airbags, such as they also own the descendants of the Theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the airbags, the bird’s breathing is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, Randall Irmis says.
Since the related line of the huge sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight buttons, the common ancestor of both groups likely had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs had lived in South America so far, the researchers followed that the ochres appeared there for the first time.
As a result, the three lines of development separated early and spread from South America across all parts of the earth, which at the time still formed a single land mass as a supercontinent of Pangäa.
For this, the fact that the team, along with Tawa, hailed the remains of two more, not particularly closely related Theropods.
The three cannot be descended from a common, a significant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonner Paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted image could arise because in South America, just a few primitive Dino fossils have been preserved, while little can be found on other continents.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptilian tribe to the dominant agricultural vertebrals of the earth's middle age, it is still mysterious.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and the flight saurizers and with numerous other ochres.
Towards the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relationship at the border spread from the Trias to the Jura.
Success history did not last forever
There are two hypothesises to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There might have been a mass death that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact of a group of animals came to blossom, which had also developed in the trias, and since then a shade has frozen: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto are at the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Teachers from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police premises of the occupied casino of Frankfurter Goethe University hit waves worldwide.
278 Professors and teachers of Goethe University, but also of universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidating themselves with the protesting students on the campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, \"dismissible\" it is the use of the police used by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had left the buildings occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike last week because walls and artworks had been besieged.
Five students were injured.
The case damage, the signatories judge, did not justify \"the violent resolution of self-organized teaching events by students and teachers by a police command.\"
The space represents an “unacceptable intervention” into the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to “deligitization and criminalisation of the protest” and distracts from the content.
The Bureau withdrew from the necessary discourse.
The lecturers call for the immediate establishment of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage, it said.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the union of Verdi and the German Trade Union Federation also solidify themselves with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for the future of its own, says Verdi-Landesjugendskreister Alexander Klein.
Hesse's science minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the conduct of the president and the police.
We are grateful to the president.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to CDU country-owned Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, they saw the opposition factions SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to the fore to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler said.
Instead of arguing with the students’ arguments and demands, they have been given.
The link has brought in an application that calls on the Minister of the Interior to report on the use of police.
New Silicon Valley
For many years she was considered a secret city, not accessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded location in the Soviet Union for secret arms research.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the Moscow Center, is considered the “Russian Silicon Valley”
Significant research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives Selenograd’s contacts with the Frankfurter Wissenschaftsstandt Riedberg had been linked to the University Institutes and the companies of the Frankfurter Innovationszentrum (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed in Frankfurt, a protocol for closer cooperation.
The Moscow Vice Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed planning dezerent Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized companies of the natural research focus for a seminar will travel to Selenograd.
Scientific Exchange
It is about continuous scientific exchange.
But it’s also about economic relations.
FIZ companies are allowed to foot on the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian science firms want to acquire assignments in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the large groups of Sitronics and Rossijskaya Electronics.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called “socialist planning city” for armaments research.
Selenograd (translated “Green City”) was given its name from the wooded hill landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgarter Brembklotz
The size of Stuttgart 21 cannot be adjusted high enough.
For the promoters of the project, it is simple and simply about “the new heart of Europe”
S21 is much more than laying down a railway station, more than a monstrous construction site, which will overthrow the city of the bath-worttemberg national capital for a decade in a sinless construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headway stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were then considered to be 19th-century traffic-technical fossils, which acted like brake blocks of modern rail traffic, as it once took a great deal of time to span locomotives from the back to the front.
Drive in, keep short, continue to drive - so it should go.
This is why the main railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a railway station, which is about half the route of the Trans-European Railway Magistrate between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the heart of Europe -
S21 is now actually going on, although the 80s visions are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that in the Hessian and the Bavarian capital it is almost impossible to implement the deep.
However, headway stations no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern turning trains with driving vehicles and steering cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new building route to Ulm will now be on its way.
National and municipal politicians have implemented it.
The train is also involved because the risks of the largest infrastructure individual project in the Republic of the taxpayers and not the state group are at risk.
The project can still be justified in some way.
It creates new urban space, which is believed to be equipped with a lot of green - the computer-generationed graphics of the planners.
For the rail system, S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the expansion of the route are intended for passenger traffic, which is typically attributed to huge growth in the 1980s.
At the time, there was not yet the competition of the airliner.
However, modern transport policy must first be about strengthening freight transport, as transport on the rail is significantly more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new construction route does not work for freight trains due to fierce increases.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 is indirectly dancing many other rail projects as well.
More than six billion Euros are to be confused in the Swiss.
This is the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion to be realistic.
In the next decade, the money will be missing from other nodes and locks on the network.
A total of sixty larger projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the well 180 km long route through the Rheintal.
Since 1987, the train has been built at the Zeitlupentempo.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
However, S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rheintal route becomes the bottle neck for international goods transport: in the heart of Europe.
The Government Checks Judgment to the Airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will go against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) to the night flight ban in revision.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400 pages of comprehensive VGH judgment checked legally, economic minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The VGH in Kassel had founded on these days in writing that in the event of the construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport, the country had to remand the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o’clock, as provided by the State Government, should not be compatible with the legally charged protection of the population from nightly airspace.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is against the judgment in revision.
The opposition criticized this uproar and urged the representatives of the government to reject a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Group Chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel urged CDU and FDP to return to their vows made before the election to a night flight ban, otherwise to be valued as a ‘word break’.
It's fucking hard to keep his word, Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in a statement on the FDP election slogan \"We keep word.\"
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel’s probation, trying to get the country’s government to come to their night flights with “law perversion and trickery.”
An accurate legal examination takes time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a “fast first impression”.
We need a legal decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they show the opposition, his group's statements on the night flight ban have never been.
U.S. banks pay back aid
The crisis-scattered U.S. bankers strip off their state fetters.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid the aid from the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund to a total of $45 billion (about €30 billion).
And the Citigroup also plans to return the state aid, according to a report by the U.S. broadcaster CNBC.
In this way, the institutions want to rid themselves of the restrictions involved in accepting the money, such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the establishment of high fees.
The Bank of America had been worried about a change in bonds worth $19 billion of fresh money from investors.
The rest of the sum took her from her own cash, which, among other things, was well filled by savings sales.
Banking chief Kenneth Lewis expressed his thanks to the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The fine has helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had raised the focus of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the Merrill Lynch investment bank.
The Citigroup also wants to make money on the capital market to free itself from its obligations to the state.
As early as Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a $120 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported calling on circles.
A Citigroup spokesperson did not want to express himself.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their help.
Fast choice
It all went faster than thought.
Almost two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors forced the acting editor Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the body wanted to vote on staff.
As a favorite, Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Mainstadtstudio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the transmitter - officially to avoid the procedure.
However, it may also have played a role in not further harming ZDF-Intensive Markus Schachter, but this proposal should also not be carried out by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächterskandik, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not yet fixed at the editorial conclusion of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter, with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years, failed in the Board of Directors.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's election was a fall for shadows, but an unexpected one.
Because the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election that Brender did not want to confirm in office.
Organized the resistance against the editor-in-chief of Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that according to Brender, the ZDF’s news messages would have lost to turn-on quotas, he rejected another term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there was protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was cast.
At last, 35 state lawmakers had even joined the debate, which the process Kochs regarded as constitutionally unconstitutional.
It has nothing to do with it.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education, and romance.
He then worked on the southwestern radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to the \"Today's Journal\"
The following stations: 1988 to 1990, personal representative of the editor-in-chief; 1991-98 correspondent in Washington; to 1998 director and Moderator of the 'Morgen Magazine' until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF headquarters studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the election of Brenders, who was still elected by the media newspaper Medium Magazine on Wednesday, as a journalist of the year.
Koch’s opposition to the Board of Directors, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Agreement so that the interested person’s proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a withdrawal of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender's expected successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a smart check-up by severely criticising the body immediately after Brender's election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistal independence, he was able to nominate both shadows without losing face for the position of editor-in-chief and the board of directors without getting into the suspicion of having a partygoer in office.
In party Arithmetics, Frey is expected to pay the left-wing liberals.
Study is depleted
Success for the students: After a year of the educational strike, the cultural ministers of the countries finally intervened on Thursday: At a meeting of Culture Minister and University Rector Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future as well.
In each case, they agreed to reduce the testing burdens: in principle, each study module should only be completed with a single test.
In addition, the student's work burden is to be reviewed and \"a realistic and representative measure\" is to be ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam performance between the universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed to making common structural requirements for bachelor's and master's degree programmes more flexible.
There should be no other country rules beyond that.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Cultus Minister and Uni-Rectors have carried the winged word from the better studyability in their mouths.
For the first time, it was filled with a concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of tests in part dramatically: “Every module usually ends with just one exam,” it means in a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially re-regulate the approval of studies.
With the ‘significant reduction in the test load’, the Accreditation Council chairman Reinhold Grimm declared that a ‘fell development content was offered that significantly affected studyability’.
In addition, the 'studiability - in the future - of the crucial criterion - is intended to be in the design.
Modules such as content are \"struggle to check\" whether \"necessary agreement\" between the students when choosing the
Events - avoid them.
The students would have \"a claim to receive playrooms that enable and promote their own initiative\"
The rules should apply to the admission of new, but also to the examination of existing programmes.
These must be “recredited” every five years, however, which means that it will take until 2015 until all programmes have been reviewed.
For this purpose, ten accreditation agencies are nationally subject to the Accreditation Council established by the countries.
In October, the Minister of Culture asked the countries — with emphasis on — to influence the agencies so that the filling of matter is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual federal countries, universities and specialist schools have already agreed on appropriate measures with the State Ministries.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has added funds for the development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, the universities should primarily set up tutor programs and strengthen study counselling as well as examination and foreign offices.
Country and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce a novel of the Higher Education Act into Parliament.
Only a single test is required for the completion of a study model.
Study design should become more flexible and ensure recognition of performance evidence at other universities and facilitate access to the Master.
By the end of the year, all programs of the country should be checked for their studyability.
The government and opposition had once again argued over the study conditions in the country on Thursday.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of Juso-Hochschulegruppes called for the design of educational policy to be done in the future, no longer ‘closed doors’ of the ministers and university principals.
At the end of the education strike, students should now also be treated as affected — a word misbehaves.
The future academics received support from the president of the University Rectors Conference (HRK), Margret Winter Mantel: “We need the experience of the students,” she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Minister of Culture, with whom the HRK consults on a joint reform paper.
The trade union education and science (GEW) did not go far enough in total: it requires a legal claim that allows each graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a further master’s degree.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that enough master’s studies are available tomorrow for today’s generation of bachelor’s students with full-time study conditions, according to GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The countries need to set a lot more lecturers.
However, for freer access to the Master, the Minister of Culture did not express itself.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and coming out is almost no control... - is the initial line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner, in which this dissident’s speech is the subject of the arrival experience of a dissident who has won freedom, but at the same time lost his language space.
Born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, Werner Söllner had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children’s book publisher before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetic lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
On Tuesday, during a meeting in Munich, he took care of a significant extraliterary interest in German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of their securiate acts.
Söllner apparently left a statement in front of Romanian German writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, in his work as IM for the Romanian Secret Service Securitate.
Together with some of the present, Söllner had received the German Language Award in 1989.
The advertising attempts had begun sleuchingly, first in 1971.
I am, closed Söllner, “so someone who hasn’t been able to defend himself against deterrent attempts by the Securitate.”
The lyrician Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
At the same time as the Nobel Prize celebration for Herta Müller and its unparalleled literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literature scene and in particular the community of the German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that identifies the foundations and the downturn of a political system based on monitoring and dominating.
Werner Söllner is, as far as you can tell, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
In his secure act, IM Walter played a role, according to the statement Sölllers of literary scientist Michael Markel, referring to the positive influence of the IM Walter for him.
He made it in all the different points for him at the time, so Markel said.
It is a moral need for him to make this comment.
Söller's explanation was unexpected in the form and before this audience, but it is not surprising that a former dissident and his collaboration with the Romanian secret service is a confession.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Secure Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July in time after reading her own act, 914 pages.
The affected person may be suspected of being speculated, and in some cases may also have known what clear name is behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the very process-proof view of the Stasi acts in this country, dealing with the behinds of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
A systematic enlightenment has been driven back and forth over the past few years.
One of the Birthler officials of the relevant National Council for the Upworking of the Securitate Acts (CNSAS) was founded in 1999, but the release of the files has since been rather sloppy.
Only since 2005 has there been a law that regulates the management of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very great, following the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview was made in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar was said to be a waste of money about the prize-winner.
You have a psychosis, and you have just interrogated them once.
The infamy of power here meant to be able to express itself totally unhindered in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, Söllner’s case, as so often in connection with a distant debt, issues remain inevitable.
Who was hurt? The particular response of the listeners to söller's confession is that the continuation of this chapter is more determined by a sense of duty than by guilt and shame.
To the healing of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
The Champions League
It was as if there was just an adret-dressed outside servant of a very nice Christmas party on which a sports item manufacturer distributed Goodies when the new VfB coach Christian Gross joined an orange-colored plastic bag of the equipment a quarter hour after midnight to a re-launched C class.
The man with the distinctive glazing could be capped because of the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise he could have also been driving himself - alcohol was not in play, and the 55-year-old was fortunately as little.
It had been a pleasant evening, but the work is going on in the morning.
Or just let's go.
In the words of the first three days in advance, Swiss committed: “We have reached the eighth-final, namely, in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania,” but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the decline.
The “most important task” is ahead of Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the king-class performance in the league every day in Mainz.
And the very once again revealed weaknesses according to the fast three gates by Marica (5th), Dräsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Osnabrück
The Eighth Final of the Champions League (Hingames 16/17. + 23/24 February/ Backgames 9/10. + 16/17. March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy over the full-minant status of the Babbel successor remained behavior.
Not only with the supposed healer, who had given the uncertain Stuttgarter pros in the short period of self-confidence, readiness of use and joy of play.
I went to the players and told them that they should focus on their strengths, and kept them more courageous, said Soul Klempner Gross, the so simple sounding success recipe that under therapeutic babble but no longer had an effect.
He revealed a certain magic, admitted Babbel advocate Jen's Lehmann, \"if in football a new impulse comes, sometimes things that you didn't think possible\"
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week-long injury break thanks to his dynamics, was the very best player on the spot, tried to describe the determined “phenomena” with the proverbial “new wind” and the operation of the new commander: “He is a man who demands intervention and discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation -
Under Babbel, it was obviously lacking in this.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet above the mountain, warns sports board Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart, however, needs especially constance.
Like Gross, players and managers also guard against overestimating the victory against a replacement weak and completely overwhelmed defence of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening had come to mind, Khedira said.
And Sports CEO Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal was achieved, the other was still in a long way.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That Heldt had not been at the party for three months after his 40th birthday even after the first home win, was at the events of the weekend, which were fresh in the form of a television interview by Torhütter Jens Lehmann, which was broadcast directly before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Held countered the Harish criticism Lehmanns.
He had shown leadership weakness to the Board of Directors and had decided to change the coaching to pressure publishing fans.
Even though his free day was cut after games, Lehmann valued as a sign of lack of sovereignty and ill will.
Lehmann’s statements were, marked by pure egoism, held back and announced consequences for the finale.
They will no longer be friends for life, the two forty years.
At the same time, however, they agreed with everyone else that without the pre-work done by the dismissed coaching team, the playful and combative strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had “a large share of success,” said Heldt and Lehmann unisono, and the man also agreed with the plastic bag.
WM Fight in Heavy Weight
Hitzige's Duell in Bern: Time and again, challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitali Klitschko provoked with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended its heavyweight title after the WBC version.
The ruling of the judge was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains the heavyweight boxing champion.
The 38-year-old champion after version of the WBC band defeated U.S. Kevin Johnson unanimously after points on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense after its comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had been the world champions of WBO and WBC associations twice.
I'm sorry it didn't work with the K.o. that everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance sheet on 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to fight on the basis of injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th fight.
Before about 17,000 spectators at the Bernese Arena, the 2.02-metre-tall Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
The 11-centimeter-small Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly withdrew from the battles of the world champion so that Klitschko could not decisively target his dangerous rights.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and just tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely met the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had provided some vertebrals before fighting in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a “hospitable zombie” who “cannot be right”
When the champion was weighed, on Friday, the champion was able to provoke Johnson to move the sunglasses from the nose to see his eyes.
Fourth win after Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After nearly four years of dating, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his “WBC belt” that he had previously had to release campfloss.
This year, he then forced Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in his title defenses.
I've just got a stroke in this fight and I'm physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt of the WBA was worn by the British David Haye after it was able to unthrone Nikolai Waluj in November.
Haye had earlier in the summer dismissed a campaign planned for September against Vitali Klitschko.
His promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko at the London Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin has called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar due to false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Left require enlightenment from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition defense minister Karl-Theodor to Gutenberg (CSU) has subjected a deliberate deception.
The Minister said to the deadly bombing on two tankload trains from September — knowingly the untruth — Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast “Dayesschau”
It is called the landfall: he has lied.
The order to kill was issued under the rules of the International Protection Forces for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had, Mr Guttenberg has read, said Trittin.
On Friday it was announced that the attack was not only about the destruction of the kidnapped slanderers but also about the purpose of killing two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. air raid requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed or injured, according to the NATO investigation report.
Green, SPD and Linke called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to explain whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Federal Government's Afghanistan policy - and whether or not Chancellor's Office, Federal Defense and News Service have approved this new strategy called for Jürgen Trittin and Green College Renate Künast.
Government spokesperson Ulrich Wilhelm gave back the criticism.
The chancellor’s office did not influence the federal military’s concrete efforts in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the Ministry's representation of the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to the information of the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have been informed correctly and completely about the background of the tank loader attack.
Officially, they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had kept the Minister sensitive details.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, it was reported that they had even referred to several reports to the Ministry of Defense, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is now asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the “Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper”
He has not received an answer so far, he says.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not mention the allegations and pointed out that this will be clarified in the Federal Day of Investigation Committee, which will establish itself on the next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see pictures and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental illness and drug noise, the boundaries between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is okay.
If we are in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we may unhesitatingly give ourselves the wildest ideas and imagination.
However, those who experience traumaous conditions in the growth, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or dry in the modern Western world, at least special.
However, such images and voices are not only caused by mental illness or by the noise of drugs.
Guilt has our imagination: The same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, including that cause the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to fade.
Dream-like changed state of wakefulness can occur in the most different forms, in the best case, we call them visions, in the worst case, madness.
Even if triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic depressing conditions, psychosis and hallucinations can still be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or insanity occur when the balance of the brain’s neuronal botant materials - all pre-dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is depleted and the interaction of different brain parts is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and mad thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenia psychosis.
The gravity no longer has power over him.
The connection of madness and dream has employed philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle’s concept of hallucinations as a form of a dream in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, in 1861 established a “great similarity of the irresence with dream conditions,” for Sigmund Freud, the dream was “a psychosis, with all disagreements, insanitys, senses of such.”
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two dimensional and quiet bunt.
The gravity no longer has power over him, it is floating on the roof of the room.
He feels a third.
Behind it were winged devil formations with bloodred, distorted frats, tooth-fed.
They chase him, step him up with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Loud, evil voices dries from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, knocks them to a loop and fastens them to a hook on the ceiling.
He rises up to a speaker and lays the cords around his neck.
Spring.
The snakes release.
This is to be a lesson for you, the voices in drum-fetched choir, \"go to the clinic and let yourself be healed.\"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last one is 2 years back, the first nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoactive paranoid psychosis, he is manic-depressive, he takes medication, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The trug images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population is suffering from schizophrenia at least once in life, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenia, those affected can usually no longer distinguish between the inside and the outside world, which can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
The voice hearing is particularly widespread - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
The optical hallucinations are not rare either.
The affected person may no longer be able to separate important ones from insignificant ones, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the loopholes to a flood of ideas and imaginations that originated deeper layers of consciousness.
The reality perception in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior doctor of the clinic for General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenia is located in the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time, he prepares to play a passive role, he becomes overwhelmed by the events, similar to the dream, and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophores therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality equality is usually not possible to them, the trug images are cruel reality, waking up excluded.
Once in a lifetime to have a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, “but remains in principle the sensual and spatial structure of reality perceived in psychosis.”
The mad thoughts and hallucinations are in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers still face puzzles.
Exceptional conditions can cause any person to lose reality in a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic approach to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neural friction of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, due to a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explains foxes.
But it remains a mystery as the disruption of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest itself for many years at first.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis as they engage in the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medications to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get which, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Box.
Whether Trug images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a question of the point of view.
Box has been collecting reports of hallucinations and wearer appearances for ten years, and last year he evaluated his results in the book “The Erreal World in Our Head.”
While hallucinations are among the typical accompanying appearances of psychoses, they also include amazing many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as Borderline or Depression, these include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and brain trauma.
Surprisingly, even the brain of healthy people is hallucinating under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, so box, are composed of memory contents that are usually held back.
They arise when brain areas in which sense perceptions are processed are overactive or less inhibited; when our brain runs hot or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can cause this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also travel, stress, affection, or other mental exception.
In recent studies, up to a third of those surveyed reported having experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attending high school there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If not the pictures and voices.
In the break it may occur that a sleek boy with long, dark hair addresses it.
When it responds to him, the fellow students look at it with surprise - no one else sees or hears this boy.
You think the shy girl is a busy day dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she's listening and seeing this boy just as she's listening and seeing the girl in the bank next door.
She can even feel her presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
I'm crazy, she's asking sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other trudges are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are most frightening
Often, the trudges are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the lesson, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just presents a new fellow student while explaining mathematical equations for all others hearing and visible on the table.
At night, the appearances are most frightening.
If she is waiting for sleep in her dark room, which is far too rare and too late, she can often not distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming of the images she sees, the fractures or the girl with the bleeding cut wounds of arms and legs, before her open or closed eyes.
Let me rest, she screams at the shapes.
Parents and friends don’t tell them about what they would think of them as crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She has been abductor last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since contacting the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Wahn is also a work of art from despair
If a person is socially isolated or suffers from travel, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Box.
I suspect the brain is then underworked and even takes care of its entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, as a little girl, was afraid of other children, often playing them alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she calls Father, since she can think, is not her physical father.
Since the same brain areas are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, which also process real impressions and sounds, those affected like Sarah K. are difficult to distinguish from the truth.
Hallucinations are also images that cause the brain to develop, so they act so real -
Nightly dream pictures also value box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy do not fundamentally differ from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenia, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their trug images as unrealistic.
Box therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too much consciousness-centered world, imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician at Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, painful disease, but it also brings positive, creative - madness is also a work of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of trauma-changing guard consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams, which the living person considers to be real and which he can’t distinguish from the awake state in the aftermath.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralyzing at full consciousness.
If a person is threatened by self and world loss, for example by persistent, complete mobility of movement, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with a separate, imaginary world that is depleted by reality, Schmidt-Degenhard says.
A type of boundary state between dream and hallucination.
Since dealing with a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is present in the imagination.
An intense form of sense foundation and sensation in an unbearable situation that enables us humans to undergo their own design abilities, not in a lack of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory.
The Turkish art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his one-iroid experiences in his book Heart Change as a salvation action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart-folding operation with subsequent heart transplantation takes days to travel, while his body is sentenced to motionlessness at the intensive station.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits foreign times and places: he experiences himself as a beggar, old man, aboard a train anatorium, a robot waiting for his health.
He lived in the early Middle Ages among nobles who produce smokers from blood.
When caught by a Greek on the motorcycle in its home country, it surfes with its hospital bed in the fire-snee of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes up completely in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream for Claussen.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental journeys are still obvious to me after years and in side-by-side details.
Even more meaningful and intense than truly experienced.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug noise show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychological box resumes, \"can lead to a deformation of what we call reality\"
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snow break can come
Burda
Children should take over the publisher at the age of 27
The new head of publishing Kallen is an intermediate solution: in the long term, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he said to the SPIEGEL.
The holding is also expected to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children are 27 years old and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old said to the SPIEGEL.
The details of this have been cautiously regulated.
The question of whether they are active in the company is only after that.
The question is also whether they are able to do so.
It is not possible to hire 7,500 employees if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This also affects the children and the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he had resigned from the Board of Directors from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
At first, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, the responsibility for the company's assets came to this and after the expulsion of Jürgen Todenhöfer, as well as those for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, there is no family member at the top of the publisher.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Calls are also used to bridge ‘10, 15 years’, according to Burda.
The holding should also be 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
In view of Schickedance and Schaeffler’s cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe: “It was always dealing with families who had been infected by a capital quest that had completely speculated and thought they could rise to the very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had “no world powers dreams,” according to Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country as it was Springer, and I don't want to play with 'Time' in the World League, these stores have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
This is at least what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a store with an area of more than 1000 m2m shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), in which everything revolves around body care.
In the wellness area, located on the eighth floor, you will find, among other things, viewed companies such as Hedonai, which provide a haircut with laser; Spaxion, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department, which originates through its teahouse with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while at the same time having a fantastic view of the capital, or renting the relaxation area for two hours to put your own “beauty party” with eight friends on the legs and then relax in the garlic or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many ways that Spaxion offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating areas.
The fitness studio also has this type of equipment, auβerderdem there are also virtual coaches who care about customer training units and thus offer them a perfect personal training.
A training unit is started by entering a personal password on a touch screen that is located opposite the devices.
After that, different videos show you how to properly perform your training units.
The head of the fitness studio assures that 15 minutes (including heating up and hard workouts) are perfectly sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if you want to look past the hair salon after training your body, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments to regain hairspray, shine and health are offered for your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10:00 a.m. to 22.00 p.m. in the evening 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and therefore it is once again a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and get their dresses in our wardrobe.
The form of the decolleté, which is very important for the re-exhibiting of the Silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has selected an exaggerated and very complicated decolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona with electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, created the LIVE office.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The LIVE Office (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements concerning mobility by managing, coordinate, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is intended to be developed to promote the electric car and opinions and measures of the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
\" 3 Electric Cities \"
Barcelona, however, is not the only city to be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, activities related to energy and in particular to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative at which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standards groups across Europe and has a wide range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees “a horizon of peace” for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesies of the Spanish automotive industry, who is the country’s largest exporter, “a horizon of peace”
At the introduction of the 2009 Economic Report by the Government President, Zapatero recalled once again the Maβ takes, which the government launched to support the automotive sector during the year of the government.
“Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we today have a panoramic of neglect and the slurry of some of our main production works,” the government president said.
“Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the automotive manufacturers to produce in Spain in a highly competitive industry in the future, we can see a calm horizon for this industry branch, which is our largest export industry,” he added.
He also recalled that the competition plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided 800 million euros for projects from 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The head of government explained that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also emphasized the government's measures to stimulate demand, in response to the 2000E Plan, which are in cooperation with the Autonomous communities and automotive manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows the exhaust gases to be reduced by 6% on average in the new vehicles sold in the Spanish market, which in turn led to a “strong increase” in permits that increased by 40 percent in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally compatible sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is fully compatible with environmental protection.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and drive system of the engine, baptized on the name i-stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazdas 3 is based on their good notes in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its street behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are very good at the new Mazda3
Starting with the front seats, it can be found that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good hold.
Furthermore, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
In further consideration of the unit consisting of the instrument table and the armature board, it can be found that Mazda is red and blue with a variety of buttons and switches in the looking-out colors, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us in part of the style of Honda Civic.
That is why it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, are depleted from the necessity of German automobiles, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to exceed.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can drive the car comfortably.
All of this comes with a large-scale and clearly shaped suitcase space.
The stop and drive system is now only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed circuit.
This engine is a real pleasure. It is based on its fineness, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not travel many kilometers a year should consider these i-stop with gasoline engine due to its large-scale comfort in the gear circuit and its low consumption, even though, in Mazda, the diesel models are the best-selling ones.
In terms of the equipment, the so-called model Sportive selected for the test ride is a special one, as it has a much larger number of elements from the series equipment.
From the serial equipment, the assistant for the passenger track change (RVM) is particularly clear, which thus eliminates the dead angle, but also the operating elements for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the board computer with a large-line screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth as well as the chromed 17-inch fields.
Auβerdem also includes this version as if it wasn’t enough of equipment yet, the Premium package, which contains the following for additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the teachable Bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD charger.
Fatigue
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars of its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, because of its driving behavior and variety of equipment.
Auβerdem can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative on this model is its slightly high price, which is between €21,770 for the Luxury model and €23,270 for the sportive model.
However, as a consequence of this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day on the New Highest Pass.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red tape of sensibility for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of \"Nine\", the stars were shining, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, more than ever.
Our “Pe” as elegant as ever, decided for a dark “Lady” dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is strictly limited, a device with which you can read only its emails without having a way to see certain attachments or surf through the Internet.
It has enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is still of particular interest to young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example only half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success of this, the company has marketed two new devices: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, quite unlike Peek, where you have to pay a six-time higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but it has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those traveling with a smartphone around the world already know what it means to avoid all the data to read his emails once you have crossed the country border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is already true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but my experience according to which one already needs a doctorate in physics and good glasses to read all the small prints.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission with regard to affordable smoking tariffs for all of Europe remained almost unappreciated.
In addition to your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and that is right.
That a small device like FonPeek (where it’s always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it doesn’t have a Wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariffs means that the phone providers will have to slowly but safely rethink and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, in its prices is the download of books and other requests on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without hooks.
This is an internet-able device and you only pay for it a single time, i.e. when buying, and not month by month.
And that’s exactly what I also expect from FonPeek one day, a purchase opportunity with lifelong internet access as it’s already offering the Peek in the US.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
In addition, I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for consumers.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetish Color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
At Barack Obama’s office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and re-elected the same color to accompany him in his most crucial moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: auβer that it was almost the same color - a bright green yellow -, the clothing consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric-, and to this she wore a little growind-shaped stick or necklace.
It is even so far that at first glance it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes differ greatly in the type of fabric they are made from.
At the introduction, she wore a dress made of top and in Oslo of a patterned seed.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with half-high iron and, the second time, a terrible model, but gold colors.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was raised as a haircut on this occasion, and in the previous she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work due to their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want children.
As a result, the study conducted by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women — Fertility and career of women in Spain —
The survey of 9,737 women between 15 and 75 years of age leaves no doubt: 75% of working women see their career opportunities limited on the labour market due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not, and if so, what kind of profession they exercise.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the house, work only half-days or do not have a fixed work contract will rather become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women move with a firm job, especially in the public sector, the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
“The women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a fixed job receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after the meeting, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with a fixed job, who have longer needed to achieve this and who have met and the first child only achieved much later.
Auβerdem also has a major impact on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in terms of readiness to receive, explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account at the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is the higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they only have primary schooling or higher education, were on average with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
In addition, depending on their level of education, there is a further difference between women.
While women with a primary degree are already getting married before their first appointment and having their first child, women with a middle or high school degree do it exactly differently around and seek a permanent appointment and then get married and then get their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the commonly known advertising statement “Because you’re worth it.”
The main performer from Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will thus become another famous hanging shield as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club, actresses Evangeline Lilly \"Lost\" and Freida Pinto \"Slumdog Millonaire\"
For the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey - Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (seemate of Evangeline in \"Lost\"
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London in the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion they all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was selected as the best model this year.
The Poker Game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent, in Poker der Asse (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente), presents the three-line X-ray pictures of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear-influenced genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks a similarity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent does not save from horrors or enlightenments.
Auβer that this book is a delicious reading, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some sections from the book.
About Albert Camus: “In reading his pages, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt it without having found words: the joy in contrast to the evil fate, morals without guilt and innocence without any God.
Regarding Samuel Beckett: “Nihililist, allegorical Christ, he wrote about what he had not in his mind, between power of mouth and ignorance, with an enchanting poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife that had almost killed him.”
Regarding Graham Greene: \"Our husband was drawn by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, the masquerading in her ban, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery were united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that existed to come into heaven on the way of destruction--
About James Joyce: “The Odysseus” was released in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach, which is one of the 8,000 summits in worldwide literature, one must climb to the north wall, on the wall, at which the best mountain climbers are constantly trying again and again.
William Faulkner said, \"This was a comical causation.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of the county's property, and again he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams bore witness to a certain size.
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer recorded the mad scream that was shouted from a bridge from that personality out of Munich, so that his echo to deep into the night of the 20th century drew in his literary manner, which he made in a journey on which he fled himself and with a speech of violence before the worms the afterworld.
About Dorothy Parker: “One day she knelt down and prayed: my God-fearing God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I finally stop writing like a woman.”
About Joseph Conrad: “On his grave, these verses are excavated by Spencer: ‘sleeping after the effort,/ after the thunder of the port,/ rest after the war,/ after a sweet life you find favor in death’.
About Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she always had her depression.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying them between the Azales or singing the birds in Greek.
It is not known any other case where the man was so patient and fell in love with a neurotic, whose literary talent was still much bigger than her insanity.
About Pío Baroja: “What else did Martín-Santos do but try to influence Joyce in Baroja?
What, then, did Benet mean if he did not direct Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except for the fame of that man, that he might put himself on this podium?
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood last week in the township of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people lived next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixture that we took from the zoo and weighs just six kilos, and then they missed two footsteps and hurt him severely.
It is not in words that we can’t grasp, because it is incomprehensible to us, where the pass should be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was performed on the leash.
To this end, a woman who was walking comfortably when she wanted to deal with these people because of the incident, she was even afraid of her own life, for if such a mad person attacks a dog, he may also do the same with a woman, a child, an older lord, or perhaps even with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very usual Tuesday.
The dog has been horrified all day.
Of course, we have reimbursed an ad in a nearby police service, but we still have great doubts as to whether it will bring something at all and to avoid any prejudices from the start, we just want to make it clear that the fair criminals were Spanish.
Our disappointment over the event has caused us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what has to be done in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal fun, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and persons remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
In cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), the tyre manufacturer Michelin has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among the younger motorcycle drivers, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to highlight the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protective element to prevent head injuries or even death in case of a motorcycle.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of their commitment to traffic safety, which “overtakes more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming more and more secure every day, and further reaffirmed that with other actions, educational and informative characters also contribute to a step closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will be distributed in a first phase posters at over 500 motorcycle workshops to achieve the best possible distribution.
At the conclusion, Michelin stressed that the company’s traffic safety is “a constant concern,” and for the very reason that it is always committed to the development of more and more safe products as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles.
The sale of small trucks increases something again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles approved in Spain in November mean a 12.6% increase in relation to the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are therefore the first growth after 22 consecutive months with steady decline, according to the figures presented by the manufacturer association Anfac and the car dealer association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are currently only to be generated with great caution, since the reference data used for comparison from November 2008 is a particularly bad year of sales with a decrease of 60% with respect to the previous year.
However, it should be noted that, apart from the increase last month, the total permits of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but all vehicles consisting of the small transporter market are included: passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small delivery cars and lighter small trucks/cars.
Furthermore, there are still the same thunder clouds in the sky, which attract most of the demand in compassion, because even though some of the vehicles are purchased by private persons, the bulk of sales to small and medium-sized companies, which in almost 100 percent of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
In this way, these restrictions, which are the result of the turnaround of the credit institutions, need to include further factors such as the increase in unemployment rates or the permanence of the poor economic situation.
In this panoramic and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle from the plan 2000E has helped little.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, even self-employed and small businesses have a right to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emissions that may not exceed 160 grams per mile, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Yesterday, Ganvam reminded the state that it is absolutely necessary to focus a special attention on these small loads as well as, of course, on the industrial vehicles (last-cars and car buses).
The Car Dealer Association for 2010 is a year similar to the one just past, for which it accounts for a loss of sales (in passenger cars and land cars) of 19 %.
Support for brake maneuvers in critical situations is now mandatory
As in the case of the ABS anti-blocking brake system at the time, and as is now done with the SEP stability control, the aid systems for braking in emergency situations must become a mandatory means in the European cars.
In fact, they are already required in all newly authorised passenger cars and light small transporters, for the remaining vehicles a car time was set up by the end of February 2011.
However, the European Union's decision to take care of the safety of pedestrians can also help to prevent many road traffic accidents because of their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake maneuver, which detects the system on the brake pedal on the basis of the brake force executed by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers engaged in an accident were no longer willing to step onto the brake pedal before the collapse, and half of them had not been stopped with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, engages in the brake system with maximum force and thereby reduces the brake time and thus also the brake distance which a car deposits during the brake process.
According to a EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents each year that harm fuss passengers could be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistants.
There would be even fewer accidents - one calculated that any fourth accident could be prevented with personal damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency brake systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that recognizes (through radar or camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts to this, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collapse is already inevitable, the brake assistant will exert maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible in this way.
General Motors shifts the plan for Opel to January
While the company of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) was already taught by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it takes more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the page concerned has already given their consent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which is first presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be moved to the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM will ensure that it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American automaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers might be Geely, who also likes to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, who has back cover by the Russian group Converg, is gaining ever stronger appeal.
If none of these buyers would agree to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to lock Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
At the control of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really managed to make it easier by 80 kilos, bringing only 1,275 kilos to the scale.
In order to create something like this, they first rejected the automatic foldable roof, which was replaced by a tented wall roof with manual drive, so that it saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model, such as the GT3 disappearing - further 15; by taking out the air conditioning again 13; aucontrolr, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 liters, so that another 7 kilos were saved; by the installation of sporting Bacquet seats, another 12 and with the light 19 inch rims again five were saved.
Then again, by ignoring the CDR-30 audio system, one had six kilos less, and by replacing the door handles by handles from matter, the missing kilo had been reached.
Although it is also available with the double clutch drive PDK, the sample ride was carried out with a 6-passed handpowered vehicle, mainly on the smaller California land road lines, on mountain routes that were really very curly.
In his driving behavior, only the note can be given to him.
However, the reduction in his weight has not led to the fact that he would no longer be so safe on the roadside.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time we have not been a model so small and light, but at the same time there is also a sense of great security in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete who is able to warm his muscles at a low pace in the required time until we give him orders to race, brake, recover, and then get everything out of his engine again.
The car does everything we do with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is just as communicative and precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the boxster S) has been accomplished and you can even increase it with the 'sport' option as well as by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which has already been used in the Panamera for the first time.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginably brutal, no matter whether it comes out of standing or when it is accelerated again.
The springs are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The Asphalt on the Landstragels on which we were driving with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car ordered the hit holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; and that, although we found in some of these curves of ice in the morning grey and roll split in the morning.
In summary, it can be said that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable passport, as it might otherwise be more rare and in it there is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost EUR 70,831.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetic line Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck strength as her bags of Chanel.
Much more than “Bad Girl” or “It Girl” she is a “Bag Girl”
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many outstanding players in the Dusko Ivanovic team, an excellent triumph with 82-91 when visiting the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra, and thus comes to the first place within its group after the grandel-like performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight triples the best of his team (29 in the assessment).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large-scale dose of use and team work, even though they waited for their victory until the bitter end.
The great matches from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the blue reds, who sat at the top of the ad table from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the Vitoria team had already come out of the perimeter, it was already known that they had come to the field with well-heated wrists.
They were English and Teletovic, mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava opted for an inner game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with peppers and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the “minus six” rating of splitter already suggests that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Despite the clear advantage of the break, however, the game was not yet decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that on their field of play, not everyone won, and thanks to Elijah's repeatedly attacking hand, they returned to play.
Eidson and Pnini played a key role in the ‘Yelves’ turning the rudder (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
Ivanovic’s team, injured, but all but dead, had to prepare a few tracktracks with meeting safety in order to get air again and in one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, made sure that the ad table was displayed again in a calming distance from (54-67), which the host could adorn at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alaves were bluffed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) had already announced that they would not allow anyone to take back the victory they had honestly earned in the first three-line minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson did not resign the best of their team and tried to give their team back through three points from the line (70-77).
Despite this, and although splitter was placed out of place due to fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis still picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being given the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in Group B of the Euroliga to him, and that was marked in a game marked by the collapses on the part of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the indoor game, which made the Greeks easier to win.
The team from Málaga had no fear of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship or of the opposing team, which may be one of Europe’s strongest and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their first-quarter game, they were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blended the host with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, even though the local team with an indoor play between Bourousis, Vujcic and short-sanitis managed to show the ad table in the 13th minute 22-20 to their favors, the minute in which it would have almost come to battle between the two American Beverley and Williams due to an action, and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to become warm at last and its superiority on both half-games, while the expulsion of England's Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three errors caused by Carlos Jiménez left behind clear traces of Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and Lithuanian forerunner Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A pick-up hunt was impossible
The third game quarter was marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, who, despite its 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to compensate for the difference in the game played in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn led to the leadership within the group.
Unicaja tried to get over the many failures and the elimination of the shot Robert Archibald injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages to the Unicaja, in the 31st minute thanks to the leadership and triples of Cook and the use of Lewis, some hope for 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, since the Olympics, once attacked and his superiority with centimetres within the basket area, was not to be brake.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute to raise the basket difference to 81-62, and Unicaja had to give up and take the lead in Olympiacos.
How much should you earn on Facebook due to your profile?
The users of Facebook can now learn their salary from the new Trovit application, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, that they should earn due to their profile.
The tool — how much you should earn — calculates users’ salaries based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. A form is available to users on Facebook, in which they can enter their profession, professional experience, age and city in which they work.
Even after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found out that the Spanish worker on average felt “badly paid,” explains the product manager, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Groβbritannia and France.
A British programmer will receive an annual gross of €45,226 and a French €31,059, as opposed to the €24,000 that a Spanish earns.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net content of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is the net of a waiter with an annual net of 11,592 euros; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and the work of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought after places on the Internet in the last three months are one driver, half-days and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date for leaving
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay in her embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President removed from office must leave diplomatic representation at the latest on 27 January 2010 if his mandate officially expires
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate to the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV station TV Globo that \"Mel\" was going to have to leave the message he had found since September 21st.
\"He is aware that he will have to leave on 27 January, as his mandate will expire that day and he will have to look for a new accommodation.\"
The broadcaster also quoted the ex-president who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the confirmed date: “My point of view is to go as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil,” Zelaya said on the phone.
Following the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as a winner), Zelaya assured that he will remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed at Zelayas’ refusal to acknowledge the status of an asylum-seeking politician who wanted to impose on him the de facto government under Roberto Micheletti's presidency.
Thank you so much!
After the most enticing days since past spring, where the inflation of the assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is in no way surprising, as this is its natural state, in an environment where the brokers make decisions about a natural insecure future.
The measure used to stabilize the markets was to settle the debts with the direct purchase of assets and to indirectly leave the liquidity free at interest rates that move around zero so that the banks buy assets for accounting.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets of assets are as good as finished and, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, begin to scatter some sand into the gearbox, as the BCE näc has already done with its annual increase the next week.
That is why investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox mawinds and we are just witnessing a conversion in reducing the risk premium.
The refugees of the stock exchange and differences with the company boni rise again, even though they are far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states saw themselves forced to state the private risks and the state debt rose again.
It is now set back on quality and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the eurozone and Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability until now, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision down with regard to Spain's rating.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of moral risk, who have again tried to raise awareness among the world economic policy responsible for what they had caused, as they had avoided the devastating effects to which the restriction of loans resulted in the loss of jobs when they were supposed to have taken a new day of gratitude action.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai suggests a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates, and development in Greece was also predicted earlier.
A government that avoids state debt, elections and a new government that draws the same strand.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sórrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin saves Hungary from non-performance of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year, thus allowing a euro-member country to stop fulfilling its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account the necessity of auβer-common maβams in order to maintain the stability of the state funds.
Yes, we are expected to face an episode of normalization of the risk premium, after some evictions on too high an amount, that would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in state debt increase at the same speed as the European corporate boni.
However, if European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish would continue to increase, this would be a particular Spanish risk.
While the so-called preferred indicators force a large part of the market research institutions to prefer their scenarios for recreation and to correct their 2011 scenario upward, the OCDE and the European Commission, which again come with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, promises all of this despite warnings not a long life.
Again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment it is said to be “cautious when driving”.
Connected Branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, appeared as the first yesterday before the House Subcommittee, where the strategy on energy supply in Spain will be debated over the next two decades.
After his appearance, on which the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca followed, Galán gave the press some points about what he had been subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to Iberdrola’s chairman, Spain must invest 50 billion euros and further 60 billion from that date until 2030, with the provision that the current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment required would not amount to 60 billion, but to up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that one should no longer invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international allies.
As of 2020, the question will change and the performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energy.
In this case, it is expected that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the provision of natural means by other “support energies”
Galán, who believes that the draft of law for a sustainable economy just adopted by the government is on a line with what his company has requested, would in no way say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, \"in the long term, one clearly sets out this direction, despite some \"single\" measures, as she called Iberdrola's chairman.
If it were to be, Galán thinks that you should already make the decisions on investment, even if they are in the long run, as it will take some time and a stable payment framework will have to be created to attack them.
Ferrovial gets the “handeling” from Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for land services, Switzerland’s Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish Flu company Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been announced numbers, has been made up to five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol for cooperation for the creation of an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures yesterday.
The alliance plans investments from 20 million to 2012, 50 percent of which will be from Ferrovial.
One of the main tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona competes with High depth and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona fights for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction it is, is a tunnel that will cost $1.7 billion (about EUR 1.047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German high depths are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for aciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The city administration wants to have completed construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration of a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) has decided to advance the project according to a business plan established by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and touring management.
In expectation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amounted to $1.7 billion in Australia (€1.047 billion), with three consorties, mainly from European construction companies, competing with each other during the last phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia’s largest construction companies, while the second is based in Italy, one of the best specialists for deep construction.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield responsible for infrastructure and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the closer choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), which also owns native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
However, the Australian market for infrastructures promises tremendous construction and privateisations, but it has a hurdle to overcome, since only by buying a local construction company can you get access.
A strategy that the companies mentioned have followed high depth or blfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has only gained access to this market by its share of 30% in high depth, the owner of the mentioned Leighton.
Millions of active people
Acciona places great importance on this geographical area for the industry, in which it is already very well known as energy supplier and in the desalination industry because of its activities.
Among other activities, it already has its large-scale windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies that have been assigned to build and manage Adelaide’s desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergys to gain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The underground Mautstrecke, which is funded by the City of Brisbane’s Infrastructure Office and the Northern Link (North Tobringer), has the purpose of connecting the western highway in Toowong with the surrounding road in Kelvin Grove (see map) at a length of 5 kilometers by tunnel, which is the largest mawing for the storage of roads on Brisbane’s Straits.
The schedule issued by the city administration is scheduled for the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toy route is already open to traffic in the last few months of 2014, it is expected that construction will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two tracks in each direction, an electronic mouse system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland is involved in funding with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
For high depth Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia awarded high depth, which signed a contract with the government 154 million years ago, again and again considerable orders.
The ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with glass fiber cable by means of its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create quick internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower’s construction project with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane, which has not yet started and has received 129 million for this purpose.
Also in the United Kingdom, Manchester, Laing O'Rourke competes for the construction and administration of two schools to 25 years.
The initial investments amount to 75 million euros.
FCC receives a contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC has managed to build a tunnel over 2.1 kilometers in length for a highway in Slovenia over the sum of €64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the addition for construction work to extend the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
This way Alpine strengthens his experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the construction work is planned for early 2010 and its execution will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has attributed advertising and marketing services to Sra. Rushmore for the next two years over a sum of about three million euros annually, the railway company said.
This contract also provides the opportunity for two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that have presented themselves to this competition, written by Renfe, from which 4 came into the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be tasked with the design and manufacture of the campaigns.
Punishment over 63 million for France Télécom for the outbreak of competition.
France Télécom has imposed a penalty over €63 million on anti-combatant behaviours in the Caribbean territories belonging to the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has limited the competition on fixed network and mobile phone by signing exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programs for consumers at the edge of the regulation.
Together with this sanctions, the former French monopoly and still state companies have collected more than €560 million in penalties since 1994 due to the disability of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, since the authority waiting for the competition is of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar offenses in the past and has therefore been reinstated again.
Application Trade
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading page on the Internet to increase the revenue from business that does not come from the telephone connection.
Basically, this acquisition website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
We have to wait until 2010 until this site is also available in other countries, such as Spain.
The match at the Champions League has brought in Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
The Champions League has developed into a source of revenue for the Fuβball Club since its creation in 1992.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, bringing them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The UEFA Champions League not only brings glory to itself, it is also one of the main sources of revenue from the major clubs.
According to the UEFA, up to €5.362.5 million has been distributed to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since its founding in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The Weiβe Club is located in third place Europe, which has earned the most money by its participation and the only one next to the AC Milan that won the trophy three times.
The final winner of the former European Cup in 1992, the official Catalan champion and the last winner of the former European Cup, is placed in fifth place.
The list will lead Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams who also took the most money through their participation in the past Champoins League.
And that, even though they have lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third of the countries that could take money through the Champions, although it has more titles than everyone else (five, unlike four bis Italy, three at England and two at Germany).
Distribute
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money distribution process that the UEFA is applying.
In this financial year, the organization, whose vice president Michel Platini has in it, accounts for 1,090 million revenue by the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Auβerdem got those who fought to participate, 3.8 million through their bloated presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (80,000 Euros) and for an undisputed (400,000 per team). The clubs that have come to the eighth final receive three million each; the four who have come to the quarter-finals, 3.3 million.
The last four are four million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second, which receives 5.2 million.
In this way, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and at most 31.2 million in fixed revenue.
Barça again earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Super Cup in August.
However, there are still variable payments for which 337.8 million are provided.
This money is given proportionally to the value of each single television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
The master of last year receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play during this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The group Nueva Rumasa has recently launched details about the purchase of shares that it wants to acquire a border between 25 and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In the concrete, Nueva Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share, which is paid out for 10 years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the sos shares ended with €1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jeréz gives shareholders a period of 15 days to communicate their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the authority.
Upon completion, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to structure his management.
When trying to stay at the edge of possible purchase offers and the court-martials of his ex-manager, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal book review.
A decision with which she becomes the first woman to have a high job with the food company.
It is a newly created post that directly supports the chairman of the group.
This is all but free from polemics, because the company is engaged in a judicial battle because of the suspicion of reversing more than 230 million of Sos to other societies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will continue to shift capital over the next few months.
In view of Salazar's credit, ex-advisor Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared yesterday before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the shift of 212 million without knowing their determination.
CNMV approves the public exclusion of Paternina submitted by the Investment Company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion for Federico Paternina, submitted by the Investment Company Mer on 9 October.
The supervisory authority declared that it approved this request after it has been proven that the conditions are in line with the laws of law and can therefore be considered \"adequately\" to the content of the declaration, following the amendments of the last 2 December.
CNMV has also announced that this offer aims to acquire 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of EUR 7.65 per share, which is 8.95% of the company's capital, which is composed of €6,142,786 in shares approved by Madrid and Bilbao.
Auβerdem has yet been reported that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the conclusion of the tenders and whose price of Federico Paternina has been set in accordance with the laws of law.
New programmes for assessment of vehicles
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the KFZ workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged into the workshops, where an auditor must assess the damage and costs of repair.
No single accident is the same and the calculation of the costs for the parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer science tools, it is a question of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of the auditors use these types of systems.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repair collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process them afterwards and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all reviews are made with their products.
The two other companies competing with the tool market for review and processing of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that the manufacturers provide is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audex's sales manager, 63 manufacturers and importers work together, each of which provides the information in a different format.
The amount of data to be processed will become bigger and larger until the point that over the last five years even more versions, variants and motorizations have come to market than over the entire fifteen years.
As soon as a new car comes to the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a difficult task, because every single one of the but thousand vehicle parts must be catagolyzed and its price entered.
In addition, a “intelligent” background image is created by each model on which to “click” different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, work can be completed in a week if the procedure progresses quickly.
When it comes to a less common car, it may take up to three or four months for Audex to have full information at 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle park driving on the street, it is more than 99%.
For the purpose of performing documentation work and producing databases worldwide, Audex has eight (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) distributed centers and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually experts for mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audex invests €90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Each month, they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every second day.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in a variety of ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, however, depending on the country there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for the calculation of the traffic value of a car.
The only company that learns about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
With the transparency of the products that Audatex offers, you can easily provide an overview of the type of support that they provide to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the Star of the AudaPlus products being a standard solution to combat accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
Auβer the cost of the parts, it contains the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each review.
It is most expensive for customers who rarely use it a maximum of ten times a month, i.e. 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, each insurance company, which makes thousands of reviews, negotiates the price with Audex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can completely identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly belt using the driving frame number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the commercial market on the Internet that can be offered for vehicles that have been declared to be total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or for obtaining information about the deviations by brand and model.
For example, you can examine how many models of a particular car brand had to go into the workshop due to panels or how many of them were engaged in a serious accident in a given period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing these kinds of computer tools.
Among other things, it distributes Gt Estimate, which is also intended for auditors and delivers digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions to assess damage, damage or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT leader for reviews is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 auditors and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% over the last three years, and in 2008 sales amounted to €10.8 million.
In the beginning of last year, they also began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audex, on the other hand, was founded in 1966 in Germany and established in 1979 in Spain.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is done in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.

Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Increase of accidents cars on the Internet
In the past October, the group Solera Autoonline bought a record on the internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of €59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value increases, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service applies exclusively to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, auditors, car rental companies, workshops, shopping malls and car dealers who have to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them alone in Germany.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 auditors.
Every day, 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose vehicle number has been registered may no longer drive on the road lines, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, the cars with historical value may be re-authorized even if they have been unregistered by difficult authorities.
Cost advance of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audex ensures that the user receives a cost advance in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, searching the spare part, creating and creating a cost advance.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince the older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database comprises 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 land cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by means of the driving frame number, a graphic of the respective model appears and after that the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables, such as the price for work hours, uptimes or discounts, and after that he can print the cost advance and pass it on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for assessment such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workplace-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of use for this tool is 350 euros a year, a amount that the customer can pay without further charge.
At present, the company Audex is working to offer these images in three-dimensional format as well.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for for a long time, because they can choose a door with it, for example, and then turn the image completely around to look at the inside.
