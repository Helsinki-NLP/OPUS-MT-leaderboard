Members of Wallish Assembly worry they’re going to look ‘like sweets’
There is consternation among some meeting members about the proposal that they should change titles from AM's to MWP'e (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Wallian Parliament.
Members from across the police spectrum are afraid that it can attract a spotter.
One member of the Workers' Party says his group is concerned because — this with Twp and Pwp rift —
For readers outside Wallis: In Wallies, twp means stupid and pwp means discharge.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru party says the group as a whole is — not happy — and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Wallian Conservative Party says his group is — receiveable — about the name change, but noted that it is a short speech jump from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of fool or fool.
In this context, the Welsh letter w like the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter is pronounced to you.
The Assembly Commission, which currently drafts legislation to implement the name changes, said: “The final decision on any descriptions of what Assembly members are called will of course be a matter for the members themselves -
The Wallis 2017 Government Act gave the Wallish Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received extensive support to call the meeting a Wallian Parliament.
In terms of the AMs' title, the Commission elected Welsh Parliament Members of WMPs, but the MWP option received the most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM's seem to be presenting alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus can be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who must present a bill on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the meeting's way of working, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM's will get the last word in the question about what they should be called when discussing the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country's name
Selectors will vote on Sunday whether their country’s name should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was arranged in an attempt to wipe out a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has for a long time been demanding that the name of its neighbor in the north represent a claim in its territory and have repeatedly captivated against its applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the popular vote on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's become quiet because churches in Harlem struggle
“Historically speaking, the old people with whom I spoke said there was a bar and a church at every corner,” said Adams.
“No one of the two is there anymore,
He says that the disappearance of crows is understandable.
“People are socializing in other ways,” he said.
“Croats are no longer neighborhoods’ family rooms where people go regularly.”
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders expect — and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started —
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining resorts.
“The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and therefore will bring the day these churches completely close even closer, because most of the people who enter these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation withdrew in the 1930s.
A black church that worshiped nearby took over the building’s title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
David Johnson, Father Johnson’s son and successor to St. Martin’s, proudly called the carillon —the poor people’s bells.
The expert who played the carilion in Julie called it something else: a cultural treasure — and — an irreplaceable historical instrument —
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been played at St. Martin's in the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the leakers of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The Church Council, the Congregation’s governing body, consisting of leaks, wrote in July to the bishop with concerns that the diocese — going to try to transfer the costs — to the Church Council, although the Church Council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some church members complain about a lack of transparency from the diocese's side.
Shark injured 13-year-old on a creek dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived for a crow on the first day of the creek season in California, officials say.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he spent half an hour diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help and then rowing closer with a group to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was just the excitement of a first crow, but then he realized — that he called, “I’m bitten!
I'm bitten!\"
His entire key leg was torn open, - saw Hammel when he came out of the boy.
“I called for everyone to come out of the water, ‘There is a shark in the water!’” he added.
The son was taken to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as criticism.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Livercapt. Larry Giles said at a media news session that a shark was noticed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his bully.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swamis in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams are fighting department store-type beauty walks that have been manned by specialist assistants.
As part of a large expansion in the UK’s £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and homeware decline, the larger beauty walks will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if it is a success next year will be taken to more stores.
The investment in beauty takes place while supermarkets look for ways to fill racks once used for TVs, microwaves and homeware.
Sainsbury’s says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will include trade names such as Revlon, Essie, Twezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Consistent series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more place with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also launches its Boutique gripping series again so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something on which younger buyers are demanding.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in South London and a second that will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller quantities of food purchased daily at local convenience stores means that supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive officer of Sainsbury’s, said that the stores will look more like department stores when the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food products against Aldi and Lidl discount stores.
Sainsbury’s placed Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of habitat sales points since it bought both of these chains two years back, which, according to their grocery products sales, strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy divisions failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument on how to divide profits from the pharmacies within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s three years ago sold his 281 store pharmacy business for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s trade director, said: “We transformed the appearance and sense of our beauty habits to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special-trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice.
Our range of trade names is designed to meet every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a ranged beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping -
Peter Jones 'worship' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones ran away 'worshiping' after TV provider Holly Willoughby pulled her out of a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their home dress-and-beside trade name, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
This morning's provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand business at the last moment - focusing on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones — alarmingly — was when TV’s golden girl was announced Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new opportunities — worth up to £1.5 million — mean that she can no longer spend enough time on their home clothes and accessories trade name, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trade name and would have doubled Willoughby’s estimated £11 million fortune according to dedicated dedication.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones climbed a jet and exchanged Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says: “Truly, Holly’s greatest priority was at far away.
It would be her long-term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw from her was absolutely stupid for all of the people involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that is right to be sold -
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning offerer, one of Britain’s stars that brings in the most money, can chase the firm millions out of the bag due to the icy investment in products stretching from pillows and candles to clergy and home clothes, and the possibility that its introduction may encounter even more delays.
This can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent share in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, “We’ll not comment on his business matters.
Hard words “and then we fall in love”
He mocked at the criticism he was going to get from the news media because he made a comment that some would consider “unpresidential” and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his \"newsreader\" voice.
“I didn’t give up —
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament burned down.
North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said on Saturday, more than three months after the June leadership meeting in Singapore, to leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a — consistent response — from the U.S. to North Korea’s early disarming activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues sanctions aimed at holding the pressure.
Trump has taken a much more optimistic impact in his conference speech.
“Our progress is excellent with North Korea,” he said.
“We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have this wonderful relationship...
He says his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results - it has ended rocket tests, helped free hostages, and caused the rest of American soldiers to be brought back home.
And he defended his unusual approach to describing relationships with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of ten thousand people out there trying to get into “this stuffed arena, we’d have nearly 200 people just standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tygolf and earthquake in Indonesia destroys island, kills hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations have been said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has been displaced, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalizing international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international help, which makes it a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not sure if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials assess the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the assistance effort.
Given the earth-shaking that Indonesia is constantly enduring, the land is unfortunately poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, it is not a common sight to other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning sirens in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though a warning was of force.
It is at best challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Yoko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia’s sophisticated infrastructure a core point of his election campaign and has published controversial money on roads and railways.
However, Mr. Joko’s administration is threatened by funding deficits as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Yoko is also facing the pressure of slowing sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands of displaced like Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with cape, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri indicated to Sturridge when he was 30 years away from the Chelsea goal and his team was 1-0 behind.
He typed the ball to the left before kicking far to the goal.
The attempt has sailed high over the frame as it has to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball drummed over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was just trying to get into that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time for myself as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Edge coming and typed once and didn’t think too much about it and just kicked —
Chelsea was 1-0 at half time before the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goal-header played back to Mateo Kovacic in that playroom with a back-up head before heading toward the midfield and sinking into the Liverpool assists.
Kovacic quickly received and indicated in the midfield.
With a beautiful forward kick, he then led Hazard into the frame.
Hazard passed the defense and ended with a left-foot kick over Liverpool’s Alison Becker in the far-right goal net.
Liverpool celebrates Wednesday at 3 pm the fight against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea comes Thursday to stand in London in the UEFA Europa League in front of Videoton.
Death toll increases to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami climbed to 832, the country’s disaster agency said early Sunday.
It has been reported that many people were trapped under the rubble of buildings that caused the earthquake, which struck a total of 7.5 on Friday, and caused firefighters of up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was sown with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after woman is murdered
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found in Grayson Mews in John Street at 7.55 am, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the territory who had heard or seen anything, to get ahead.
Spire Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: ‘The investigation is at an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured anything on Dashcam film material, to contact us as they can have information that could be essential to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found within a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman at the scene came up to ask questions about where she was found tonight.
Investigations continue as police said they were in the process of informing the victim’s next-door residents.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment but was advised by police that no one in or out of the building is allowed.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
People are told that it will take hours before they get back in.
It was heard that a police officer told one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She said again and again, ‘It’s so bad.’
At 2 pm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officials are allowed inside the cordon to monitor the block apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to switch @MerPolCC to DM, 101 or to link Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell becomes the latest memorial hit with ‘rewriting history' controversy
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as \"satisfaction\" and - an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statutes that the designs of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be a target.
The image-storming of the English civil wars was yet to be carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's maniac portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still memorable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is established is that the conflict of the mid-17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as a Protector is also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
Murder pork Disturbing Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by his van, —Yuan — was found dead with a torn butchery covered with blood near a cage at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he traveled with his cousin of the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door to a nearby pighog open.
He said there was a great male pig in the cage with blood in his mouth.
A forensic investigation, according to the report, confirmed that the 550-pound pig bitten the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeding and tearing,” said the cousin, who was mentioned on her, “Wu,” quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera film material showed how Yuan entered the market Thursday at 4.40 vm to feed its pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening New that the pig was locked to prevent someone else from attacking, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities allegedly negotiate compensation for his death.
Although weird, cases of pigs that attack people have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650 pound pig caught a Welsh farmer against its tractor until his wife terrorized the animal.
After a farm of Oregon was feared by its pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba for CBS News said that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as “faster.”
“They’re not playful.
They're picky, very curious... they're not going to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect, he said.
Res from Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to southwestern U.S.A.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 m.p.a., a Category 1 hurricane, from 5 pm east, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move northward.
Meanwhile, a truce across the Pacific Ocean begins to take shape and move eastward to the western coast of the US. As Rosa Monday approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will start to drive heavy tropical humidity northward to the southwestern U.S..
Rosa will bring rain from up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity will bring about widespread heavy rainfall in the south-west over the next few days.
Locally, from 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, floods of waste, and possibly falls of land in the wilderness.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-place rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially over the largest parts of Arizona.
Kits floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the spread nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to risk it on foot in the wilderness with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep-rooted deserts to touch rivers and thunderstorms will bring severe local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring a little local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rainfall total levels of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth rideways.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rainhouses will leave Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rain late Monday and Tuesday will be more widely distributed.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperatures can be seen across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, tamming summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
It is expected that large parts of the central and eastern U.S. will start warm October, with widespread 80s from the Southern Layer to parts of the North East.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of above average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks on Thursday for the attacking testimony of High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political death point continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday’s on-the-nipper turn: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was intoxicating her and was trying to pull her clothes out at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a heartfelt testimony, said he is 100 percent sure it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the following Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people looking in offices.
To put it in perspective, an audience is as big as one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day’s long trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was still high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested Friday morning on CNN and CBS, where protesters shouted at him when he tried to take a lift to a judicial committee.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes while CNN was vividly portraying how he was being bad.
“I’m right here for you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he told the country the truth?
It was said to him, “You have power while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and went before the elevator door, saying he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered living hours later when the Judicial Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would do it only with the understanding that the FBI would look at the allegations against the candidate for the next week, as the Democrat minority had requested.
Flake is partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK EM May accused critics of ‘political game’ about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “political play” with Britain’s future and undermine national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should advance each other’s tariffs —all-timely ridiculous — was a challenge.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspected Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the riot.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, reports CBS-affiliated WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted that he had killed Wayde.
His bailout was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
East Baton Rouge Parish’s judicial body issued a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head at the neck.
The Department praises the Louisiana State Police’s refugee task force, the state police’s crime laboratory, Southern University police, and district citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletics Director Joe Alleva thanks the area law application for his —year and pursuit of justice —
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six forecaster grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
Its average previous season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was in —plate-beat — and — in shock — about Wayde’s death.
“That’s what you worry about,” Wayde said.
Vulcan spewing as in Mexico City
As it sprang from the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital reached.
The National Center for Ram Prevention warned Mexicans Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater picked up and recorded 183 releases of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center has been monitoring multiple draughts and shakes.
Images on social media have shown how thin gas engine windscreens near Mexico City cover such as Xochimilco.
Geofisics has marked an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since an earthquake with an extent of 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as “Don Goyo,” has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalonian separatists before commemoration of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined in protests to commemorate the first commemoration of Catalonia’s polarizing vote for closure.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by illustrious police threw them with eggs and powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets usually of tourist weaving.
A Stoeery also broke out later in the day, and the police had to use their knots to keep the fighting in a rope.
Over several hours, pro-independence groups on one tone — No forget, no forgiveness — sang in confrontation with the Unionists’ cry of “Lank Life Spain”
Forty-one people received treatment for minor injuries committed in the processions, the local press reported.
The tension continues to run high in the independent region a year after the referendum of 1 October by Madrid was considered illegal but celebrated by separatist-Catalans.
Selectors overwhelmingly voted to become independent, but the participation was low, with those against deliberation that largely boiced the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent the voter from continuing at the polling sites across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups campaigned on Friday overnight to prevent a protest in support of the national police.
The protest continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he is no longer hopeful for the prospect that Catalonia will gain independence.
Last year, we went through one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry of joy because they could vote but now we are stuck, he said.
Despite a vital dog nail scrap victory in regional elections last December, Catalonian pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most famous leaders either in self-trained exile or in detention in prejudice for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more stressed,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalonian leaders in preliminary hearing arrests since late last year, announced that he will be in European Parliament elections next year.
“Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to eliminate the decline in democratic values and the oppression we saw from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Mans arrested after car at home
Three men, 33, 34, and 39 years old, were arrested after a car repeatedly caught up at a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded on Thursday at about 19:30 BST in Ballynagard's Singel.
Spire Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot at the car at a stage.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingston guaranteed victory
Advanced Livigston surprised Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s goal was evidence of the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved to second with Hibernian.
Gerrard’s team has stayed in the Premiership without a break and comes to face the leaders of Heart next week, which is their eight points ahead.
Rangers first hosted Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston expands their unsurpassed run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still not taste a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston plays chances against bot visitors
Holt’s team had to go ahead long before they recorded a goal, with their round-brushedness that Rangers had encountered all sorts of problems on the neck.
SR broke through, but carried on in front of the goal box, when AL could only play wide after he got closer and met CH's headhold across the goal box.
The hosts were pleased to have Rangers play before them, knowing that they could get the visitors with death-game moments.
And so came the decisive goal.
Rangers stood off a freelance and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson, who together gave Menga the chance to kick and sign a goal from the center of the frame.
By that time, Rangers had ruled but could not force the home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unscathed.
That pattern was continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a resurgence of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was fired by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow typed wide to escape Livingston’s open game.
Crossings repeatedly reached Livingston’s frame and repeatedly turned away, while two penalties — following Halkett’s challenge of substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball — were dismissed.
\"Fenomenal\" of Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and results for Livingston.
Up to the last man was excellent; they still surpassed expectations on this upward track.
Their game style and team have been nearly unchanged since their return to first rank, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his manipulative defense arrangement while Menga kept mostly on their toes for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers, however, have gained inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once were they able to push through the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, which they find in middle division.
Erdogan gets mixed receptions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) there were smiles and blue air when leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They have had a fallout on issues that include human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s entry to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters — many of them Kurdians — also made their voices thick and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The fighting protests reflect the division of a visitor greeted by some German Turks as a hero and received by others as an autocrat.
Deptford path accident: Biker dies in collision with motor
A cyclist died in a collision in London involving a car.
The collision took place about 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-trap in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident took place.
The Metropolitan Police said officials are working to identify the man and inform his neighbors.
Path closures and bus redirects are in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Keepers injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high security man's prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out on Sunday at 09:30 BST and was still under way at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist —Tornado retainers — has been called on to handle the riot, which includes eight prisoners and is confined to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel were deployed to pay attention to a continued incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those who are responsible will be referred to the police and will be able to stay behind bars longer.
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the chief of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, unscrupulous officials were called on to pay attention to serious disorder during which staff with billiards were attacked.
Hurricane Rosa Drieg Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kits Floods (Drought Areas Trek Dalk Advantage)
It’s unusual for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but it’s exactly what can happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy moves across the southwestern desert and brings kit flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash floods for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa Tuesday is expected to take a direct route across Phoenix, and will be approaching with rain by Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The National Hurricane Center’s models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated quantities of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon border of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. Southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Come, will probably get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals from possible to 4 inches.
For those outside kit flood risk, Rosa’s rain will likely be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, this rainfall will likely be beneficial as the Southwest currently experiences drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, only about 40 percent of Arizona has experienced at least extreme drought, the second highest category, — report weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to the approach of land across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still against hurricane strong Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is getting cooler in the Pacific Ocean and therefore takes its power off.
So it is expected that he will reach the country in the afternoon or evening against tropical storms in Mexico.
Rainfall across parts of Mexico can be difficult and pose a significant flood risk.
Rainfall totals of from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible, - report weather.com.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the Arizona border in the early morning hours as a tropical depression and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
“The biggest danger expected of Rosa is very severe rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the U.S. Southwest,” said the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains can cause life-threatening flash floods and debris in the deserts and earthquakes in the mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton Attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage sons-in-law a 20-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with a stroke found in Somerset.
The injured teenage son was found on Saturday at around 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to hospital where he was still in a “stable” condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any mobile-image material of what has happened to come up with.
Trump says Kavanaugh has \"suffered under the community, the anger\" of the Democratic Party
A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the unmerciful and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party, Trump said at an assembly in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh — having suffered under the community, the anger — of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
On Thursday before Congress, Kavanaugh testified, enthusiastically and emotionally, to Christine Blasey Ford’s claim that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the trial of her claim.
The president said on Saturday that Americans saw that day —the brilliant and quality and courage — of Kavanaugh.
A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most competent legal spirits of our time, a lawyer with a pure record of public service, he said to the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination while talking about the importance of Republican rise in mid-term elections.
Five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not standing, but I'm standing, he said.
That's why I fight for these candidates everywhere...
Trump has argued that the Democrats are on a mission to “resist and hinder”
The first important procedural vote on the Senate floor about Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place not later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant said to CNN.
Hundreds of deaths due to Indonesian shooting, tsunami, with figures still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many were washed away when huge waves broke down on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said authorities Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu on the beach on Friday for a feast on the beach when firefighters broke high at sundown on the beach from up to six feet (18 feet) high, washed away many after their death, and destroyed everything in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-range earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia’s disaster relief agency BNBB during an information session in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come on its own, it pulled cars, steams, houses, it hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to free the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show numerous buildings and shops destroyed, bridges disrupted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the city was still rocking the coast.
A series of earthquakes are felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s agency for the evaluations and application of technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s giant shake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, sitting at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have worsened the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as “preciously” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels collapsed.
Bodys of some victims were found where they were trapped under the ruins of buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake-shaard.
Communication —is completely hindered with no information — of Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a disaster, but it can get worse,” they said.
The agency was widely criticized Saturday because they did not report that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur imaging material shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard screaming desperate warnings about the upcoming tsunami at the people down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water meets the beach and slanted buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately explain the image material.
The shooting and tsunami caused major power interruptions that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but evacuaters still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was reopened only for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo would go to visit dismantling centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-tsunami mortality rates rise above 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision’s staff arrived safely in Palu City where employees in dexteries sheltered in their office courtyard, they were on their way to scenes of destruction, Mr. Doeba said.
They told me that they had seen many houses that were destroyed, he said.
This is very bad.
Even while assistance groups are beginning to take on the terrible task of putting the disaster relief task into action, some people have complained that foreign assistants are being prevented from traveling to Palu with much experience.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies, and personnel from overseas can only begin after the area of the disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, “Good, it’s a national disaster,” we can open it up for international assistance, but it doesn’t yet have a status.
With the arrival of the second evening on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the tragic storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a river pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman for two days was trapped with her mother’s appearance next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachute weaving team directed two of the missing parachute weavers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Still those who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi including, were his students.
“As a senior in the parachute field, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media under the parachute weaving community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, were only answered with one grey rule, instead of two blue regulations.
“I think this means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26 750 while refilling OTM by Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26 750 from a Brink's worker on Friday who refilled an OTM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The car’s driver was cleaning up an OTM in an entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, according to while in press release, while the company’s member Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man — from behind the Brink's employee — ran running and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities must contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: “The being previously known as Kanye West -
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change occurs before his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new all Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that cancelled for “emotional reasons,” the program’s manufacturer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has already said in the past that the word for him has religious significance.
“I believe ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,’ West said earlier this year when he discussed his album title with radio presenter Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye — just reflecting our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of a number of well-known rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West employee, JAY-Z, has also already finished with or without a link sign and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use armed forces against civilians
Mexican newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised in the run-up to the country’s 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students never to use military power against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday to never use the army to petition the Mexican people.
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where up to 300 people were killed at a time when left-wing student movements were held throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities attract young people to gangs.
U.S. must double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the amount spent on research in this field, investors and AI practitioners Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even recently the U.S. has been an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced their plan last year: they aim to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Dubble the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding can double the chances that the next major AI performance will be achieved in the US, Lee said this week in an interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book —AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order — has been published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face Performance.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that hit the highest-rated American Othello player and later was a manager at Microsoft Research and President of Google’s China branch.
Lee has given recognition to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s robotics challenge and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government seats, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes away the academic leaders; it’s corporate,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have appointed influential people from other universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to help the U.S.'s AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be presented automatically to PhDs in AI,” he said.
China’s State Council issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint centre for artificial intelligence that aims to involve partners from the industry and the academic world and the White House announced the formation of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence came under fire for months.
Macedonians vote in election or country's name has to change
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday as to whether their name should be changed to — Republic of North Macedonia — acting that would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership bots for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, holds that their northern neighboring country’s name represents a claim in the area and has refused to admit to NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the rise will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote read: “Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece —
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it is a price that can be paid to allow Macedonia, one of the countries that have been created from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to pursue bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us, Olivera Georgijevska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough parliamentarys have said they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide it.
The name change will require two-thirds of the parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of unrest.
But the rise was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
“I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko bring out their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country’s name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small height and approached chairs in front of tents set up by those attending the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to connect with our heads up, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring a lot of necessary investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe the vast majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said a “yes” result will be “confirmation of our future.”
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute of Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum — less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote.
For the referendum to be successful, rise must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A setback in the referendum will be the first serious setback for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through entire Brighton defense for purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton defense in Manchester City’s 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalhead received an ant at the center of the series at the beginning of the series.
He chased between three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton goalk.
He then pushed a hand to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English forecaster used his first touch in the cage to send back the ball for Aguero, who used his right foot to beat the Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick up to the right of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with problems with his feet,” said City manager Pep Guardiola to journalists.
“We talked about playing for 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We are happy that he has made a goal at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League challenge.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
At that game, Aguero received the ball deep into the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touchdowns before leading Sterling to the farthest point.
The Sky Blues forecaster kicked the ball in the net just before he was over the backline.
Hoffenheim in Kampioeneliga Tuesday at 12:55 pm. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer Wants to Play Bearer Against Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playout, there is little reason to force another start.
But the ever-competent Scherzer wants to adopt the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still play-off implications for the Rockies, which has a one game lead above the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least achieved a promoter choice spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still want to capture their first division title.
“Although we play for nothing, at least we can play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will likely play at the highest level from any point of mine this year.
Why do I not want to participate in it?
The Nationals have yet to announce their start-up player for Sunday, but are reportedly favoured to have Scherzer thrown into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have started his 34th, had a throw-out session on Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-handed is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outtakes in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around his High Court choice Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican rise in mid-term elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It’s one of the big, big — I’m not standing, but I’m actually standing and that’s why I fight everywhere for these candidates, he said.
Trump continued, “One sees this ugly, ugly radical group of Democrats, one sees it happening now.
And they are now determined to take the power back by using any possible way, one sees the community, the genius.
They don’t care about who they are hurting, about whom they should walk to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and strength, we’re not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “resist and hinder”
“And one sees it over the past four days, he said, and has called the Democrats, bad and bad and generous and false.
He referred to the name of Senate’s judicial committee’s high-ranking Dianne Feinstein, who had received a hard bow from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leave the document out?
Uh, Uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting one - it was really weak body language - the weakest body language I've ever seen -
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is unbearable to those who say what they think
When Momentum’s activists voted in my local party to put me under censorship, it wasn’t just a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string of Workers' Party LPs for who's said we're not welcome - all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she stood up in a fearless way against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the moss of censorship criticized me for being different from Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically enough similar issues that Jeremy had with previous leaders differed.
The announcement to the Nottingham East Workers' Party meeting Friday said that — we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive —
For most of my eight years as the local Workers’ Party LP, it was exactly what Friday’s AR meetings were like.
Unfortunately, it is not today the tone of many meetings, and the promise of “friendly, more benevolent” politics has long been forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It became increasingly clear that different views were not being tolerated within the Workers’ Party and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the party’s leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views began expecting me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with — whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public — and it doesn’t really matter what I say — there is a tirade of shell language on social media that asks me not to be re-elected, reject politics from the core, and tell me that I shouldn’t be in the Workers’ Party.
And this is not just my experience.
I’m actually happier than my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shrinking away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every “motion of distrust” or change of selection rules, the party gets closer.
I had a lot of advice over the past two years that encouraged me to stay under the radar, not to be so outspoken and then I would be —oukei.
But I didn’t get the politics to do that.
Since joining the Workers’ Party 32 years ago, encouraged by the Thatcher government’s neglect that literally left my state high school failing, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it — whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused about my policy positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country sending off on a Brexit that will damage all households, businesses and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the Workers’ Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my voters, whether they are members of the Workers' Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political advantage will stop me from doing what I believe in all of you's best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unsurprising Ayr bo
Two late threes may have kicked the final result slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned to be victorious in this wonderfully entertaining Tennt's Premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the scorer, the only unsurpassed team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better odds, which the home team carried and coach Peter Murchie had all right to be satisfied.
“We have been tested so far in our matches and we are still invincible, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Honor Ayr, they took their chances better than we have —
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, targeted by Frazier Climo, made Ayr front, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot recorded an unsolicited three.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty head, just before he, just before rest time, intended a solo to make it rest time 17-5 for Ayr.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson’s three, targeted by Baggot, reduced the back to five points.
There was a long ceasefire for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott which was carried on a portable, and from the restart Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, targeted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unsolicited three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a very busy game.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he took off for Climo without the ball, and from the penalty line up, MacPherson pushed the ball to death behind the upcoming Ayr release.
Climo intended it, as well as almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's goalhead and sent off flank Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game star looks like he's going to tackle new career in restaurant industry
Still Game star seems to be moving to the hospitality industry after it has been discovered that it has been designated as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old played Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he wrote and played with former comediesman Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be the program’s last, and it seems that Kiernan is preparing for life to Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan be involved in Glasgow’s “floring restaurant industry.”
“The sea is ours: around Bolivia hopes court will reopen away to the Pacific Ocean
Matrose patrols a masonry covered fleet quarter in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are decorated with the slogan: “The sea is right ours.
It is a duty to get it back.
Throughout the border of Bolivia, the memory of the coastline they lost in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century to Chile is still fresh, as is the need to sail the Pacific again.
That hope is probably the highest it has been in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after 5 years of talks.
“Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and expects, of course, the outcome with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH statement on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president - who next year faces a controversial struggle for re-election - also has many that depend on Monday's ruling.
“We are close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor — and that little will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory, and has suggested that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH’s judgment comes only six months after the last visit shows that the case — not complicated — said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s case, it may have slowed down over the past four years.
“The issue of access to the sea was seized by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric raised any remaining Chilean kindness, she announced.
Bolivia and Chile will continue conversing at one point, but it will be very difficult to make bad conversations.
In 1962, the two countries replaced the last ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extremely fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia — an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile — and a chance to — to end 139 years of differences with recurring benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — is using the maritime issue as a political crumb.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific, he added.
“The judgment is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come unless their US can trust
North Korea’s Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country will never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri was at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a meeting in Singapore between the competing countries' leaders.
His remarks follow U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo despite being on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead point, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a dream picture that continued sanctions and U.S. capitulation will also bring the North on its knees to a statement ending the Korean War.
Washington is careful to agree to the statement without Pyongyang taking significant steps to disarm.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump wanted a second consultation.
But there is widespread scepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about doing away from an arsenal that the country views as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim Trump meeting.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest series of big main covers en route to the shops near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely turn off the sun, you don’t have to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of cleverly vast main covers at their SS19 collection on the running board that enchanted the style at Paris Modeweek.
Extremely impracticable hats passed through this summer Instagram and these designers paraded their past creations on the running board.
The flashing by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a furthest wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included wine lemons decorated with jewels, a sorcerer hat, and even a pine apple — but it is not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had finished lips and had more like Hannibal Lecter than skin coutures.
One creation looked like scuba equipment, with a snorkel and diving glasses included, while another looked like a melted creamy horizon.
And if you continue the great fashion, this is your happy day.
Style viewers predict that the huge hat may be on the way to the stores near you.
The oversized hat follows briefly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide edge seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpractical hat spread over social, sent another great creation across the walking board — a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the swimsuited model it wore.
The burned orange raffia bag, finished with raffia bracings and finished a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Modeweek.
Known stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags appearing in stores for next summer — since the designer made such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the application for oversized future.”
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have a zip performance of academic chastity, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which were only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that global languages continue to be a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.
It’s a powerful reminder that we can’t just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league table with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher degree A.
The data collected from SCIS’ 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French, and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will no doubt need in the future.
Languages now, as a subject choice, have the same view as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools’ curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Professions and Skills found in 2014 that of the reasons employees provide why they struggle to fill posts, 17 percent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically place a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-number percentage, 15 percent.
That’s why it’s so important to invest in today’s children’s language education.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach what is considered essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to achieve success regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still very important to the country’s future, and therefore it must be reflected in education.
True, modern languages should be considered to be “ international communication skills”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland’s young people.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make Sunday debut for San Diego Lakers
The wait is almost over for fans to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in San Diego in Sunday's preseason opening match against the Denver Nuggets.
But just how many minutes he will play, he has to be determined.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six games in the preseason program.
“I don’t need to be ready at this stage in my career,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia Assembly Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting a flag election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
It is Trump’s first of five scheduled moves in the next week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently being held for its choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump intends to build support for the upcoming inter-election because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when it is voted in November.
What time is Trump's move into West Virginia tonight and how does one look online after it?
Trump's move into Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 pm ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can look at Trump's confluences in West Virginia below via live stream.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's hearings for the appointing of the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense about charges of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote held for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main point of view of this surplus is to help the Republicans who stand before difficult elections in November.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign said that these five moves in the next week were aimed at visiting volunteers and supporters while Republicans were trying to protect and increase the majority they had in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Management over Congress is so critical of its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season,” said a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, who refused to mention his name, to Reuters.
Today’s draw, arranged for the Westbanco arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from —Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Western Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind according to the voting patterns.
“It’s not for Morrisey a good sign that the president should come to give him a boost to the poll,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have courage for the struggle to keep hope alive when entering Sunday's single game
After three one-sided sessions, the four-game team of Saturday afternoon was possibly just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of momentum is an overall distorted sports concept but one in which players believe wholeheartedly, and certainly in competitions like that.
Where would they say that the momentum is now?
“They went ahead with six points and now it’s four, so we carry it as a little momentum, I count,” Jordan Spieth said when he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points before and another twelve are played.
However, the Americans feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a bit of wind in their sails and that there is a lot to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the top to the backyard and led by his example.
Those scoring celebrations became louder as his round progressed and he sinked a critical set to match four completely equal while he and Thomas were behind after two rounds.
She set up the game at 15 for them, was greeted with a similar shout, the kind that says to a person that he believes the American team still has a chance.
“You really just have to get everything out and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all those players have to do.
18 puppies to print their stamp.
The only players to have more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s odd but charming couple got four out of four and can’t do anything wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who didn’t record one on the job issue on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided one on the job Saturday morning as well as during the back nine Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this exuberant crowd, confirms that they are the players to be knocked on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can clinch a potential European victory when the sun over Le Golf National sacks.
Select both simultaneously or at different puppies.
It is too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One held on track number and two doubles on the front nine led the Spaniard and the Swedish to a hole from which they could not even get.
On Sunday, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-balls and four-game teams are so exciting to keep track of because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can turn into an eye-wind.
Europe has always played better as a team so far and has taken on the last day meaningful the forward, but this four-game session has also shown that the U.S. team has had the courage for the fight that some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming with a 10-6 lead from Saturday’s four-ball and four-game matches.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score as far as Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who were trying to preserve the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that performed unevenly in the morning's four-balls, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. has more resistance in the four games and won two games, but they do not shrink the back.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 single game matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, who are named after a sensational weekend —Moliwood — are just the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup who scored four points after their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they played excellently together to win a pap Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliantness but now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and four-games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who restated during the morning's four-balls, returned to play with Henrik Stenson in the four-games to a 2&1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third on the world rankings.
Europe, however, on a pleasant day with a windy south-west of Paris, did not always get their sense.
Jordan Spieth who won a major tournament three times and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They recorded a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four-games after losing the first two puppies.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a back of four points when entering the single game, even though Furyk's team just had to play equal to keeping the trophy because they already hold it.
After being second best for two days, however, it doesn’t seem that they will get a counter attack on Sunday.
North Korea says they will “dissolve” one-sided with no confidence disarming
North Korea’s foreign minister said Saturday to the United Nations that continued sanctions would worsen the United States’ distrust and that the country would certainly not give up its nuclear weapons on one side without such characteristics.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body’s annual General Assembly that in recent years, North Korea —a significant measure of well-deserved well-will, such as to stop nuclear and missile testing, to break down the nuclear testing site and promise not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We see no corresponding response from the U.S.,” he said.
Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will certainly not disarm ourselves one-sided first.
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to removing nuclear weapons that would be rewarded by North Korea if it took progressive steps, his words seemed significant because it did not reject one-sided removal of nuclear weapons unconditionally as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Uen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim went on to work for the “destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea wants to have a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed requests for strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on the “destruction of nuclear weapons first” and exerts more pressure by strengthening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the “declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions worsen our unfaithfulness.
Ri said nothing about plans for a second peak meeting between Kim and Trump on which the U.S. leader turned attention to the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister called attention to three meetings during the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: “If the party were in this issue of nuclear weapons destruction South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead point —
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable for North Korea’s rockets to be directed at the U.S. land mass after “Mr. Evil President - Trump for Kim called a “firer” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea —all of it last year — praised Kim for taking steps to disarm, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a time frame for it, saying — it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months —
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pongyang for the steps they have taken.
But on Thursday, U.S. foreign minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: “Approving sanctions by the Security Council must be motivated and continued without stopping until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons —
Since 2006, the Security Council has unitedly strengthened sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to make funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs dry up.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pjongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit meeting.
Pompeo had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pjongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea accused him just hours later of putting —bad claims.
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon to break down a missile site and also hit a nuclear complex as the United States — consistent measures.
He said that Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he wants to see are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course over enough Russians
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all its undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to counter the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-driven ‘whole-day sessions’.
An academic has found that students at the world’s top university are often unaware when it comes to the basic principles of how to look at themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical Faculty and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after he delivered a talk about the effect of sleep removal on learning.
“At the end of it, one girl approached me and said, ‘Why do they tell me this now, in my senior year?’
She said that no one had told her how important sleep is - which surprised me,\" he said to The Telegraph.
The course, first presented this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrists at Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to enter the course after finding that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a few interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory, where students should click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by lack of sleep and the importance of a sleep time routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep removal can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think of their daily routine.
\"We know this won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know — just as you have the right to know what its health impact is to choose to smoke cigarettes,” added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of pride in studying “whole night” still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep removal is a growing problem.
To make sure you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's \"secret weapon\" should be to avoid stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, because sleep removal places the brain in a stark mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiaer who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after running one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to work for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students consider putting an alarm for when they are going to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effect of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadic rhythm and cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Target of Menga conquers Gerrard's men
Rangers experienced another sarcy of day-to-day heartache when Dolly Menga's goaltender Steven Gerrard's incompetent team had a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first as visitors since February's 4-1 days at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team had just been assigned to Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a driver so that his team were eight points behind Hearts, who ran loose in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga closed seven minutes before rest, and it didn’t seem like a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
While Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there can be further difficulty for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown off the side.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the final battle of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point of Hearts last week and he would have been in his noppies with the way his well-trained team had killed their opponents at each turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They had to record points after just two minutes when Menga's first defeat Scott Pittman passed on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder opened his big chance.
A deep freelance by Keaghan Jacobs subsequently found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only miss kicks at the rear goal.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he had to get a penalty goal at the quarter point when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get just two shots to the target during the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was reportedly plagued by Lassana Coulibally's headshot and a Mac goalhead of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of play, no one can deny that they earned it, even if it was just for their hard work.
Rangers once again did not handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard arrived at the break when he exchanged Coulibally for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but chased the impressive Kelly from his strip to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the type of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett palmming long ball after long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased their lead in the last stages, but McGregor stood up well to return Jacobs before Lithgow could reach far from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty head when he met with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from us — Sunday morning — Almanak: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, and OUR TEL VERDER ... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm —Hans — Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geigerteller has been a supporter of science, and it has also become a supporter in pop culture, as in the 1950s role film Bells of Coronado, in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: \"What on earth is this--
Rogers: “It’s a geigerteller that is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these overphones, you can even hear the effect of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: \"Good, it's cracking about--
Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues.
New cancer can teach the immune system to 'see' predators
New cancer can teach the immune system to “see” and die predators
Entoft teaches immune system to identify predators as part of treatment
Method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory
They can then “see” a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, learning the immune system to identify predators, saw her ovary cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can find a protein that is found in many cancers and called HER2 —see - and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzovsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine —
HER2 —powering the growth of several types of cancers, including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal cancer, has been explained by Prof Berzovsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and learning them — how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West began a pro-Trump mock speech after his actions on SNL, while wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn’t go well.
Kanye West was released in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an extended action in which he believed US President Donald Trump and said he would elect him in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town and during which he played a Make America Great-Pet, he went out against the Democrats and repeated Trump's support.
“I talk so often to a white man and they say, “How can you love Trump, he’s a racist?”
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from America long ago, he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on charges of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the image material of West’s slammed by comedian Chris Rock was loaded on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock for West tried to spot it.
West also complained to the audience that it was making it difficult for him behind the lift about what he was wearing on his head.
“They bullied me behind the rise.
They said, “Don’t go out with that hat.”
They bullied me!
And then they say I am in a low place, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say: “Do you want to see the low spot — and said that he would dress his superman coat, because it means you can’t tell me what I should do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try Love -
His comments attracted at least twice an issue to the audience and members of the SNL wheelchair seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication: “The whole studio has become deadly-
West was brought in as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rigger Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with an execution of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR BUILDING THE SCARES —
But chat programming gaswoman Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply — who he is and that it is absolutely wonderful —
“But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art) who I believe accepts and proclaim an ideology that puts my community at risk.
He is free.
We too, she added.
Before the show, on Twitter, the Rimkletzer announced that he had changed his name and said he is now — the being formerly known as Kanye West —
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Mede-rymkletzer, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, wide music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who used to be known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they should be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believed “something went wrong” and asked how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo-era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt “reasonably strong” about working on this issue.
“I personally feel quite strong about it at the moment — where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he said.
\"What have we learned men while growing up with regard to the problem we now see?\"
Kit believes that television is probably responsible for growing in toxic masculinity because of its extremely male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because something went wrong with our young men.”
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he will not participate in any of the Game of Thrones pre-season and prosecutions when the series comes to an end next summer, for he says he is \"ready with battlefields and horses.\"
As of November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard’s True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the best thing that came from Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
“I met my wife on this program, so that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the site of Leslie’s family estates in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, representing a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission by sex is a critical matter in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of these diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an attempt to make the case work.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has leaked GOP senators' data, condemns “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters ruled out Saturday against allegations that a member of her staff had placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislature's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations are driven by —ultrarights — experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and still disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The selected information is said to include home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel's hearing on the allegations of sexual misconduct against the appointed for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took place some time after the three Senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the postings relates to Waters’ office and announced the information of a member of Waters staff, the Hill reported.
“This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security has been put in jeopardy because of this deceptive and false claim - was not at all responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters’ statement soon attracted criticism online, including former White House press representative Ari Fleiber.
“This denial of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
It suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He doesn’t be challenging.
He does not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He needs to be calm and calm.
Fleischer apparently compared Waters’ reaction to the Democrat’s criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of seemingly being too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tries to light water in the interelection from the kisses, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
If that’s true, then he’s got to talk.
In her statement, Waters said that her office —the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these deceptive claims.
“We will make sure that the administrators are exposed, she continued, and that they will be legally liable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous for every member of my staff.
Johnny English Strikes Again review - flou Rowan Atkinson spying
It is now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new film with a British impact and it seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English action comedy spottery franchise - which started with Johnny English in 2003 and continued to struggle with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-kiss self-awareness on the subject of how obvious power we are the nation’s new export experience?
In any case, the unhelpful Johnny English with its outpourings and rubber face has its license to let everything go up for the second time — and its name is a clearer indication than anything else that it is a great comic creation for non-English-speaking film listeners.
He is, of course, the mocked secret agent who despite his bizarre pretense to sophisticated elegance a little from Clouseau, a piece of Mr Bean and a good shot from that old who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the opening of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of puzzles, who leaves chaos behind him, which Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest version of you.
I liked Johnny English coming in to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armoured coat and the screw sheets briefly capped against his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is shown but the humor feels quite faint and self-confident, especially when the “serious” movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now use self-confident comedy as a ingredient.
The humor feels that it is aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English’s adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silent jokes in the persona of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A Kuberkraker has infiltrated Britain’s supersecret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain’s agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on service — a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a prime minister who is an inflated and besieged character, who has already experienced an overall collapse of political unpopular: Emma Thomspson does her extreme best with this quasi-Teresa May character but there is little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers informed her that since every active spy is in danger, she should call someone out of his retirement.
And this means the struggling Johnny English itself, now employed as a teacher at some nice institution, but giving lessons from the record about how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English offers a School of Rock type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency call and is reunited with his former long-suffering companion Bough, once again, by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an allaapstic role in which too little of Vicki Pepperdine is expected.
Thus, the Batman and Robin are able to completely waste everything in Her Majesty’s secret service completely and get them off to Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful women fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister came under the dangerous enchanting of the charismatic technology billionaire who claimed to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, illustrated by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: mocked as waiters they fire a French restaurant, causing chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta’s luxury sail hunt; and English releases pure anarchy when he tries to use a headpiece for virtual reality to become familiar with the inside of Volta’s house.
For that last scene nothing is spared, but as cute and elaborate as it may be, the whole affair is quite much like children’s TV.
Reasonably mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t stop thinking: Can’t the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come to his right?
Labour denies that it plans a plan for British to work a four-day week but is paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause British to work a four-day week - but to be paid for five days.
The party claims that company-based savings caused by the artificial intelligence (KI) revolution must be transferred to workers by giving off their extra day.
This will allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend — but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say that it will ‘pass’ to the party’s economic agenda and plans to put the country in the favor of the workers.
To change after a four-day week, the Trades Union Congress endorses it as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior working party source said to The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits the party’s approach to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Workers' Party will not be the first one to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its campaign for the general election in 2017.
However, the ambition is not currently supported by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said, “A four-day working week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.”
Skadu Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to expand his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless directors” and “winners” at service companies.
The shadow minister’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not regain their entire investment as a worker government can make “deductives” on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on directors of companies and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in companies in the private sector to employees, who can get annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells — 60 Minutes — whether the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh can make them change their opinion
The FBI’s investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least a week and raised the question of whether the office’s findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, -60 Minutes -correspondent Scott Pelley for Republican sense. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could deepen anything that could make them change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his fellow South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that accusation came out, and said, “Have you done it?
He was firm, firm, unshakable.
Graham’s voice seems to be unchangeable.
“I formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will take a charge of dinamite,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know it: Brett denied it earnestly,” Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she calls could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing -
What is the World Civil War, and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will be the host to the World Civil Festival, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars that act and have an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Burger Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will stream to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy not only performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to create awareness for the occasion’s real purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Civil Liberation Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocate group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the occasion ( unless you are willing to pay for a GDP ticket), concerters had to carry out a series of tasks, or — actions — such as doing volunteer work, sending an email to a world leader, making a telephone call or any other meaningful way to create awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But just how successful were world citizens at 12 years of age who remained to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called “kliktivisime” - people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, World Burger says it has reported more than 19 million —actions — of its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says these actions helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that would potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements that resulted from its actions, at least $10 billion of which were already paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to helping — children reach their full potential — and promises to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
“With the support of the government of the UK, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social pollution of malnutrition a footnote in history,” said the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman in April 2018 during a London concert.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions taken to draw closer to the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the general questions on his website asking — what makes you think we can end extreme poverty —
Worldburger replied: “It will be a long and hard road — sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will be successful because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who perform at this year’s event in New York City, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use fleet for — blockage — to reverse exports of Russian energy — Minister of Home Affairs
If necessary, Washington can leave him on his fleet to stop Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a preoccupation to investigate new energy markets.
“I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just like in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe,” he said.
And, according to an official, there are ways and means to address them.
“The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy does not end up on the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees of an event offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit that considers themselves to be the — voice of the energy consumer — in the US.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to the handling of Russia and Iran and noted that it is practically the same.
“The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel,” he said while referring to Russia as a single talent, with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The statements come as Trump administration was on a mission to boost the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration’s officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “unpaste” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump Berlin Moscow’s “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fiery opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means to carry out pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with America’s Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S.'s view attracted opposition from Germany, which re-confirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading organisation for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged them to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will consider it — seriously — to stand as president in 2020, said Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she will consider it “severely” to stand as president after the mid-term elections.
At a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and it includes a woman at the highest sport,” she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will take it seriously to stand for President.
Warren expressed her opinion about President Donald Trump at the village meeting and said he — take the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m still worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was very prolific in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a second Friday, Warren said — of course we need an FBI investigation before our vote —
A recording released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not think she should stand in 2020.
Eighty-five percent of - likely - Massachusetts voters said the senator did not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Twenty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former Governor Deval Patrick must stand, with 38 percent having the idea that he should have potentially stood up and 48 against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed to possibly stand in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSV at Donald Trump Assembly
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
He was arrested Monday morning and charged with an incident of domestic violence
“What my own son is going through, what he has been going through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who feel the consequences of PTSV and the wound with which we soldiers return,” she said to an audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest — the elephant in the departure — and said of her son and other war veterans — they come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back, and wonder if there is the respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and air forces and every other member of the army have given to the country -
He was arrested and charged on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, in charge of domestic violence, assault of a woman, interference with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. support challenge of new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge of a new U.S. policy refusing asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the-court court order in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the dispute in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not made public.
She said her partner —and her violent gang members, — abused her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
The state prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applicants for U.S. Asia, as nations facing in-depth problems with gangs and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new U.S. Aviary Policy reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals ( Council of Immigrant Appeals) that allowed immigrants without the necessary documents fleeing from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy — decades’ state, federal and international laws — ignores
“Federal laws require that all asylum applications be determined on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a lawyer violates that policy,” said the friend-of-the-court court order.
Attorneys further argued in the lawsuit that the policies that refuse immigrants access, damage the U.S. economy, and say that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and will provide necessary labour -
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop allowing victims fleeing from domestic and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership to a specific social group or political opinion,” said Sessions in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to relieve all problems — even not all serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu while death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly new.
“It feels very exciting,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while comforting her feverous baby boy at a cleaning center in the destroyed city of Palu.
Each minute brings an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce -
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, searching for insurmountable possessions, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-range shake, were overwhelmed.
Of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's army hospital where patients are treated outside due to constant strong aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he tells of the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-deep hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was impressed in the wall's ruins, I think, - Haris told Associated Press and added that he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then silenced.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘depositing’ with ‘propaganda advertising’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily that praised the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily paid stake in the Des Moines Register — the state of Iowa newspaper with most sales — last Wednesday after accusing China of having filed in the U.S. Congress elections of November 6, a complaint that China denies.
Trump’s charge that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. elections has marked what U.S. officials have said to Reuters, a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war that has led to their rate rounds on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were aimed at striking exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former Governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion piece in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, — more often now the defamatory by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.
“By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seized America’s cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing, a person will find very limited disparaging voices and not see any real reflection of the various opinions the Chinese people had about China’s worrying economic trait, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that —one of China’s most prominent newspapers shrugged away from the offer of publishing his article —even though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienated women's voters before inter-elections with Kavanaugh debacle, warning analysts
While many top Republicans stood at High Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defended him in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see opposition during the upcoming inter-elections, especially from women.
The emotions about this are very high, and most Republicans are on record that they already indicate that they want to continue voting.
Those things can't be reversed, - said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s incentive for an FBI investigation would be enough to pacify bad voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday — they won’t forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters — November was on the way — drunk while they argued in the Senate’s entrance portal while the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high,” Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it was high; it’s true.
But it can be higher, especially among sway-woman voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president -
Even before Ford’s public testimony setting out the details of her indictment of sexual assault against the High Court nominee, investigators said a counter-reaction could follow if Republicans continue to confirm.
“This has become a serious barrier to the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee chairman, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not about the committee’s vote or the final vote and whether Kavanaugh is put on the court, it’s also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Prioritys USA, told the news channel.
But Americans seem somewhat divided over who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with slightly more choosing the latter’s side.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 say they are either determined or likely to believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely joked during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's urging, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford had been under oath last week before the Senate’s Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the High Court nominee revealed his relatives to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the worldwide web plans to start a new internet to say Google and Facebook the battle
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, runs a start business that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea is with Inrupt — world domination.
“We have to do this now,” he said.
It's a historical moment.
The application uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own — personal online data storage — or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, do list, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it relies entirely on the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it “personal authorization by data”
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff who are contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
As of this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications by using the utility available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to —Facebook and Google about the introduction of an overall change, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid -
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the Worldwide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while inrupt lead, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the Worldwide Web consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic about this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross Spiritual Celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored 100 years later in his home village.
Lt.kol honor Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sharp shooter four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was — brilliantly symbolic — that the stone was revealed for exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning performance.
According to the London Gazette, Lt.kol. From 29 September 1918, his battalion passed through the Canal de Saint-Quentin — due to many dense misses and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns —
He later rushed him to the line of fire and with the “greatest bravery” led the line forward before he stormed man-only a field gun and knocked out three of the department.
Lt.kol Vann was killed by a German sharp shooter on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.

He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a crane at the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he — felt honored to be able to play a role in the parade — adding that — the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given by a crowd of people —
MMA supporters stay awake all night watching Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night watching the follow-up pack Bellator 206, just to not be able to watch the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 battles, including six on the main program broadcast directly by night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Geward Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the fight, viewers in the UK were beaten to the ground when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressive after staying awake for the fight until the early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the transfer to the children's cartoon as — one or other sick joke —
“It is government regulation that the content was not suitable at 6 am and therefore they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the broadcast.
“Peppa the Pig,” he said.
Bellator’s president Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think that when I think of the broadcast, I think we can probably work out something,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won’t be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were many SMS that were sent back and forth and not all were friendly.
We tried to correct it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn’t, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five battles instead of six — as we normally do — and we have tried to offer more for our supporters and just went over our time.
This is an unfortunate situation...
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has a \"less worthy\" feeling about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority about his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t go to high school before he realized that — not everyone like me —
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he had expressed his feelings about gay rights to give others —hope.
He also said that to become a parent, he cared less lately about winning at the Olympics.
The regular provider of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, took off for a few months due to illness.
When he appeared in confusion on Laverne's first program, Daley said — less — than everyone else felt when he grew up, for — it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls —
He said: “To this day those feelings of feeling less than, and otherwise feel, the real things that gave me the strength and energy to achieve success —
He wanted to prove that he was, he said, so that no one would be disappointed when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-profile LGBT fighter and has used his appearance at this year’s State League Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he has expressed his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give others —hope.
The three-time world champion said that to fall in love with a man — US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — caught him onside —
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference has never been a matter.
When you went through so much at such a young age — he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced similar heights and low points.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says his “whole perspective” has changed.
“If you asked me last year, everything was about ‘I have to win a gold medal,’ he said.
“But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, “You’re not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and died that I finally admitted that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of for my life — to dive in front of my househouses at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first song songwriter — Proud by Heather Small — who also resonated with him in building up to the Olympic Games and still gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson did not drive and withdraw from Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to fix his form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record- 12th time in the two-year event, was pulled off the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball games and four-pieces.
Instead of being the center of action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will divide his day between being a race leader and working on the exerciseboard on his game in hopes of correcting what is going on.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the most straight driver, so the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National track where the long run always punishes the errands.
And as if the job on its own is not challenging enough, Mickelson comes on Sunday in his ninth match against the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with newman Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, which are four points behind, start the 12 single game games well, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely essential.
Füryk expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
“He fully understood his role today, gave me a knock on the back and put his arm around me and said he’d be right tomorrow,” he said.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Heroes Hall and he has contributed so much to this team in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think he would play two games.
I had more hope, but that’s how things worked out and that’s what we thought we should do.
He wants to be on the job, just like anyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record on Sunday for the player who played most Ryder Cup matches.
This can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never really agreed with the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson won 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven outs, although Fury said that his presence contributed to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcasmy, taken, likes to shave the crazy, and he’s a wonderful old man to have in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed having fun with him, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just a game.
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows great lead can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the last day's single game in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team under the leadership of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead, but won only nail scrap with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“One kept reminding himself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won nail scraps,” Bjorn said, in the photo, after watching the 2018 Class win 5-3 and last night at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it is not over.
You're going to be up tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it is to try to win the trophy, and that is where the focus remains.
I still say all the time, I focus on the 12 players who are in our team, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side - the best players in the world -
Rejoicing about how his players were at risk on the hard golf course, Bjorn adds: “I will never go ahead with it.
Tomorrow is a horse of another color.
Tomorrow it is the individual participation that comes in turn, and it is a horse of another color.
It’s wonderful to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re individually there, you’re tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to players, put the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also put the best out of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, his partner Jim Furyk would want his players to go better individually than they did as gamemates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furyk himself had already been converted on both sides of that great last-day, where he was part of the wish pan at Brookline before ending as a loser when Europe achieved the —miracle of Medina“.
“I remember every covert word of it,” he said in response when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 spoke up to his players on his way to that last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but a person would like to start well, as was seen at Brookline, as was seen at Medina.
When that momentum starts in one direction, it puts a lot of tension on those middle games.
We set up our team in this way and divided the men we felt, you know, for us tomorrow will bring something magical -
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the attack and comes in the main match against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the top half of the division.
“I chose this group of guys in this order because I think it covers it up to the end,” Bjorn said about his single-game career.
Germany's new warship is postponed again
The German army's latest frigate would have been employed in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The use of the “Rheinland-Palatinate” was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to The Zeit-Kurant, citing a military spokesperson.
This vessel had to join the Navy in 2014, but the troubled post delivery issues plagued this ambitious project’s fate.
The four Baden-Buertemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battle order of air defense and anti-ship missions as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
But constant delays mean that the advanced warships — which would somehow enable Germany to project power overseas — will already be obsolete by the time they enter service, called Die Zeit.
The disastrous F125 frigate arrived last year when the German Navy officially refused to employ the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Voss-skeepswerf in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a ship after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media has called that a number of essential — software and hardware defects — make the ship useless if it is deployed in a campaign.
Self-deficiencies are especially important as the Baden-Buertemberg class will handle vessels by a crew of about 120 mattresses — only half of the men's strength on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also revealed that the ship was drastically overweight, reducing the performance and reducing the fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons —Rheinland-Palatinate — are thought to be double as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price label for the entire project - including training the crew - also became a issue.
However, it has reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) — more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that have plagued the new frigates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy's ships that could be deployed are working on -
The official clothing officer said the issue worsened over time, because old ships were out of service, but no replacement vessels were provided.
He waved that none of Baden-Buertemberg-class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Fleet’s Secret Life
New research is being conducted on an estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual and soprano-wing bat as well as the brown language and Daubenton bats at Inverive Gardens in West Ross.
Special takers will be placed on the property in important locations to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also do mobile recordings by using hand indicators.
Experit sound analysis of all recordings will check the regularity of the bat calls and determine which species do.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation advisor for NTS hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat for the bats are most important and how it is used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture creation and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Fler mouse populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly during the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo orientation technique to show gog gas and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly do surveys and do sleeproom inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threeave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal site for them.
“Here at Threeve we have a wonderful area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, many veterans, and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to better understand what they need to flourish -
He emphasizes the need to search for bats before maintenance in properties is done because it is possible that ignorant destruction of a single creek can mean up to 400 females and little ones' death and can destroy an entire local population.
Fler mice are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to disrupt or prevent them, or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species, we don’t know how their populations are going -
Ronaldo completes rape protests while lawyers prepare to cover German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo ended rape protests against him as — false news — saying that people — themselves want to promote — by using his name.
His attorneys are ready to hand over German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forwarder was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to stay silent about the incident, reported Der Spiegel Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he addressed his 142 million followers, published hours after the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, concluded the reports as — false news —
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news, - the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that’s part of the whole thing.
I am a happy man and everything is right, - the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo’s attorney is preparing to deal with Der Spiegel on the claim, which they, according to Reuters, called —inlerable reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will claim compensation for — moral damages for any amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years —
The alleged incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her after anal, according to documents submitted to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Maiorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was -99 percent - a - good old - who was left in the heel by the -one percent -
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Maiorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a divorce outside the court because she was “fear of retaliating” and worried about becoming “publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the arrangement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault and moved this summer, in a €100 million deal to the Italian giant, Juve.
Brexit: UK will 'forever repent' if their car manufacturers lose it
The UK 'will forever repent' if they lose their status as world leader in car manufacturing to Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is “anxious” that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will have to stop production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a no-deal Brexit can cost posts.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union last year.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we’ll see how production is stopped in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have voiced fears about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will function.
BMW, for example, said they would close their mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line runs on a — just in time — basis, with parts that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruption on the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be discontinued.
Mr Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is — precisely calibrated to avoid those controls at the border -
“We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that, as I say, will allow us not only to enjoy the current success but for us to seize this opportunity,” he said to BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what was an extremely successful set of supply chains —
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped, but warned that added costs in the long term could reduce the investment's competitiveness and ultimately cost posts.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite Union’s co-founder at work, says: “In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back.
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed an exact and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU —
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed — with another week — while the fighting over nominee for the high court Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian election interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia and possible over-bombing of the law by the president.
Whether or not Trump is going to resign the Attorney General, and thereby threaten Mueller’s independence, Washington’s donations have been fueled for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a taker to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to thank.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York City, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would — choose not to — thank Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate court’s trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump launched a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for this has not yet been determined, it may be this week, I can see that it will be postponed with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always like to keep the press up-
Some journalists will differ with that statement: Sanders has not yet held a White House press information session since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of information sessions is not due to a hostility for TV journalists who are — impact-seeking — though she said: “I will not fight with the fact that they are impact-seeking —
She admitted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him,” she said, adding without citing evidence: “We looked at the numbers -
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but —if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly for the president of the United States, then it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot and you've seen it a lot in the past few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the President of the United States -
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press releases are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbonded and with times, bizarious appearance before journalists who were together.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express appreciation for the country and expressed the wish that they would remain after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed them to cover costs of negotiated status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government also strengthened their preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very stressful time for all of you.
That’s why I want to repeat how much I value each member’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
College gas from all over the EU and beyond, brings valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service’s work, and in which the patients and communities we serve benefit.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would like you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after major injury
Tennessee State Tigers' line player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he suffered a major injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury took place shortly before rest.
“He came to the sideline and sort of just collapsed there,” said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sideline before being placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is from the theatre at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is still no detail about the type/range of the injury — and Tennessee is still trying to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He died five times before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season to 18 dead.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal taxes when buying a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters
The seal tax will be charged on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to collect up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal taxes when they buy a property in the UK - with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be charged on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that the government’s plans will help to counter portlessness.
The additional tax — which is outside the current seal tax, including the higher levels set up two years ago on second houses and houses purchased to rent — can be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to bring in up to £120 million a year.
A estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are purchased by non-UK citizens who drive up prices and make it harder for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become - spook towns - due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a discount in seal tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by rapping land but not using it and encouraged Mrs. May to distance himself from quotas on affordable homes to restore Britain’s home disaster.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a striking series of predetermined housing improvements, including rental control and an end to “no-error suspensions”
He also wants to give greater power to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream — that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
But it may not be right that it is just as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies to buy homes as for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has become a far-fetched dream and the humiliation of impatience has been a too great reality -
Jack Ross: “My biggest ambition is to manage Scotland.”
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his greatest ambition is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scotland, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life into the North East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved this summer to the St. Mirren Stadium after returning to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I got the second team, but it was already, - Ross said to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
“But as a child, I often looked at Scotland with my father at Hampden, and that’s something that’s withdrawing me.
However, the opportunity can only come when I’m successful with club management -
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no fear of following such established names at such a large club after he had previously shown off offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, success will be measured for me by ‘‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it no doubt belongs in the Premier League, he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get it there, but I’ll probably just consider myself successful if I can get the club out there again —
Ross’s career in management is only three years old, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts’ coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and convert St Mirren from on the edge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he says, reflecting on how he took over Alloa’s leads.
“I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than playing.
It sounds bitar because I did good enough, made a reasonable existence from it, and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things that a person needs to come through weekly.
I’m still going through it with regard to the stress and pressure of the work, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to manage and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable I’ve been in my own skin throughout my adult life.

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 pm. on a Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s slumming bar income, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July - but receptions in restaurants declined by 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of business consulting company CGA, who compiled the figures, says: “Consistent sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a similar pattern than last month, June, when drinking places were at 2.8 percent, except for restaurants being hit even heavier.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant trading in June only worsened in July.
Drinking-run drinking places and bars did better at far better and rose more than restaurants had fallen.
Cos-led drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Right-hand managed bars and drinking places raised sales by 6.6 percent for the month, with food being down by three percent -
Paul Newman, of recreational and hospitality analysts RSM, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-the-house out-market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a decline in sales of 4.8 percent years a year will be particularly difficult above and beyond constant expense pressure.

One out of five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One out of five children — some as young as 11 — revealed a survey of secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers
Surveys of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in -false Insta pages -
The news has increased fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of learners say they have a “head account” to show to parents.
One out of five children — some as young as 11 — create social media accounts that keep them secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in — for example, Insta accounts — a reference to the Instagram photo-part site.
The news has increased fears that sexual content is being placed.
Twenty percent of learners said they had a clean-head account to show to parents, but also had private accounts.
One mother who came off her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site found a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them recognizing they have private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t track them —
Eilidh Doyle will be - voice for athletes - on Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the board’s general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated track-and-worker and chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her far-reaching experience at international level during the past decade.
“Eilidh has great respect for the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from what she brings to the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland —

Breast pump advertising that compares moms with cow divide opinions online
A breastpump company has shared opinions online with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows being milked.
To celebrate the lead of what is called the world’s first silently portable breast pump, consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-kiss music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the pump gives to mothers who milk out.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of straw and cow on the mate of a song that includes lyrics such as: “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see a tail — and — If you haven’t seen, it’s not onions, it’s my breasts —
The choir section reads: “Pomp it out, pump it out, I perform the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies —
But the advertising published on the firm’s Facebook page caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed response from viewers, with many saying that it is the “growels” of the dairy industry.
“Many poor decisions to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to milk to produce, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of birth, one wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly into a nutritional bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another noted: “Consciously, traumatizing for mom and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies -
Someone else added: “The ad is so out of feel-
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman acknowledging that the song was for her —screaming.
“I think it’s a genius idea.
I would have had one if I had always breastfeeded.
To make me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
It’s a great product, it’s one written.
Another noted: “It’s a fun advertisement directed at mothers who feel out milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and like —koeie.
It is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discrete pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is deadly, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a nutritional bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they milk out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD by Mother noted: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a large and exciting launch.
By drawing a parallel between women who milked out and dairy cow we wanted to put the out milking process and all its challenges in the spotlight, while in an entertaining way where people can find the wonderful feeling of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has got the news.
During London Modeweek, a mother of two appeared on the walking board for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children silently moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of sustained immigrant children has risen sharply even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to fierce rhetoric and policies set up by the Trump administration that make it more difficult to put children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be endangered by acting forward to demand a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households should submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs enforcement before Congress, testified that the agency had arrested thousands of people who had applied for unforgivable minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
“Amper 80 percent of individuals who are sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
That is why we continue to persecute those individuals, Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to advocate their case for legitimate status at an immigration judge.
Those who are considered inappropriate for emergency relief will soon be deported.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely it is that they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates say those concerns are increased at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child’s difficulty is more easily overlooked due to the size.
They added that to move the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good-bye to friends, the trauma can worsen that many are already struggling with.
Syria says to U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even if the country's war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign powers are illegal on Syrian soil, under the prowess to fight terrorism and will be “acted accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more disillusioned —at least by now.
He said that Damascus will continue — to wage this sacred battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories — of both terrorist groups and — any illegal foreign presence —
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mostly train and advise Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are in order for them to return, and he blamed —some Western countries - for spreading “irracial fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these return visits,” he said.
They are politicizing something that needs to be just a humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats have said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue with political controversies.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has rejected a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, emphasized that the agreement had — clear sperm — and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-connected Nusra Front that would be — wiped out.
UN Secretary, Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon call together the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to set up a post-war constitution for Syria and to run the way to elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee and said the panel’s work should be limited to the — following the articles of the present constitution — and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr Trump will win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusation and scandals its presidency ends early.
In what no doubt - the most dramatic finale of a presidency will ever be -
So far, there are no signs of viewerry.
Since 2014, peak time viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average 2.4 million peak time viewers, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s — The Rachel Maddow Show — are top cable viewers with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news evenings.
“This is a fire to which people have been attracted because it’s not something we understand,” says Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama — Designed Survivor — about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congressional building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, “Because he makes me laugh,” Scovell told me.
There’s fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or can reunite immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
To turn off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond just being an informed citizen when you are in the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts debate about Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background” from his book “Fear” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 Volstrus leather fly jacket — a garment thick of the hubris — The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels’ shocking descriptions of Mr Trump’s, um, anatomy.
I will never look at Super Mario again.
“Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he feeds you every evening,” says Brent Montgomery, head of the company of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the Trump program’s varying role distribution and daily kinkels in the plot (such as looking for a quarrel with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).
One cannot afford to miss one episode, otherwise you will stay behind.
When I reached for Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not tear him away, not with Brett Kavanaugh was on his way to appear before the Senate Court and the future of the High Court hanging in the scales.
“I remember when we did all those crazy programs at the time and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems they were right now.

Outdoor money flows to the most exciting mid-term selection betting in the house
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th saw an inflow of money, thanks to a shift in congressional districts that two officials are now in a race to have the same seat landed.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburgh district has measured democratic Rep. Conor Lamb — who won his seat in another district in a special election past spring — forces.
Lamb stands against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which heavily overlaps with the new 17th.
The cards were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally delineated in the Republican favor.
The race in the new 17th ended with a campaign funding competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Fielding Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Fielding Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a nail scrap win in a widely viewed special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador rather than supporting China, but then retreating back
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition to Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners suspended the Trump Organization’s management team.
Officials of the State Departments decided to call back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, said Heather Nauert, the Department’s spokesperson, earlier this month in a statement.
But fines were just considered against El Salvador that received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, which include reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level convention and focused on security and economic progress to follow up at a similar convention last year that was considered a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted Congress to continue effectively bringing an end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence has now been appointed to address the convention, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the assembly for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new bad news or strikes from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consultation on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analysis that was close to the administration and also talked about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that can happen may be the special consultation on Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possibleinvolvement of the law, of which there is now much significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller allegedly also focused his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia worked in the country's attack on our elections.
If Congress were to pass into other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face liability in that body, just when he was preparing to go back before the voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peer group.
It’s a lot of axes, and I don’t want to mention that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable — nor that of his peers in Europe.
There are decisions that must be taken on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will affect how much the battle can be stretched out.
In 1938, German officials were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, when the West just opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years’ slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and democracy’s relentless course is rushed or delayed.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What would we do if Mr. Trump dismissed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controlled the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been in hot water since this paper reported that he had proposed to keep the president secret last year and had speculated about whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times’ report is inaccurate.
How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly requested FBI investigation is not complete or fair — or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim election for a convention that will hold responsible for Mr. Trump?
If we watch those tests, there will be a long winter for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that lived in my ambassador's house at a time.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light up Sabbath candles on that table that carried the swastika.
With this as my origin, how can I not be an optimist about our future?

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistics for Rapid Vienna fight
Rangers play hosts for Rapid Vienna Thursday with the knowledge that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive equal impact in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance from the season to the 2-2 equal rash against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this rash as a place for bigger things.
“It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We entered the match with the belief that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Perhaps we could have won it at the end, but an equal count is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European day.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult game, because they had a good result in their last match, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a well-feeling factor at the site.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now push through, put past season behind us, and be successful -
Women lose sleep over this retirement couple's fear
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps to have the conversation,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You can’t prepare your family to take care if you don’t express your wishes long before the time.
Work with your counselor and your family to preach where and how to receive care, as those choices may be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor in: Your advisor can also help you get in with a way ahead of time to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid value-life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own capabilities - as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut down lawsuits at the pass.
Get a health care professional in place so you point out a trusted individual to monitor your medical care and ensure experts meet your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Also, be sure to pay for your finances.
You must choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unqualified.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play out those details in a written plan so you are ready.
“These are not just the financial issues that concern us, but who are the doctors, ask Martin.
What is the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that the plan is in place.
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with windbush
A man was shot several times with a windstorm when he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as an “eternal act.”
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life threatening, and the police have asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications being put outside action, emergency relief officers could not get any information from Donggala Regentship, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5-range shake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located at the point of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck them.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) coastline to the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The government, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and farming are the support pillars of the Central Sulawesi province’s economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times during the past 100 years by tsunamis, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific’s Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 that led to a tsunami that hit 14 countries led to 226 000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong shakes hit the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-range hit the south of Java, Indonesia was most populated island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused almost 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-range shake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-range shake hit one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, leading to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A level shake hit the Pidie Jaya Regentship in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shooting and tsunami in 2004.
This time it did not lead to a tsunami, but more than 100 were killed because of buildings that had fallen down.
2018: Great shakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The shake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-presidental candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report issued Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took a woman’s phone call from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pre-Requisition facility and is detained on a $500 unsecured deposit, reported KTUU.
He appeared in the court on Saturday, where he — innocuously, decided — when he was asked what he was pleading, reported the network.
Palin faces three class A violations, which means he can be locked up for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offence, punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2 000.
This is not the first time criminal complaints have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of Alaska's Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His wife said he had boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s behavior to Pittsburgh as a result of his duty in Iraq.
Indonesia Agriculture Tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-range earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been put out of action with death rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulated on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are seeking rare death sentence for suspects in NYC counterattack
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death sentence for Sayfulo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that caused eight people’s death — a rare punishment that has not yet been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan to moor pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his way in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov — deliberately killed the eight victims and deliberately committed serious physical injuries, according to the notification of intent to ask for the death penalty, submitted in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges carry possible death sentences, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal major jury struck Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder in behalf of extortion, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in organised crimes, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required — proper planning and prejudicial — prosecutors said and described Saipov’s way of performing it as “absolute, cruel and perverted”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” he said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York has criminally pursued a death sentence.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being sentenced to a conspiracy to carry out spying for the Soviet Union two years earlier during the cold war.
Albei Rosenberges was decommissioned with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He mentioned to delegations that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov said he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded innocently on the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said that they were, of course, disappointed with the prosecution’s decision.
“We think the decision to wish the death penalty rather than accept a debt recognition to life imprisonment with no possible release, only the trauma of these events will extend to all the involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked persecutors not to wish the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow to mobilize today — the people’s army — during a protest at the Tory Conference.
Former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the “hot” of Euroskeptics, since one of Theresa May’s own LPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back banker Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that by the time the UK was out, the UK was as Mr Farage Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May is to unite her deeply divided officers by encouraging pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan moving in the midst of attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Bondmates insisted that she would press by in her attempt to enter into an agreement with Brussels despite the death toll — and forced Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between her package and \"chaos\".
Mr Bone said for the Loop Term Loop Assembly in Solihull that he wanted to throw out —Chequers —
He suggested that Mr Farage should have made a nobleman and be given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were in control, we would have been out by the time,” he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to throw out Chequers.”
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought world wars to be in opposition.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone has been showing that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to stay is totally untrue.’
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: “I simply say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually bomb the streets and make sure we are chosen first.
Please let Chequers go and start listening.”
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: ‘First ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises.’
Mr. Farge told the assembly politicians that if they were on the threshold to violate the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they should feel the heat.
“It’s about a trust between us — the people — and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we won’t let you get away with it.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We mobilize the people’s army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-government, proud UK.”
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour convention in the city center.
A few activists dared Tories against Brexit banners after the introduction of the group this week.
Labourer Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application such as the conference opened.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is an overall wiser.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “look hard” to stand for President
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she will — looking forward to standing for president — not the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP state Rep Geoff Diehl who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She’s already in the middle of speculation that she might be going to challenge Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituencies using the city hall format since Trump was in power.
An attendant asked her if she was planning to stand for President.
Warren replied that it was time — for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and it includes a woman at all above -
Arrest made in shooting of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA., announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting incident Friday and asked for help to identify a man seen in the picture material.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University’s campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims had a shot wound in the head and was eventually killed as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on 247sports Saturday.
Wayde entered to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the scene, owned a weapon, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 youth raised in Baton Rouge played Sims in 32 games with 10 lead last season and he maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 back jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton clinched world title after team orders gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes’s team orders would play a major role in the recessions.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the wells and left Hamilton to drive all the way back in traffic, something that had to have been decisive.
The Mercedes put up a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton progressed to wheel-on-wheel action which the Ferrari driver saw against risk-free left the inside at risk of endurance to a double-motion to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the road jumping grid and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the giants as he held on to his bands to finish quickly and to pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have arrived at the wells on the 44th round, but could not speed up his pass in the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri did fantastic things all weekend and was a true master.
The team did exceptional work to have a one-two, Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday for not leaking Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing him of sexual assault by his High Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
The president spoke at a conference in West Virginia and did not directly address the testimony that Ford had given before the Senate Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were — common and innocent and liars.
“The one thing that can happen and the sweet thing that has gone on in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and common and liars,” he said.
“When you look at statements and leaks and then say they —oh, I haven’t done that.
I didn't do that -
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer...you leaked the document--o, o, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't like it -
Well, wait a little.
No, we didn’t like it, he added, in an instance of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter explaining the allegations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak had come down from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations. I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked —
But the president did not respect her denial well and commented on Saturday night’s convention: “I tell you what. It was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst language I’ve ever seen.
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of sexual misconduct and proposed that the Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the community, the injustice, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive to gain power and control,” Mediaites reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two targets for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars agreed for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-point lead by throws from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard equalized Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals captured their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who first lost matches and then won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth convention of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's open ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull help, with David Rutherford who had the help fielded when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break when he threw his second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again got them equal with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran stood up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game in the second half and he made sure of winning with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants who lost four of their last five games are home to Milton Keynes in their next game Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of aircraft can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people had been lifted up safely.
More than 800 people are killed and more are missing after a major earthquake Friday struck the island of Sulawesi, and caused a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area and many are trapped in demolitions in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that had swung heavily at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained immovable to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, was able to rise safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he day it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
Speaking for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts are broken to hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster relief agency that says access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“It is believed that the death toll continues to increase as many bodies are still under the construction valleys while many are still unable to reach,” agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached up to six meters, Palu dug that would hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and stock.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute brings in an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce.
The small ones are being looted orally.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is pursuing to help survivors, but we don’t know what to find there.
This is a tragedy, but it can get much worse.
Indonesia’s president, Yoko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military service: “I ask almaI of you to work day and night to complete every task related to cleansing.
You're ready - the CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year in which more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesia plane crash: Air New Guinea says one man is missing after beach more plane crash
The airline handling a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after they earlier said that all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said that they worked with local authorities, hospitals, and delegations to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable state.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane landed near the runway in the beach lake.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through deep water until the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the airstrikes had panicked and shouted and that he had committed a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that ships working close to the improvement of a key also used an inflatable boat with the rescue aid to get people to land again and again before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini has been involved in one.
Analysts set time line apart from evening when woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the reincarnation of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He set out for the jury how he used cell phone records to assemble the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from different phones showing that Tellis was together Chambers the night of her death, which was in opposition to his previous allegations, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis told the truth when he said he had been in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he —jok, because my move was in Nashville —
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that for a while after Chambers died, Tellis Chambers deleted messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He let her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense was scheduled to begin its closing Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative look of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop moved away from its origins of political messages and the approach to social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revision in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.

NY child girl depreciates couple because she has been dismissed after “racist” text
A New York child-sitter serves a couple for discriminatory resignation after she received a wrongly addressed message from the mother who complained that she was still a black person.
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the practice to “depression”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, sounded upset when she discovered that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEE NON-A SWART PERSON,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it twice to me Maurice.
After finding out her mistake, an “uncompromising” Plasco-Flaxman dismissed me Maurice and said that they were going to do bad work to a child girl who was African-American, and that she would rather expect a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day’s work and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice deposes the couple for damages over the resignation and seeks his damages to the amount of $350 per day for the six months, resident work for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t do such good,” she told and added the Post on Friday — I know it’s discrimination.
The couple retorted the claims that they were racist and said it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice’s employment and feared that they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She is not a racist.
We’re not racists, man Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were insolent, even if it was by a tube?
Your newborn baby?
Now, now,
Plasco compared the case to “impression” and said his wife would have had a baby in two months and was in a “very difficult situation”
“Are you going after a person?
It’s not a very nice thing to do, but the investment banker added.
While the case continues, the court of public opinion was quick to bring the couple to social media and cut them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not connect readers
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very enjoyable that we know of Paddington’s great success.
She said her father would have been furious if his job had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death last year —bitter sweet.
About Paddington, whom she described as a “very important member of our family,” she added that her father was still proud of his final success.
“He was quite a quiet man and he wasn’t an apple-gearing man,” she said.
“But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something: you’re proud of them, even if it’s not your job.
I think he saw Paddington’s success in that way.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself.
My daughter was going to die and I had to greet the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was chased to Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors labored anxiously to save her life.
“Nad often called to say that it was really bad, that they didn’t expect her to do it,” Mr. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I had to greet her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, heart lamb.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicine the doctors gave her to keep her heart on the beat was slowly getting up and leaving her system.
She died a while before she died, and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was unfolding.
I couldn’t dance or cry or cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together...
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was hurt at the time for the loss of her daughter, along with the other passengers on board, went on the plane - unaware of the temptation she had gone.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I had my head covered and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I've got on the flight a overwhelming sympathetic feeling for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her...
Tragic women post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been mailing cards for a while on a Wallic bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
My Davis son Tyler was 13 when he started leading depression and killed himself at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Me Davis, 45, lived in Lydney and said her son was a promising chief with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smiles were brighter than anything else.
However, he gave up work before he died because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after taking his own life.
Me Davis said: “I am still worried that there will be a domino effect.
Me Davis designed the cards, —to let people know that there are people out there who you can go to and who you can talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you have to talk -
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he felt sick or depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas — when the children opened their gifts, he did not make eye contact or something with them —
She said her death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: “It breaks a hole through the family.
This is tearing us apart.
But we all have to go and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still undisclosed as FBI investigation begins
“I thought if we could actually get something like what he was asking for — a timeless investigation that didn’t cover up — we might bring a bit of unity,” Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was going to “fall apart” under the most severe partition.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters have to investigate the FBI?
All of this is due to time calculation.
The interelections are only weeks away, on 6 November - if, as is expected, the Republicans fare badly, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to go to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI released its report?
There will be a voter in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get up to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a draw and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea overlap numbers ‘down’ under Kim
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislature said.
Park Byeong-sug quoted data from the South's Unification Cabinet and said that there were 1,127 riots last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher rates asked by human smokers has been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of refugees from the North are eventually offered South Korea civil law.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flight via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the high-protective demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreans.
China views the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically speaking in war with each other - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks centered around the strike negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unanimously disarm ourselves first,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh — historically — saying he is unqualified to serve at the High Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called High Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh — historically — and said he was temporarily unqualified to serve at the High Court.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman ever acted like that, they would say ‘histerically’ — Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Legal Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and at the time he was almost screaming and squeezing as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also expressly rejected Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a “ridiculous and coordinated character genocide” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
“I think he’s getting himself into those statements and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the House of Commons.
\"I'll say that -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not authorized to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court on which he is currently,\" Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Ommegang Appealhof.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Credible Care Act or Roe v. Wade as he is considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh raised questions about whether he would overthrow certain Supreme Court decisions.
“It’s not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘It’s not wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with this.
It’s a righteous diatribe, months and years’ anger that overcook, and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cried when we got angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, you do.
She continued, “I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive official, who also said that she cried when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, “You might think I’m sad because I cry.
I'm angry -
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant...
Trains are allowable as a partial exit for toom because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with nameless rage and being caught at my neck skin by an older woman - a cold driver for whom I was a little scared - who dragged me into a treportal.
“Never let them see you crying,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think that you are sad and will be happy because they have had an effect on you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the giants, my Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not run the idea that she could run for president.
“I didn’t think very well about the decision,” she said to me, laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it “Sneeze and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since it was late in the campaign, she was behind with finding sums and so she made a vow that she would not enter the res unless she had collected $2 million.
This was a lost battle.
She discovered that of her supporters who gave her $1,000 to men, only $250 would give her.
“I think I’m going to get off,” she wondered.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not lead a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - grateful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to target voters rather than delegates, and angry with sexism - that she had pitched.
You would have thought I had a nervous collapse, - recall me Schroeder about how the press responded to her.
“You thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
“She was crying,
How the U.S. China trade war might be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the trade war between the U.S. and China has been overwhelming and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 trillion (£150 trillion) items and effectively burdening half of the goods that come into the US from China.
Beijing took back goods every time and recently claped rates of five to ten percent on $60 trillion of US goods.
China has promised to equalize the US shot-for-shot and the world’s largest economy won’t move soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to hand over to requests, but to publicly comply with US requests will be too much of a tribute to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts still say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, pressure over US trade war over the long-term China can positively support by reducing the mutual dependence on the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that can start an economic toll flight in any one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have known before, said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria ‘prepared’ for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country improve.
“Today, the situation at ground level is more stable and secure due to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the one-sided economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the flatland land.
But he insisted that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that had secured the invasion.
Europe sealed Ryder cup victory in Paris
Span Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and won Spain U.S. with a final score of 16.5 by 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not yet won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had struggled for most of the tournament, had his T hold in the water at the par-3 16th hole and given his match to Francesco Molinari.
In all its rounds, the Italian golfer Molinari turned out to be one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament’s current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament's European winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t cry normally, but today I can’t help it.
It was a rough year.
Thank you so much for what Thomas has chosen me and in my faith.
I’m so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help, - said an emotional Garcia after European victory
He hands the box over to his countryman John Ram, who won in single game on Sunday US golfer Tiger Woods 2&1.
The incredible pride I feel, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at the old, 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder cup record.
A strange statistics by one of the biggest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Span U.S. struggled all week to find the cleanfield with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing execution on behalf of his team: “I am proud of these guys. They fought.
There was a bit of heat in Europe this morning.
We have broken it.
Take care of Thomas.
He is a wonderful captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup. I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to serve as their captain.
You have to keep your hat clean.
We are overwhelmed -
