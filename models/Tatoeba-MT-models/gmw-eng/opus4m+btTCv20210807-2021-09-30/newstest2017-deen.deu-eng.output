28-year-old cook found in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a local shopping center.
The victim’s brother said he could imagine no one who would harm him, “In the end, it went up again with him.”
The Leichnam found on Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the court medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigation was ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a cook in Boston, had performed his dream job six months ago as a cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were shocked and destroyed over his death.
“We’re a small team that works like a close family and we’re going to miss him painfully,” the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and our condolences are with Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank first lived in hostels, but that, \"the things for him finally went up.\"
“He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend,” Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
Connecting with his family was always something to cook us, prepare us dinner,” Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swam with the electricity.
“For everything that’s going on in the world, he was this unslipped diamond that shined brightly every day,” he said.
Anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD's reference phone under number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I am always in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood Star has now made this clear in an interview.
“I’m always stuck in drawers or I get sticked up from outside label, which usually has little to do with me and reality.”
“I don’t have the desire to be perfect and successful.
“Honestly, these things are much better for me.”
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at her being considered “misperfect,” as she explains in the current “Cosmopolitan”.
In fact, the actress spends her time at home, making television with loose dutt and Mexican food, she says in the magazine.
“We women don’t have to be married or have children to be perfect,” said the Hollywood Star.
In her new film Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game - Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse can be overlooked.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and a few colleagues were looking for a little difference with a ride out on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.
CHIO: \"Goldene Sport Pyramid\" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their night of celebration, and they chased home in the fast galopp to feed.
A mile at this pace, I was scared.
“It wasn’t a good experience,” Langer says.
And so the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was again near horses.
He was able to lead his family through the ALRV plant, and he did not even go for photo purposes on a horse.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid provided the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sport Pyramid as part of a small gala.
There is no lack of sympathetic athletes in awards.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions Tour Player of the Year...
Even the British Queen has already captured him.
Langer is the 18th prizer of the sports pyramid.
On Saturday, he met the first prizer, Hans Günter Winkler.
\"This award means a lot to me - says Langer - because it will be awarded not only for sporting successes but also for social engagement\"
For decades, Langer has been promoting young people.
And so he also passed on the price money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. master winner was included in the \"Hall of Fame of German Sport\" on Saturday.
The outstandings include the light athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fighter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Push and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahrer Meinhard Nemmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Spring Rider Alwin Shock mill and posthumous handballer Erhard.
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society moved to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept away from the big animals.
Clintons and Trump's Economic Policy: It's All About the Money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that is what Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two U.S. presidential candidates are not one in tax and energy policy as well as in a principle issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental and more philosophical difference.
The, on the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to control the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
On the other hand, he would be completely different, Trump says.
He’s going to go back to regulations massively, and he’s going to be strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to fulfill, he has opportunities to open up disadvantaged people and needs money for it.
That is why taxes would increase for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say almost the same thing.
The Democratic candidate even announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the Republican State-critical Tea Party.
So, on Trump, there could still be internal discussions.
More significant are the differences in energy and climate policy.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and to raise coal emissions in the U.S. again.
Oil promotion is also supposed to be possible in protected areas, and the Paris Climate Protection Agreement wants to announce it.
Clinton, on the other hand, expressly wants to expand renewable energies with its investment program and demands: \"A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs.\"
“It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be it.”
However, not only in infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both of us do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.
They should be paid better, for example, Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not very clear: once he says, the minimum wage must be raw, then he says he cannot be changed.
However, the major discussion of the coming months may be about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens, stands to boost growth.
His critics tell him that the budget deficit would only be greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich, is willing to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: More taxes are also not the solution.
“Every refugee woman has experience with sexual violence.”
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who flee by themselves.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby, which is not more than a year old.
One of them put her little son in the arm.
He looks curious in the room with great eyes.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realizes that she is being observed.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene is normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the branch manager of Condrobs, a social support provider in Bavaria, and is concerned with the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single-fleet women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs established the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's aid.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
“It’s not exaggerating to say that every woman who arrives here has had sexual violence on her escape,” Bahr says.
“People flee for wars because they are persecuted politically, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a hope-bearer,” she says.
In women, there are other reasons for fleeing: “Many steal from it secretly because they see no other way out.”
In their home they have made experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives her on.
On the run it goes on.
“For example, that sipper for a bottle of water requires a sexual action is not a rare thing,” Bahr says.
And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that this ends as soon as they arrive in Germany, mistakenly, tells Bahr.
Even here, single women in refugee homes would often be considered inferior and abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of women living in the Münchenn northern accommodation are traumatized, they estimate.
“Some of the children were not created voluntarily,” he said.
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
\"Or they don't trust themselves to speak openly about the victim because the shame is too big.\"
Since they often don't know how to help themselves, more accommodation is needed only for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
On the question of whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction area, some responded with no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Palatinate there is no such thing in the homes of the governments.
Even in Swabia, displaced women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government press spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle France, there are floors or private homes for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men in the European Parliament.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: “It is very important for men and women to be accommodated separately.”
“If privacy or if men and women are accommodated together, it may come to - ongoing - violence against women”
Especially the washrooms should be separate and easy for women to access, is the study.
How much the women feel about this need for protection can be read at the Andang, which is located on the house in Munich.
“Since we’ve talked about it, we’ve got a long waiting list,” Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant physicians strike: requirements for new work combat measures
Deputy representatives of the Assistant Doctors have called on their union to approve new work-fighting measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has requested its entire Council to approve more work campaign measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said it had failed to respond to the concerns regarding the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA in July.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members who were posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would remain “remain calm” to problems, leading to the rejection of the contract.
“In view of this,” she said, “the JDC Board has voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and to demand official renegotiations on all your concerns.
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board today has made a formal application for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a ongoing programme of escalating work combat measures starting in early September.
The disputes led assistant physicians to strike six times this year, the first total failure in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Assistant Doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of contract recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings held by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students before voting that the contract should be advantageous and accepted.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the Treaty for Doctors in England would be bindingly introduced.
Russia and Turkey: An Alliance of Outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the goldy hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can’t imagine how Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handcuff, yes.
But Putin’s smile worked narrowly, and he hardly gave out heat, even for his holding back conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his dear friend, Putin, according to a report a whole five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have felt as if something bad had never happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me to indicate the opposite.
But one of Putin’s broadcast, sustainable cools showed that Russia’s head of state had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the delegation of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's response at the time was blazing.
Putin split up and accused Ankara of falling Russia in the back.
The offense was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult if not impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.
At one time it seemed as if the Turks were going to bear the blame for everything.
The most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by so-called Islamic state.
He objected to this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan the apology he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to win some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clearly on hand.
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after being fired at a failed state strike almost to his office last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have severely affected Turkey, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, travel organisers and charter companies will be made easier if the flights are resumed.
They count on a late-season response to the Mediterranean.
This week, the state television forecasted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti made it this way: “Tourists there long, tomatoes here for a long time.
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West, as its response to the attempted power acquisition is considered a weak answer.
This is due to the continuing groll over the screw pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is supposed to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the west.
In Ankara, the Russian head of state won a bonus to securely call for support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is a natural fact for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime changes.
The summit at this glorious palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present one, as an analyst once described to me, “Allianz from outsiders”: two countries that are breaking from the west and feel badly treated and are now allying.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as peace founder, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It may be significant that after nearly three hours of first talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they had not even stripped the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus as to where a common name can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shoots down the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again.
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
The RBS brand is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank’s chief of directors.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected to the bank’s global ambitions.
Since then, the bank has been disbanding when it had to be nearly collapsing and saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand-strates “RBS” have used to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, decentral headquarters and stock exchange notation will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit by customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we become more a bank of brands now.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I now say that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the veracity of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to develop into the brand’s bank because how we focus on the inside (we’ve asked) to make it a better bank for customers,” the chief executive said.
It would have been very cynic three years ago if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori reaches his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays Champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000 wins
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000 UK profits at Newmarket on Friday.
He sat on predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won on Ghayyar before, said, \"It's something special.\"
I am very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I'm comfortable and very modest.
Dettori takes up the cheer when he gets the victory on predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-year-old winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that has only a few in front of him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that sets him apart from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma have been excited fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already gained 6,000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been a winner in GB for nearly 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the hanging shield of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A wide range of major tournament wins, including his famous “Glorious Sevens” in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an aircraft crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially had difficulty returning from his six-month-old lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to face his twins and return to his best form.
And he's not been in the end for a long time - Dettori once said he wants to continue at competitions until he's at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin’s closest trust circle for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed a special employee for environmental and transport matters.
In a Kremlin opinion, Putin, without stating reasons, has appointed Ivanov's resignation from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration,
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin website, it is mentioned (in Russian) that he later served as chief of the Protocol and chief of staff.
He said to Putin: “Thank you for your trust.”
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state with regard to legislation drafts and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Convince the smiling faces?
This step has made Moscow secretive.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest trustees to Vladimir Putins for a long time and worked as he did for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned on their own behalf.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
No one knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president wants to lead the Russian environmental policy at once - was on the verge of scepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, “It’s true that I asked you in a conversation in early 2012 to trust me this very complicated post — you might say almost — complaining posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took over the post in December 2011.
He was previously deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed deputy.
As Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he was most familiar with.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third term of office would have violated Putin's constitution.
But this post was taken by another nearby ally Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming President three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson Fired After Killing Producers
Gibson was involved in a physical conflict in the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios producing the series announced its termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his announcement.
At the set, there were artistic differences and disagreements.
I regret the incident,” he said in a statement.
Details of how the character Gibsons is written out from the series that follows a team of FBI agents are expected to be released at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who had previously played in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been involved in the series since its first season in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have been pouring in my whole heart blood for the last 12 years,” Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the 12th staff will be set to 28 September.
Puzzles about fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff requested help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals that were spun by a spring well.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone might cast some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected with Fife
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossing with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the “deck blasts” that approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 screw ropes.
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.
Economic Minister Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, “This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a hectic activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are in their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete cast for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge in its place.
Michael Martin, project director of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: “The first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-looking high and deep construction.
After the installation of the last road cover section and its connection with the north tower deck located in the extension, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or country side.
This was achieved by drawing the northern supply bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very hectic activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an increase of about 3%.
Heike, since the tolerances the team was working on were tiny - on each side, they were only a few millimetres.
Fortunately everything was very good.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three Men Have \"Happy to Be Still Living\"
Three men have \"happiness still to be alive\" after being thrown by their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station hit 13:20 BST alarm on Friday after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely as their boat moved on from their own strength.
“We saw how the boat turned around in their vicinity and presented ourselves the worst,” said Moelfre Vince Jones’s head of rescue station.
“Happyly, the strong winds have already waved the boat beyond its reach until we left it to water,” he added.
Two of the men were rescued from a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boje without a rescue.
They came all on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said: “The three men who were thrown into the water have luck to be unharmed and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it was released by the person who controlled the boat when the boat was aware of the boat.
Someone has been waiting for these men today.
He is seriously injured - man is on his ex-girlfriend.
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As police announced yesterday, the 50-year-old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholized perpetrators cut the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When he came to the apartment, he visited her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured at hand and body.
Police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
During the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
He then alarmed his sister.
Together with her companion, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
But she could not move him to leave the apartment.
That is why she went out of the house with her partner.
On the street they met the man's ex-life companion.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old moved his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens mean that investors are to be taken much more seriously in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes living at the next meeting of the Council, a concept of employment.
But dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: Who should actually build the cheap apartments?
There has been a lack of control so far.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: “We agree with the Greens: Who wants to build on urban areas, in the future has to identify 20 percent of all housing as social housing.
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock.
However, the main point of dispute in the town hall is, says Bratmann: “How to deal with investors who want to build on private land”
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as many as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing.”
A new urban housing support program, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: “There is no agreement between the groups at the moment.”
The CDU wants to make investors as few as possible rules.
The left will still have tough claims for investors.
Regardless of what Bratmann said, there was an increase in the situation in the housing market.
When the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff are needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.
However, the program is not complete: because the around 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do you compare the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments, whose promotion will run out in the next few years?
By 2020, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm said that now running ties should be purchased from the city.
In addition, it would be necessary to consider getting apartments back into the price bond.
This is possible in the western city.
At one stroke, the problem was solved.
Because in the West City, there are time limits at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be taken back to the price line for cheap apartments.
Only: This is what the owners, the housing companies do not want.
Because the number of social apartments in the West City is increased dramatically again, one is removed from the target of so-called mixing.
There is no longer a concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group Chairman Holger Herlitschke says: “For a broad majority, the CDU must be in the boat.
This has focused on more buildings for single-family homes.
What does not mean, however, that no compromise can be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness worth
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring at screens has been complained of by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and making them more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the television, then to video games and last to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and activities in the open are not exclusive to each other.
I am referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs developed).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest in the release of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand that overburdened the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokémons, who are being chased by a GPS and, once they have been found, \"photographed\" (over a screenshot on the cell phone) or \"captured\".
A generation who played the game when she was younger joined the insanity and jumped for the search of sofa.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps that the “ average” person sets aside every day.
Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days after the game’s launch, the number of persecuted people who train 30 minutes each day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public education campaigns on health, which people want to bring to it - take 30 minutes to come from Sofa - and \"be active every day - shoot at deaf ears, because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.
Physical actuation helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it causes people to do something outside that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships on hunting.
As always, there are also mürrical gamers who must always complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's that?
A breakthrough has occurred.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game.
The new one will lose its appeal and its use will fail over time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world, helping many people to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles wins gold in the women's tournament
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is on all the immune system.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
Make no effort on the bar.
Breathing on the ground.
On two lines brilliant.
And finally, the Olympics too.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American tournament climbed to the multi-fight title and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the headlight of the Olympic Games.
Her total result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and final five teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American women Simone Biles competed at the swimming bar during the women's single-sea combat final in the art tournament at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-fight title and a total of the fifth as she solidifies her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment found an end.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 World Championship Medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is “the best tournament I’ve ever seen”
She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of over-dimensional expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.
The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hugged each other after winning gold and silver in the women's singles competition final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as a callsign at the retirement party of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never having the future planned during her long journey, this is not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - which include their typical Tumbling Pass - are adapted to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympiarena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child, and trained by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the Turnhall, in which Boorman became a force.
Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more combat competition, a series of victories that will last as long as she wishes.
Although Mustafina was easily guided by two rotations, the image was carried.
Sweater bars and ground turns - in which Biles holds the World Championship title - laurel.
She picked up on the swimming bar again with 15,433, and placed one on the ground with a 15,933.
Raisman gently embraced her as they expected her final bout - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles bright red, white, and blue eyeliners, when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
The Raismans performance was a revenge for the last four years when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called by the Americans — Oma — had a lead.
After her ground exercise, she assigned kiss hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared questionable.
As for Biles, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has an entirely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial murder in the car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of Phoenix's most deadly attacks since a decade in the first Phoenix serial murder while they were in the car and heard music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in an entrance, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while he was on the side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
Police reported that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the grown victims.
Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard’s police spokesman said the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two more injured in Hispanic residential areas within four months in nine attacks.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of a house,” Howard told the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence which led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized and later died due to her injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah still die on the scene.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also released a police report on the shooting that targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and that it is assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.
Researchers found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: “It’s getting better”
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund microcephalia, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was, I don't create it.
I don't do that.
I didn't get into it.
What's wrong -- of course, you've got to do it,\" she said.
Her husband Vincent and her have been told that Edmund will never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize him.
“My first answer was ‘I didn’t know that people are still doing,’” Picciuto said.
Edmund can run with help.
Edmund was unable to sit or scrape until his third year of life, and he still cannot speak.
But he progresses slowly.
He can walk with support and cycle.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund used for \"Please sing me something before - designed -
“We teach him sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters alone.
Microcephalia has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as measles or Zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is still too early to tell how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I always asked what would happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven’t asked for the forecast for a long time because I don’t expect someone to tell me.
But Picciuto has a disastrous advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zikavirus.
It's getting better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding gives occasion for rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Great rainfall and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the state of emergency on Friday, and more rainfall is expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the south of Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards stated that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the move to help with the communities concerned.
Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, announced that the requests for flood vehicles, boats, and sandbags increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested tens of thousands of sand bags.
A flood warning system is used over large parts in southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall.
In southern Alabama, a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels after the weekend.
The meter-eologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a current down-to-date flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these rivers will only flow slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 09.00 ever recorded.
Rescue teams still water people from the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the south-west of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and his stepson were among those who were rescued on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rises greatly overnight.
He said he had warned him of another stepson who lives nearby.
“We woke up and the water flowed and flowed in,” Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife, Hansford, said she had never seen such an elevation of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency rescuers had saved all three in a large military truck and had taken them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had spread “slowly,” as there were still heavy rainfall and that authorities are considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer reported near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that the ground had been significantly completed by the rainfall since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that heavy rains and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and a drop in education in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a by-order in Tangipahoa indicated 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both of which were now flooded.
The head of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets who had been washed by the floodwaters.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency homes were established to accommodate the evacuees.
“As soon as the water starts to return, they will be able to return to their homes,” he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents who hoped to keep the water from their homes and shops.
“The last major flooding we had was in March,” Lacy Landrum said.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of homes should have been reported to have been reported to be flooded on Thursday, but no one has been reported until Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and it’s still coming.”
Mahaj Brown, 6, 'during bullets' survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boy’s grandparents identified him with CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries, including in the loins, legs, arm, and belly, but that he was aware of his transportation to the hospital.
“He’s been through a lot, his small body was licked by bullets,” his grandmother Delores Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe that.
The boy’s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy’s family told the transmitter that he was expected to be healed again.
He should have started the first class in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot on the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in a critical state, the transmitter reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were determined whether they could be among one of the injured men of the perpetrators.
investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there had apparently been a crossfire between several gunmen.
Patron sleeves for storm rifles that were traced back to various storm guns overlooked the site.
It seems that this has clearly been a continuing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the road, were the sleeves.
So there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved here,” police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station in Philadelphia.
Several homes and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently checking reports according to the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross-beater at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine under the women's Olympic team in the tournament and that for more than one reason.
I have been with every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren's 'Laurie' Hernandez, which have been inspiring to many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, which is Aly Raisman, who is a Jew and rounds off Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among female tournaments has been an African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gymstic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fight event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the tip of this sport, but so do not look like turnclasses across the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.
They are the “Last Five” because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the team, and this is also the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But reality looks like turning is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private tournaments held by parents who come up for the training, decorating, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their Turner and families). The list can continue anyway.
The majority of these tournaments are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the Turner receives their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
We need to allow the communities of aun countless, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to have a more easily accessible and easily accessible turn-train.
I founded my 20-year-old turn Foundation.
At my events, we offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide the youth with high quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as school and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in turning, and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of “Girl Power” by holding the Olympic team gold and thanking her so many young girls motivated with different backgrounds to begin their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after refusing Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election refused.
In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to enter into the contract and said that the NHS was in a “no-man’s country” and would damage any further delay for the staff and patients.
The first assistant physicians are expected to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Medicines, announced last night in a statement: “Assistent doctors have continued to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will raise the current crisis of staff and that it will be reluctant to treat all doctors justly.
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes by speaking in opposition to the government and sometimes silenced on hearings.
That happened to one promise that Jeremy Hunt had made last month about his door being always open.
“Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the pressure and address the concerns of the assistant doctors.
If he does not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work combat measures.
The last strike at the end of April saw a shift of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and medical professionals were included in order to provide doctors on the strike post chain coverage.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the reformed contract with the British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants a better weekly reward for the 54,000 assistant physicians who are subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of the NHS staff, urged the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: “Work-fighting measures do not achieve anything of the few, but have already overburdened teams and service providers and only provide the patients, caregivers and their families with concerns, needs and interruptions.
In the last two months, we have talked to the Committee of Assistant Doctors and have responded to the Ministry of Health and other ministry positively to the concerns relating to prudence and whistleblowing.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as sending, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional out-time, training box, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education vacations and gender-specific pay cases in medicine - was a sign of how serious it was for employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-per day drug after the authorities have been advised to administer this more people for a longer period of time.
The healing drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attack for individuals with heart disease.
The drug has been administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or a further heart attack.
The NHS regulatory authority has recommended a four-year admission to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulatory authority has recommended a four-year admission to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by collections of fatty materials in the arterial walls that form coatings.
When the coating breaks apart, it can cause a blood cell that clogs the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.
If the blood gland dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the UK company AstraZeneca and sold under the brand name Brillique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood vessels more unlikely.
The NICE manual, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: “Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack, have another heart attack or stroke — often with desastrous consequences —
Fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attack and stroke in people who have already had heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The manual does not recommend treatment that goes beyond that period.
Culture of Political Correction leaves election fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the occasion of a government report due to corruption from office
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities knowingly ignored as a destructive government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles has verbally attacked police, electoral observers and councillors to have ignored evidence of election abuse due to “oversensitive ethnic and religious differences.”
The former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the deterrence of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut-off tapes outside of electoral cabinets to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry an ID with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections.
At present, a voter must only name his name and address.
The report suggests that non-removeable ink is applied to a person’s finger when they hand out their vote to prevent someone from electing twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He demands that the press have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official commissions or working groups.
“Not only does this serve as a protection against electoral fraud, but it is also intended to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture involved,” he said.
The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandals in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the acting mayor Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community “in a cynical way” and that he had silenced his critics with Rassissmus and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman is said to have “led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him.”
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a follow-up in which one person chose as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed himself in particular alarmingly for the fraudulent election of letters - when the older members of the Muslim community pressured people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including leading identification to prove identity
In his report, he said: “As evidence was applied, pressure was placed on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
“There were concerns that... state institutions had been knowingly ignoring such behavior because of “politically correct” hypersensibilities regarding ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric spoke out 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban on political activists to edit letter-election documents to stop \"elections\".
The report, taken into account by Theresa May, also requires harder registration checks to prevent the election directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing for your ID.
Do not use removeable ink on a person’s finger once she has given off her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit to applications for an automatic letter choice.
Ban political activists from editing full letter choices and envelopes of letter choices.
The police have the authority to set up closures for electoral stations.
A legislative change that facilitates an indictment charge in accordance with the Representative of the People Act 1983.
Photographer ban in electoral stations.
Request that only English be used in the electoral stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the electoral cabinet alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it “surprising” that after the Tower Hamlets case, no criminal notice was issued.
“The Court of Appeal has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be impeccable because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices,” he said.
Because of a number of reasons for sufficient, in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings, he was found guilty.
He also criticises the ineffective “abhak controls” of the city hall’s electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: “The Court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, bears a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and rejection of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Prejudiced by Kates Radler-Doppelganger and other famous doubles from Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have been advised this week about French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot except Rand and Band, who has proved to be an impressive double-man of the Duke of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is by far not the only gold-fighting athlete to have his own famous doubles, at least not if you can give the social media faith.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flashing on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than a few similarities to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the Wolf: team member of the U.S. team in bow shooting Brady Ellison, left, is compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate’s double driver on the bike track, many people on the internet point out how a certain archer of the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio might be.
The team member of the U.S. team in archery shooting Brady Ellison has caused an insurgency on Twitter after showing pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star secretly.
In fact, the archer got mad at the social media and admitted that he had already heard since his childhood that he looked like Leo.
“I see no great similarity in myself except face hair,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
“He’s a good-looking guy, so I think it’s a compliment.
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly go even further this year: the striking similarity between British far-flunger Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with her large, impressive eyes is intended to be a double-man for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
This user considers Nathan to be the “athletic version” of the Inception Actor.
Another persistent comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just the sun-brown skin and blond hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans, an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.
Strong women: football star Hope solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only thing: A Twitter user was very happy about the fact that others noticed the similarities as well.
Theory put into space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained to her satisfaction that “the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical.”
In fact, U.S. football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney and the gold medal winner in the tournament Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, broad smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer “like a pig has died”
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr 4x200m freestyle swimming staff offended viewers of the CBC live transmission of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer \"was going off like Mief\" and died like a pig during the race.
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was disabled when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming staff.
MacDonald, who was caught on board in the CBS’s commentator team to give more “colors,” could be heard saying, “This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby.”
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of swimming staff 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canadians to unlock the gap to China.
viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, “Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China —who died like a pig —??????
The Idiot didn't captivate that they were still on the show -
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming staff for women: \"This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby -
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, where many of them spoke.
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: “Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, \"We apologize that the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance.\"
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, it makes us sorry that it happened.
CBC apologized more than 90 times to the people who responded to the notice via Twitter
Commentary colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was allowed to be broadcast.
Last night we quickly apologized to our viewers on broadcast and to our followers in social media.
To clarify one, Byron’s comments refer to the performance of the swimmer and not to them as a person.
However, they were inappropriate and an unhappyly chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his remarks by stating that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack.
“I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women’s swimming staff in the CBC Olympic broadcast,” he said.
“I have been referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to him as a person.”
Of course, no contempt was intended and I am very sorry.
Purchasers in Primark are angry about women trying shameless underwear in the middle of the business
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a primark to try underhoses.
To make the situation worse, she patterned as she looked in it, pulled it out and put it back into the shelf.
She continued to shop and sampled four pairs of underhoses in a store at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underhoses before putting them back to the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, “she turned on herself and left the business without buying anything.”
She said, “People couldn’t believe what they saw.”
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took out a pair of underhoses, pulled out her own tight pants and pants, and tried them.
“She didn’t even try to find a more discrete place to do it - she just stood there, frankly like Oskar.”
“Everyone stared when she pulled out the underhoses that obviously didn’t please her, as she put them back into the shelf.”
She repeated the same thing with three other underhoses before finally deciding that she didn’t like anything, looked back and went out.
“They didn’t seem to bother someone she watched — or think about the person who might buy the underhoses she had tried —”
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “How repugnant to think that someone would take underhoses home that someone else had touched and that wasn’t washed.”
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: “As I came along, the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she went - which is as good as it is.”
“I would hate going home with a new pair of underhoses and finding out that another woman had attacked them and pulled them out again and they were not washed.”
A Primark spokesperson said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9, at our branch in Folkstone.
All products in question have been pulled out of sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a major of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
Regardless of whether you approach yourself from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear around for your robber.
When you approach you from the back, you should turn around first, so that you can see your attacker and “get out of the shot line,” Mizrachi says.
Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.
Then hit him with the knee in the key and twist him, while the attacker is squeezing himself in pain, the gun is thrown out of his hands. Get him to the face with the run and move back as they direct the weapon towards him.
In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line, take the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, put the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his handle before moving backward and directing the weapon towards him.
Does it sound difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mizrachi.
But remember that it’s safest in a robbery to spend your money — unless you’re a Krav Maga Grand Master.
Traveler Ian Wright works his tongue for a travel guide in the most dirty places in Europe.
A British traveller underwent a serious examination of his immune system and a resentful flexibility by exposing some of the most dirty and eclectic places in Europe.
The Moderator and Traveling Author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, built his trains on a euro screen, a landed at Piccadilly Circus, a sink button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.
Before leaking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will be in.
But the experiment filmed under the title “The Lickhiker’s Guide to Inner Strength” brought some surprising results to the daylight.
The idea of pulling off the sinking button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestine bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left behind what he had fallen, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the resistance of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating unique and wonderful things.
From public stations to toilet sinks, his immune system was definitely under a sample.
In the film, he said: “Prepared as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water.”
In the film, he was absolutely justified in his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
Its sample section showed a luminometer number of over 4,000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of newly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to pull off after its luminometer number was over 4,000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film “The Lickhiker’s Guide to Inner Strength” which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, “This is the worst thing I’ve ever smelled in a toilet.”
There is nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to look at anything here, because it's a bad thing in here.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company will be starring Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both fatty acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestine bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstormings that ended with us saying, “Let’s call us Ian.”
They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “Let me say it that way — I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had leaked some of the things I had been instructed to lick him, like the ugly Russian toilet shown in the film.”
Of course, there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to attract them and others in which this was quite difficult.
I'm glad that we've included some of these dirty delights on film.\"
In a 2015 study conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all surveyed dairy acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing added fatty acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before deloging Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social apartment after a deloging with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being violently removed from their estate, shocked employees of the housing company found property in an ireparable state.
The walls show clumsy holes, wooden parts were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the home administration at Cornwall Housing, said she fears that the apartment is no longer to be repaired.
She said, “It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don’t have to live this way.
There are many things to consider as this property is probably considered not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who were temporarily living in the apartment and the police said that the terror the family had added included street fights with baseball strikers, intruders from residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, quarrels and escapes.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down, old trash was found
In the estate in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden parts were torn up
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to call police regularly
Cornwall Housing deloged to her and her partner this week violently from the estate after giving them an extended 11-week term to volunteer out.
The delagation was cheered by relieved neighbors who said their lives were made hell.
One of them said, “They didn’t care about anybody.”
We lived for 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
“Today morning we couldn’t sleep.”
We stood up because it was so quiet here - that's not what we were used to!
Now, where they're finally gone, it'll be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it had abandoned the family to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years
On the supervised side of the municipal house, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: “It is a shame that the tenant has neglected to accept any responsibility for her behavior and that of her family, as a delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into account.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police have done as well as members of the community who courageously went to us and let us know.
I hope this development will bring comfort to some neighbors and convey the message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after deloging on the ground
Workers of the House Administration will now have to leave Müllerberge, which surrounds the house
In 2014, police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after being guilty of possession of a drug of Class B in commercial intent.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were decorated with graffiti.
Police say they will delog tenants who do not adhere to the house order
Angela Crow from the Devon and Cornwall police said that the deloging was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not adhere to the house order.
“This is true of those who think they can take care of themselves without self-promotions and those who have been harmed by such behavior,” she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a deep-flying military jet overruns beach
Sun Worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the air forces set off an incredible crash flight
The Air Forces stated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a deep-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew almost in tangible proximity over the sun’s services on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidayers sprang up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle drives without first seeing what had come up to them through the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidayers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: “It really flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was falling down.”
Nuno Arroja added: “I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me.”
Tourists at the beach of Aveiro were in panic when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Forces today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that due to the poor visibility of the jet, the area fires nearby flew slightly deeper than usual, but the air forces insisted that safety was not at any time endangered.
Land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people on the island of Madeira also died.
The Portuguese Air Forces today stated that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - that limited his vision
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worry against Seville
Seville - The FC Barcelona fights for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans enter the duel around the Spanish supercup out against FC Sevilla, the back game rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double-winner must, among other things, reject Neymar, who competes with Brazil’s Olympic football tournament, with the lower Cup finalist and reigning Europe League champion.
Also, goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is missing.
In training, the German has suffered a strapping in the knee, so the one question at Barca has been clarified at least first in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stäten have been betting in Barcelona for two years for the status as a number one.
Coach Luis Enrique so far rejected a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stägen in most other applications.
Before the first game of the new season, there is doubt about the team’s fitness state, which was humiliated in a Liverpool test game on Saturday with 0:4.
Even at 3:2 in the Probegalopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. were not really convinced yet.
Seville in turn has the 2:3 defeat after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid, and strives for the second triumph at the Supercopa de Espana.
Barcelona has 11 successes of record winners in this competition.
Ma Long in his own league on table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympics.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and title defender Zhang Jike 4:0 in a one-sided final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
The world rankings-first brought the \"Golden Grand Slam\" with success at WM, World Cup, World Tour Final Tournament and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese succeeded as expected in the final game and made up the title among themselves.
It was clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic draw was the former SVS NÖ Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the sets and on time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the tribunes and left their guardians alone in the fair competition.
“The matches until here I played for my country.”
“I play for myself in the final,” Zhang said.
After the match, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpected one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that, he determined the pace on the plate and left Zhang down only 13 points.
Because of Ma's superiority, it didn't develop the expected elusive match.
However, nothing was done to see enough stunning ball changes.
Mizutani won the game for bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter-final against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the Belarusian had a rib injury, then in medical treatment, had to enjoy sheet metal.
The Swedish Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008), by the way, had become Olympic fourth in a similar high table tennis age.
Donald Trump's \"violent problems\" in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by a massive concern that traditional conservative states will also use their majority.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republican high-level Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally large-scale and confident multimillionaire expressed such concerns as correspondents reported.
After he threw 16 rivals into his own Republican camp out of the race, the doubt of his success in the fight for the White House grew.
“We have huge problems in Utah,” Trump told evangelical Christians, asking for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida, or Virginia.
Blaming false reports about his candidacy, he re-recorded his well-known media shell.
the Vulnerable Republique
Utah is usually a secure bank for Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his competitor from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on the same track.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered dangerous.
In an interview by CNBC’s broadcaster, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton’s advance: “Genauso, as I have done so before.”
And after that: This will either be successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday.
He did nothing but “to tell the truth.”
If it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, be it all right, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party is supposed to have threatened to strike funds to support its election campaign, he should not be able to present better poll values.
Instead, the Republicans’ candidates for Congress are more likely to be among the poor.
Olympia: Three-star fraud at Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary Commission on the case.
Kenya's lightweight athletes are threatening after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Ungemach.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced, immediately setting up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village gave a urine sample under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This has been reported to Kenya's team of Doping controllers.
The World Association of IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to pursue its own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson said.
“Depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, IAAF will make an assessment,” IAAF said in an IAAF statement.
“He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and released as Ferguson Rotich, who gave the sample and signed it,” said Kenya’s Chief of Mission Stephan Arab Soi.
He was in possession of the Accreditation of the Athlete, which was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing World Cup in 2015.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan Athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been decommissioned from the Rio Games.
He is expected to have informed his country’s sportsmen about upcoming doping tests.
According to media reports, he was to be arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation for a long time after numerous doping proceedings at IOC.
In announcing the more than 2000 doping target controls imposed by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusually previously noted that special athletes from Kenya and Russia are being taken into sight.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system before the summer games in Brazil.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of Olympia.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping fighting is in accordance with WADA’s rules.
Kenya is considered a major runner nation.
The nation's lightweight athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of ARD television reports, allegations have been repeatedly raised that in Kenya doping centers are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had employed them in Russian athletics.
In this case, it could be proven that in this type of sport, surface-covering and systematic was observed.
Russia's athletics were excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger - West Side Story - with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare’s year, the Salzburg Festivals present the “West Side Story” with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the West Side Story - Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classics and fulfilled the role of Maria a youth dream.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra, led by Venezonal conductor Gustavo Dudamel, says: “This music is full of rhythms, he swears.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this scene, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because it is musically exceptional!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says in her song: “I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright”
So she is smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
“She is very similar to me, my Italian character, whom I have as a Roman,” Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: \"Cecilia is a wonderful artist -
It is such an honor to work with her.
She's a very generous man.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: “Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate.
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of its movements, in its views, it is its life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the “West Side Story” is up-to-date: “This piece is about prejudices and fanaticism.”
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans have gone to New York, and the New York residents don't want them.
These are the same topics, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirls who joined IS were killed in Syria
Kadisa Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, has been reportedly killed in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the group’s bowlwork in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
“One can only hope that the only good is in it — as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone — people stop ever making this decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London entered a plane towards Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain for the Supreme Court in the event of a victory at Garland as a candidate
Harry Reid, leader of Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garlands confirmation since its nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge in the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference he expected to select Garland, with a certain degree of certainty, from Clinton.
A spokeswoman of Reid later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not cause unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge for the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked the Garlands nomination, being Lakaien and helpers of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also stated that Donald Trump was inappropriate for the Presidential Office.
Treats Wants Neckkalendar for “Women and for Men”
The Treats Magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous nude people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us early this year that his nude magazine was different from Old School Playboys, since “Playboy is for men.”
I do this for women.
He seems to think that it does the calendar as well.
“We have to return to the display of timeless and classic nude, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body,” Shaw said in a press release of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can submit their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community calculated with mass flight
“He who does not adapt and praise Erdogan sits on packed suitcases,” says the Vice President of the Gülen-near Foundation of Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish community of Germany is expected to meet tens of thousands of shelterers who flee from Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the middle of time, it could even become “a hundred thousand,” the associate chairman Ali Toprak believes.
Due to the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
“In the short term, with tens of thousands of medium-term, with several hundred thousand seekers of protection from Turkey in Germany, the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition,” said President Ali Toprak of the “World” on Friday.
Because the government had already covered Kurdish castles with criminal action months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were on the run.
After the exorbitant coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks still come.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
“It can’t be that a state that owns refugees produces refugees in its own country,” Toprak said.
The head of association accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevitian cities.
Thus Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
“They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or displaced in the past hundred years,” said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association called for the federal government to “position as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters”
In Germany, too, a “hexen hunt” against Erdogan critics takes place.
I no longer feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionelles.
The branding as a gülen trailer destroys teachers and other academics' professional existence.
“He who does not adapt and praise Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, by the way, also the Kemalists and secularists,” said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation of Dialogue and Education, the World.
As reported by the newspaper, referring to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks set before the coup the largest group of asylum rights recognized for political persecution in Germany.
On the day of June 30, these were 11,386 people, and thus almost 29 percent of those eligible as asylum rights (39,625).
In this survey, there is no escape from war, poverty or hopelessness.
Asylum rights under the basic law are solely politically, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: \"Then go where it hurts\"
Rare Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals won't get anything from the summer election campaign with - and the holidayers from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the day of the country.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
For blood as so far is not going: summer holidays, heat and country election campaign - it bites.
The locals to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation.
The majority of the vacationers in the country who are on the way to use, rogue or hidden lake are not locals, so don’t choose the country’s day.
Practical problems arise: In the holidays, helpers hanging the posters, blowing up air balloons, distributing flyers, and counting out votes at the end are only effortless.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to let the people pass by the election campaign.
The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.
And it’s also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Selling, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, needs to fear his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now behind the CDU in polls.
It is exciting to see how strong Neuling AfD is cutting off and what remains at the end of coalition stuff.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one can see from its major posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses, and plagues a little with the people, just as his legendary wortkarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, soul ring has got cold feet and gives chancellor Merkel the blame for the AfD’s legacy.
Their refugee policy, their “we create it” has accelerated the rise of legal populists, which is likely to cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU, with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenzo Caffer, has already experienced what it is like to make elections at the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale competitions; Merkel Bundestagswahl is located in the north-east.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony there as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
“There was probably the majority from other federal countries,” said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it also hurts no one from other parts of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the North East CDU largely ignores the usual election standings in marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with sunscreens and air balloons.
That, says Kokert, only plays a \"underorder role\"
The Union has also noticed that it is breaking the ground on the country that it has to put forth great effort to find a wire to people again.
You’re going to be like the left, the SPD, the greens: there’s hardly a place in the country’s wides.
However, the advice of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his opponent is also self-enthusiast: “You have to go where it hurts, where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used.”
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called its SPD for a particularly committed election campaign.
In polls, the social Democrats were behind partner CDU (25) and just barely before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won 35.6% before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are expected to create the leap in the country's day.
They make a modern virtue from the holiday need and leave their election campaign largely on the internet.
\"Online election campaign\" is called the State Chairman Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green election fighters are on track looking for local voting citizens among the holidayers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just curving with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and it is still nice.
Her impression: “Holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are not punishments.”
B27 Renovation: Guesthouses suffer from blocking
At the speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to make.
For those responsible for the construction work, starting at 5.30 a.m. and ending at 20 p.m., there is all praise.
“They’ve all done pretty well,” Elvira Tetzlaff tells us about the jet tank.
This is a super team.
There is no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site could be moved to the south in a plan-made manner, until the end of October.
The agreement will also be awarded to the members responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of auxiliary entrances.
Since the construction site was opened to the south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen and therefore the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation within the site has been relaxed.
The citizens can now go back to the B 27 from Ofterdingen.
The escape traffic through the place seems to go back.
“There have been some significant complaints,” said the deputy chief executive executive, Florian King, responsible for the transportation management of the remediation.
The residents of Bachzatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many tracks sought and trusted their navi rather than the signage.
What led to some trucks being caught in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were also not met, the municipality called for the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.
“There were considerable excesses,” says King, who once learned on-site about the situation.
Two to three have already been flashed per minute.
The fastest was at 77 hours in the Tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site continued, however, it has become quieter.
For the businessmen at B 27 it is only a small comfort that the road is now open to customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don’t like to look into the cards.
But that the B 27 remediation has led to revenue breaks in them, let everyone who asks see through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Anyone who has less to do with the end customer, i.e. for other companies, for which the remediation has little effect.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a “highest slight decline” at Maier car house, but also boasts that of course “the running customer is missing”
The most popular are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formally crown, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to existence.
Not only him, but all the host places have hit it's heart.
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every Euro sales.
The revenue rate is above 50 percent.
The road repair has its operation — for two years — thrown back.
Half of his employees had to get rid of him.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been released, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a question from Göoner about whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the host site would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation at B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the remediation.
Göhner knows from other counties where such a thing has been handled more widely.
For all complaints, Göhner is sure that his host place will continue to exist.
Finally, the family business has been settled here since 1715, referring to the long history.
The fact that other tribal guests now look less often because of the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand.
If you can't go out, it's also nice elsewhere.
That his stem client returns after the end of the repair work, Göoner has no doubt about it.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göoner holds the impact of the B 27 constructions on his customership for the greatest crisis his host has experienced in his long-standing history.
Six months of construction, this is brutal.
On behalf of the terrorist attack, the law is constantly being scrapped.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what does it have to do with terror?
What does the coalition partner say about all of this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation.
All his proposals are “politically justified” to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany in the implementation of his new security package.
They don't challenge anyone.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I also care about it.
However, as the Minister of the Interior, he is in line with results and at a \"responsible consensus\" within the coalition.
De Maizière has spent a little time following the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
However, these are now more extensive.
Some are already known, announced, peaked: that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor does the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law.
The reputation for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities also does not come as a surprise.
In part, De Maizière is launching a second call for proposals that had not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathy for terrorist groups and knock down jihadists with dual citizenship on the German passport.
“These will be difficult points for the SPD,” the CDU man boasts.
He still considers this reasonable and does not demand anything that does not have any chances for the coalition partner.
A few new ideas also present de Maizière.
They have it partly in themselves: it plans fast procedures for abortions and more opportunities for detention of people before abortion.
Refugees who are targeted in the country should have their smartphones checked in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security review.
In the case of allegations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some even worse than so far - for example those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to veil their identity.
Some of these are political and legal.
Some also still work unexplained and leave questions open.
And at some points - in the unfair treatment of patience, for example - the question is: What does this really have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassinations of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about safety in the face of the high number of refugees.
And things that people were deeply concerned about, could not even be knocked out in election times.
Internal security has been tremendously focused.
Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
Uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are elections.
As a result, the Union and SPD are increasingly putting on the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, there was a high gap between the two parties.
First, a war on the facilities of the federal police, then on a security political idea collection of some Union member states, in which the local chiefs also require a Burka ban and a withdrawal from dual citizenship.
De Maizière also strives to make a common tone.
From a departure from the double pass, he doesn't hold anything.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
You're re-opening, don't be meaningful.
And in a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutionally fixed at all corners and whether it is actually “responsible” for the coalition partner, it has to be shown.
There's a lot in it that could cause a dispute.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the issue of internal security.
Party chief Sigmar Gabriel first signals careful talk readiness and says, “The SPD is willing to talk about everything that helps to further increase security.”
Volkswagen is still glimmering.
Despite diesel scandals, delivery numbers worldwide rise.
But not in all markets, it’s around.
In the recall action, there is a word for word.
Volkswagen starts more behaviour in the second half of the year.
Europe’s largest car builder, despite its many brands and some well-running markets, can continue to show up despite the diesel business in the past year.
However, in July, the VW core brand was particularly weakened in Western Europe and therefore again burdened the total sales, as the company noted in the Dax.
In July, the VW brand sold 1.8% less vehicles than in the previous month with 449100 cars.
In Western Europe alone, after China’s second most important market, sales were 14% below the previous month.
In the home market of Germany, the deliveries dropped by almost one-third.
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann returned the weaker figures from July, especially to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, there has been a resurgence of purchase by changing economic infrastructures.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote on exit from the EU has also been charged, a spokeswoman said.
In the U.S., where the exhaust gas business first escalated, there is also a minute to book.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
In total, the mainly affected house mark of the Lower Saxonys continues to shine through the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a delivery rate of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is at stake.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler was able to present a sales increase from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, worldwide 5,904 million.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust gas tests.
In Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million cars to relocate to the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the vehicles are converted, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The autobuilder will issue a “guarantee-like” certificate to the customer after the conversion, but does not speak of a “guarantee” as it was on Friday in corporate circles.
The reason is legal fines.
The “Focus” had reported that Volkswagen had now granted its German customers a guarantee for re-equipped diesel models.
This was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting was being held.
\"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA -
“Avoidable deviations will not be accepted,” Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said.
VW has taken the guarantee that, in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the refurbishment, there are no deteriorations and all type-permission-relevant vehicle values have been excluded.
Volkswagen itself uses the term “guarantie” but not as it was in corporate circles.
In the broad term “guaranty,” Volkswagen sees the possibility of customers coming to a workshop for example half a year after the conversion, for example, with a motor damage, and could return it to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the interest of customers to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the waste gas scandal, as it were, in the event of any possible safeguarding arrangements.
This is why VW does not use the term “guarantie.”
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund at the Tegernsee requires criminal interest from rich savings - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank Chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: “It’s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or Daily Money Accounts.
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it: Normal Savers should not be afraid to pay for their savings gross criminal interest.
Stocks banks pay money overnight at the European Central Bank (EZB), they have to pay their 0.4% penalty interest.
This fee requires the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September by private and corporate customers for depositing over 100,000 euros back to Giro or Daily Money Accounts.
“The first 100,000 euros are free.
“The next 100,000 costs will be 400 euros a year,” Paul said.
He has been guarding 40 million euros for some time, which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he cannot consume.
“They are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs,” the bank chief said.
“I can’t put for every million of the €4,000.
The costs are now in line with the principle of the cause.
The cash simply lies in the treasurers of the Raiffeisenbank, would be far too dangerous: “I’ve already experienced four seizures, I don’t have the fifth yet,” the bank board said.
Most customers had understanding and changed to other forms of investment.
Only a few wandered to other banks.
The Bayern Society declared: “The Committee’s extreme monetary policy rate is causing considerable costs for all banks.
To carry it alone is not possible to “operate economically permanently”
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalty rates for deposits from three million euros, the Thuringian People's and Raiffeisenbank, Altenburger Land, made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, chief executive officer of the Banking Association, said: “We don’t expect private customers to have to pay cover-to-face fees for deposits, so the competition in Germany under banks and savings rates is far too strong.
A banker said there was “a client who is a little more generous with the wealth” at the Tegernsee.
“This can become a problem for a small bank, if you’re protecting free money.
Founded in 1911, the Gmund Society Bank has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region there are well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The Bayern Fellowship Association — since no other banks are currently known to calculate a deposit exchange for deposit by private customers — said spokesperson Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanks (BVR), Uwe Frühlich, declared in late June: \"The threshold of going to the negative towards the private customer is very, very high -
Competition is hard, and it threatens the migration of investors to compete.
Customers in Germany will not be able to do this in the widest possible way.
Destination records: who actually buys sound records?
Single men of middle age love records.
Before you rush to the comment section to pass it on under the pseudonym NotAllSeparate SweaterMittlerenAlters with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the widely discussed resumption of sound records is not on a tree in millennials who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but on midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a plate are very cautious about age between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely purchasing group.
It is also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older plate buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).
But do you agree with the results of YouGov?
If this blog were a news report on television, I would follow the camera while running in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and wildly controlled before I stand, hold my hands, and say something specific like: “So, let’s take a closer look at it.”
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos slows down on its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were established - there is still a handful of fantastic record special shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20) is one day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
“I appreciate it,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These sound records, shown above (he sent me the button by e-mail, I haven't followed him home), dress out the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and re-purchased items he sold when he was young and pleaded.
“Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a little too young to buy them to me,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, adding: “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink very much.
That's my slanderer.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets meet on the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the mediahpe, people who have heard about the comeback and are eager to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I have conducted, people have usually retired around 1998 or 1999 from their collection.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again,” he says.
This would explain the tree to supporters of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound records, from items that wake up happy youth memories.
“I think sometimes it can be filling an empty or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort,” Wez says.
That's for me as a collector, and I think it's so for many people.
It is an easy way to engage spiritually.
“We are like their social workers,” an employee flowed out of a plate stack.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month haven’t heard of it yet.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while browsing through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle-aged men), has noticed a “trophy aspect” of the revival.
“Someone just recently came in and said, “I don’t own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead sound plate so I can put it in the shelf,” he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-heavy, less music-heavy.
We have people who say, “I don’t have a record player.”
These are younger people, not older ones, who are only slowly coming in.
Fopp, who has dedicated the sound records to almost an entire floor, has a beautiful audience when I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and mid-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned businesses - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz dries from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them looks particularly lonely, but nagging mental traumas are difficult to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and is considering the variety of records for sale.
She makes a show window boom rather than a big shopping.
She doesn’t deserve much, so collecting records isn’t a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is... - she's driving off with a loved soap.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I was pretending to pattern the Jeans hotpants, I observed a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a stairway, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - maybe because they're just purely decorative, some so far above that it's impossible to touch them.
It's pure 'plate art'
But considering that each attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send it to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as records.
Even though my research has found that the results of YouGov vote, they, at least in record stores in Soho, leave the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in school or in offices.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday morning with the booming through record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through records, while avoiding the stark look of a mysterious, 30-year-old false Moderator, who is not up above the shoulders of men of middle age.
The Greenlandhai is the longest living vortex - Video report
Scientists say that Greenlandhai has the longest life span of all the vertebrals on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates shark, says that the record was with a female, from which it is said that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French Court rejects offer of abduction of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has refused an offer from the authorities in Calais to downdo dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
During a court trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to tear down 72 provisional stores in which persons within the warehouse offer goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sales, hairdresser services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.
They also led to the fact that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional businesses, but roomed that the concerns of Calais Prefecture were \"absolutely understandable.\"
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who live in extremely precise conditions.
He said the areas offer quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the low noise was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is nonprofitly operated and offers 200 meals per day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaffiliated minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the Kids' cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure “for these children would be a disaster of which the youngest eight years of age”
On Friday, the two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrant estimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp had increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic era, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to be interrupted.
“I continue to keep an eye on the World Cup, remain confident and fight,” wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He doesn’t have a statement for his miserable 12th place in the sugar hat.
“I think it’s really hard to comment on yesterday’s timing,” Martin said.
He had to analyze in silence what reasons had led to the debacle.
At the time of World War II in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
“I’ll look at everything we’ve changed in the last few years,” he said.
“This includes my position,” wrote the three-time world champion, who lost on Wednesday to 54.5 km more than three minutes on Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Swiss).
Olympics: Tennis Profi Siegemund misses semi-finals
Laura Siegemund's victory ended in the quarterfinals of Rio: The world rankings-32. from Metzingen missed a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA no.
34) clearly the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Sieged by back problems, it was only once that it was able to carry out its storage and acted powerlessly in comparison to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, another medal hope for Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance of jumping into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open Winner met with the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas held a medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of summer games had last occurred in 1992.
A German duo has never been in an Olympic single semifinal.
Group increases on start-up for live video game transmissions
To watch other people play video games is a huge trend - of which Microsoft also wants to benefit.
The technology company buys the start-up tree, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is flown for the acquisition, Microsoft didn’t tell on Thursday.
Beam only started his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others when playing, but you can also engage yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and counter enemies as well as provide equipment items.
The Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook will help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The start-up staff, which has been based in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, move to Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and chief Matt Salsamedi announced.
Therefore, nothing should change for the customers by taking over.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by Amazon’s online dealer in 2014 - for almost one billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of the Google Mother Alphabet.
This is where the Enforcement Trailer comes in.
Germany’s Raser needs to rely on the next generation of speed gauges: new flashes are being tested in various federal countries, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, to be able to deliver the pace probes particularly effectively.
For example, the futuristic-acting Enforcement Trailer of the company Vitronic can be used at accident points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limitation there with a stationary flasher.
However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: Its battery will hold five days at an uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data will be transmitted encrypted via a modem.
Laser measuring technology also allows all vehicles to be detected at the same time over several tracks.
Wireless speed limits as well as travel bans after time, rides and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high-speed state, you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with every car with trailer clutch.
In order not to be easily removed, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and, by the way, also fire-proof outer cover.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the lightning from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested and used in various states according to Vitronic.
Foreign authorities also flash with the new technology: Recently France ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
UK gets silver in 7th rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets gold
The impressive performance of the UK at the 7th rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to an cancelled stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit by a 43-7 result at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, backing, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was due to the not too bad comfort prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth that day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in this tournament, where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boxes, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of what happened, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one British tomorrow will have a gold medal hanging around his neck: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former chief for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way behind it.
Eight years ago they lost under Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they just lost one.
This blow is going to hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and allowed the attacks to spread GBs out of fun.
It felt to Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in the busses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau took over in the corner.
With another four minutes playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he converted.
12-0 and GB hardly took the ball.
An elevating branch of Mitchell stopped the mountain from reaching a third gate by husband Leone Nakarawa, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the re-attack and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou performed by further weak branches of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It’s like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning to do so.
It's the same.
GB carried out fundamental changes at halftime and closed the Fivian gap...for the whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova passed through after a brilliant interplay by Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has been in favor of the South Sea Insulers for a long time, whose fans sang, swiveled and danced on the tribune.
It was not hard to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the i-puppet with another try in the last seconds.
The Piff was shown, the Fijis embraced themselves and GB kicked to destruction in the lawns.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a narrow semi-final match from the race - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and reached a gate below the post in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, inspired by fighting with the cancer of the coach for rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that's what it wants to be.
From the first rower strike to the last, 220 hard hits that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there were only the two who sat on the rudder, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the coach Robin Williams, was present when they rowed to the second Olympic gold in two without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports that set such a standard.
Her dominance was absolutely, however, her 39th unbeaten commitment, which is also exemplary.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who slip over the surface with the elegance of weakness, which does not reflect the type of triumph to the full.
Behind every gold in the rudder is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no helper than the coach who didn’t know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, there was a risk.
I had blaze cancer, which is operational and that did it.
If you don't, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It's a little changing the outlook.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he was able to begin his treatment in early 2014, outside the season, which held the interruption to a minimum if, under such circumstances, it is the right term at all.
I needed money, so I had to go better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
The rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of victory, their first thought went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking about it a little more than anything else, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was the chief of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a mission in Afghanistan, said, “I was an emotional wreck this week. This might be something extreme, but it means so much.”
It only repeats how much this means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked together.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks goes to him, and he's the best coach in the world.
I could not have wanted a better person for training or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a loud rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to shut up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped at the moment.
Helen called “continues in the process, remain in the process”
It's really important not to let go.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something great.
We didn’t want to work today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take time for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
That feels so much better,” she said.
For 31 years, it has been exemplary to ensure clarity.
The managing director of the Water Purpose Association \"Veitensteingruppe - Ruppert Göller\" is in retirement.
The association is considered to be a ‘bayern-wide exemplary’
A small brinkish drinking water compound as a model for the large water producers.
Some time ago it was called in the originalton in a contribution of the Bavarian broadcast.
Little later, the water forum of the government of Unterfranken honored the purpose.
The work of the Veitenstein Group considered ‘bayern-wide’ as an exemplary
After all, Rupert Göller, who has been an employee for 31 years, has been serving as managing director for 28 years.
He was retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water group of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrown, promotes approximately 150000 cubic meters of water annually and provides 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
Members are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities, there are water supply contracts.
The current chairman, Breitbrun's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was appointed waterguard in 1985 and has been appointed managing director of the Purpose Association in 1988.
“His tasks have been very diverse, and they have extended from water management construction and maintenance work to office and organization activities, budget creation, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends,” the chairman said.
As an outstanding event, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new well (1994), property purchases in the area of the new well (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high container (1999), the re-creation of a central computer control (2004), and the partial renovations of water lines.
There has been no stopover, and you have always taken up innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio, she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service for 31 years.
He used himself with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own business.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for the reduction of nitrate in front of the district's water forum.
He has received a lot of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, on his part, praised Waterwart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best waiter and he was a faithful man.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As highlights from his point of view, he referred to the well building and the restructure of the purpose association.
The biggest challenge and most difficult use, however, was the breaking of the pipe at the high container at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, it would have to work throughout the night so that the localities could be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrown was also maintained once only because the high container of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who enters the succession of Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: “You must have the courage to talk about it.”
“The medicine has made great progress,” said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was recognized by her son, she believed she had to die.
However, the eight-year-old Tiago has come forward and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
“For example, if I ask him something that is two years back when I sang the Milan Scala, he doesn’t remember anything,” Netrebko said.
He is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebkos connection with the Bassbaritone Erwin scrap.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship status in Bargteheide - Man shoots at life's danger
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at a multifamily house in Bargteheide (Creise Stormarn) on Friday at 10.45 am and fatally injured her.
“The man called himself and told us to have shot his life’s companion,” a police spokesman said.
The murderer is on the run, after which he is publicly caught.
In the meantime, Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, musculoskeletal, brown-burned and has a glazing.
Meanwhile, police have published a photo of him.
But it's a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a glee.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He can still carry the gun with him, the police said.
Those who see Sven S. should call the 110.
Police speak of a “relationship state”
The victim is a year old in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The responsible police in Lübeck initially did not want to make any information about the Tathergang or the relationship between perpetrators and victims; but they confirmed that a human being had been killed.
“It’s a killing crime.
“We don’t say more at the moment,” said a police spokesperson in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special deployment command (SEK) was at the place of action.
Steel - Light view for German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-enhancing German steel industry remains saved from additional costs in millions of heights.
Financial burdens threatened by the sector from the eco-current funding are from the table.
It remained in the liberation of the renewable energy environment at the stock plants for the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the West German General Newspaper (WAZ, Friday edition).
“I’m really glad that after two years we could reach this end of negotiations.
The European Commission had therefore first planned to ask the steel manufacturers, which use gases from the high furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption, to cash.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatens additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works will an EEG envelope of 20 percent.
But they are also not raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on the production of own electricity.
In this way, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined.
Gabriel’s success in the steel industry is of particular importance.
“In view of our campaign ‘Steel is Future’, this is a first step.
\"There is a need to follow further -
“Also, in the reform of the emissions rights trade, climate and employment objectives are weighed down,” said IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacitances and considerable price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation worsened as the world’s largest agricultural country, China, in view of the weakening domestic demand, solidly threw steel on the world market.
European manufacturers are presenting Chinese steel companies with price criteria.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed.
On the one hand, suspended import duties on import steel have been shown to be effective; on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have been brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
At last, prices would have been more stagnant again.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost cuts.
Thyssenkrupp also did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced good six percent less raw steel than in the previous year, as the Steel Economic Association announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the amount produced now went back to the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year’s value.
In the coming months, the association will expect an improvement in demand with an increase in emissions.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing does seniors well
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl, she was in the school choir, in the teaching school she established the art of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
\"Singing moves me - emotional and physical - describes it.
After a sample, she feels balanced, happy and overall more vivid, she says.
In addition, she does something good for her health and her mind.
Singing is a great hobby for seniors right from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, says Hackler.
Through regular co-operation, senior social contacts can be connected and maintained.
Because often social and family structures arise in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: “Acquiring and organizing, relying on others and learning from each other - a choir is a very special form of co-operation.”
Singing can be challenging in a positive sense, says hacker.
Because seniors are training a deep and controlled breathing.
Anyone who regularly demands his lungs does not come out of the pussy even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby.
For older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations the joint singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explained.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Song lyrics and more particularly tunes reveal themselves to the sick of long-awaited events.
When singing, the head is also required a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time to focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.
Even older people who live alone practice not only focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you experience by singing in the choir, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The feeling of self-worth also grows by singing in the choir.
Show yourself: If I practice for a long time for something, I will be better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.
There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who's listening when a sound goes over?
Looking for the appropriate offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the Chores in the area.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church leaders directly.
Many senior churches can also be found on the Internet.
Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help in the Internet search.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - this applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitively than cat on cries of young animals
Biologists have examined in Hannover the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the miauing also did not leave the males cold - but they were always the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can recognize the level of excitement of cat babies at the minions of the little ones.
They respond by ten percent faster to the loudness of cats, which are in great need, as scientists from the Animal Medical University and the Medical University of Hanover (MHH) have found out.
Kater also responds to the calls of cats - but always the same.
“Of course, the acoustic differences between the miauing of less and strongly trained young animals for males are either not noticeable or not of importance,” said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and tones of the cat’s cry differed from the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats were observed from the animal conservation of the MHH.
They were presented for a call from small ones who were taken out of the throwbox for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of stronger straight cats that were also lifted up.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small amounts of data.
“All women, even those who had not yet had their own offspring, responded differently to the cry,” Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker faster when this call was playing the much more straighter cats.
This ability may be innate or develop with the sexual maturity.
“A surprise was that the males responded at all,” the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have examined the reactions of women and men to baby noises several times in human history.
Also, some studies showed that women responded more sensitive to infants, no matter whether they were mothers or not, biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski takes “Gala” to Supercup
Hakan Sükurt is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against the first football star Hakan Sükur.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football game takes place again in Turkey.
Before the duel of the archival rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: \"Business as usual\" is said.
Even when the state of emergency was hanged after the July crash attempt, the government did not affect the everyday life of ordinary citizens.
However, this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup attempt.
There is also no stop in front of football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükürt, the prosecutor issued an arrest warrant.
Thus, the now-inhabitant in America will be accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükürt is intended to be supporters of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the initial state of exception imposed for 90 days is still valid until October, in fact, it has as little effect as it has on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly, democracy guards in public places across the country have declared Erdogan to end on Wednesday.
The sport, like the whole country, is split into supporters and opponents Erdogans.
Especially fans of the Besiktas working club are traditionally not friends of the president.
However, what the growth of Turks is due to dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
There are even fans who agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
At Pokalsieger -Gala - it will be especially re-arriving on Lukas Podolski.
The Cologneer proved its sporting value in the final season: With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first playing time as the top scorer of his club.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1:0 win.
The newspaper \"Fanatics\" cheered him up: \"He was the best in the square\"
He finished the season in an excellent way and assured his team of the Pokal.
Thanks to Poldi, the disappointing season for the record champion found a reasonable conclusion.
After the pre-rounding K.o in the Champions League, the “Löwen” also kicked out early in the Europa League.
In the Süpper Lig it was only six.
The season was not good.
The pokal was the only way to win something.
“We managed and that’s the most important thing,” Podolski said.
For champions Besiktas, the playing year was better.
Thanks in particular to Mario Gomez, who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season matches as Süper-Lig-Torschützenkönig.
This is also why fans hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
At the time, the Gomez, who had been under contract with the AC Florence and had only been loaned to Beiktas, had announced after the coup attempt not to return after his EM permit because of the political situation in the country.
“If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it,” said the specialist magazine, Kicker, club chief Ficret Orman.
However, the stormer had to be willing to reject about a third of his annual salary estimated at €7.5 million, Orman stated: “We cannot pay his salary at Florence.”
Despite doping: These athletes still have medals at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin had already been locked twice because of dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other transferred athletics probes can only laugh about it - they are fighting for medals in Rio.
The theme of doping still determines the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who, after a doping lock, had filed their starting right shortly before the game, was unscathed and excavated at their start (100 metres chest).
It offered a scrupulous scene: With a smile set up, she was still proud in the hall and had provoked her appearance.
When it was determined that she would not get gold, the audience broke into a cheer storm.
But there are many more athletes who, despite doping past at the Olympic Games in Rio, start off.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m staff/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was already locked twice due to dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since its ban, the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex-world champions are even faster than before, it is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the largest challenger in Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m staff/Jamaika): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit down a six-month lock in 2010 after proving the use of the pain agent Oxycodon.
After an operation she had severe tooth pain, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (discuss/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion of 2012, world champion from 2013 to 2016, and European champion from 2010 to 2016, was tested positively for the banned stimulation center of methylhexanamine.
Perkovic objected to the knowledgeable admission and was closed for six months.
The four widest throws this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400m Staff/USA): The Beijing Olympics and two-time World Champions over 400 m, was tested positively in 2010 and closed for 21 months.
A way to increase the penis has been responsible, Merritt said.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Well, hardly any athlete have been able to pay so many medals afterwards.
So Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after being diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to release Olympic silver in 2004 due to steroid dopings and the 2006 EM title due to testosterone abuses.
The also acclaimed bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was returned due to a judgment by the International Sports Court CAS.
At 80.04 m, it is ranked two of the world's rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km of walking, China): The world record teacher and gold favourite was only tested positively in May, but may still start in Rio.
At the 29-year-old world champion, indications of taking a prohibited dietary supplement were found, the lock of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell out mildly and ran off on July 13.
Bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She suffered cut wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but was able to leave it again.
Her home trip was planned for early September.
Whether the further explosions on Phuket holiday island as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, it is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities, says Schnöll.
In about 200 kilometers south of the capital city of Bangkok, Hua Hin was first exploded in a two-bomb area on Thursday evening.
According to police, a Thai citizen was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday, two sets of explosives went up again, and another man was killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the early days.
In the detonation near the beach Patong popular with holidayers, a taxi driver was injured, according to police information.
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country then exploded another bomb that killed an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosives went into the air in a flower beet before the river of the coastal police.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-east coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast called for several injured.
A connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called.
“The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting,” said Army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning in front of journalists.
“We assume that this is a coordinated attack.
It is too early to express itself to possible motives - probably, however, it is about the acts of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombing attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the assassinations were not in connection with the Islamist uprising movement or with international terrorism.
“This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces,” said a spokesperson in Bangkok.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In the past few days, the authorities have received secret information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country, but have not been informed of the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group was behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen safety around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and amusement districts.
There are always smaller bomb attacks in Thailand, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
According to the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends following the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (safety level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After disputes between security forces and Muslim populations, non-necessary travel in these provinces is avoided.
Increased safety risk (safety level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
It also boasts great influence on the military in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to establish chaos while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, which had achieved power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, is itself content to have led the Kingdom to stability and order again.
However, the military has also failed to take control of the insurgency of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people were killed in the conflict.
Just a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the country’s recent history.
The right-wing ‘identitarian movement’ has come into the vision of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several national offices, the constitutional guardians in the federal government also observed the group.
“We see the ‘Identitarian Movement’ points of reference for efforts against the liberal democratic constitution,” said Chief of Constitutional Protection Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith, or of the Middle East, are discriminated in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement as well.
The \"Identitarian Movement\" is a group of French roots that has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes “Multiculti madness” — uncontrolled mass migration — and “the loss of one’s own identity by alienation”
Constituents in nine federal countries - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Niedersachsen, Saxony and Thuringia - already observe the \"identitarians\".
Maaßen said his authority had closely agreed with the national offices in the decision.
“Groups like the ‘identitarian movement’ are trying to pick up their target group where it stands,” said the Chief of Constitutional Protection.
In general, extremists try to address them with a juicy language, often with poppy music.
Islamists do as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not a showy advertisement for your own business.
Propaganda should appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are especially vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
In recent years, there have been reports from several federal countries of contacts from ‘identitarians’ to AfD politicians.
Maassen said he didn't have any knowledge of it.
As regards constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point of view.
It is about whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - will change its target by certain persons who are extremist, and thus become extremist.
Therefore, whether such individuals have a controlling influence on the party is crucial.
This is not obvious.
In view of the significant increase in law-motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees, Maaßen said he would not yet talk about new right terrorism in this context.
But in recent years, we have found that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital Group.
It may very well be that further legal terrorist groups or small groups are forming, planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognized.
The previous groups were formed at the regional level or in social networks.
Concerned, Maaßen expressed concern that many attacks had taken place on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the worrying one.
Many of the suspects in the case of asylum attacks have not previously been known as criminal, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.
“Many people, therefore, have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent, or, for example, elected CDU, SPD or Linke, which then radicalized themselves by right-wing extremist voting.”
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes the internet hot
The Olympics or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the bold appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was not seen in the TV images at the time.
It just disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, Habte became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ended his lead with a return of 48 seconds and occupied the 59th place of 59 starters.
However, it was rather his not just sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian received a special start-up rights from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming known in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethopia, he just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all about: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
Quickly, the first nicknames made the round.
Some media called him the \"robel of the whale\"
In response to a \"well-standing building\" the English boulevard sheet \"The Sun\" with \"Dad Bod\" made fun of him.
His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, there was no role.
Comparisons with “Eric the Eel” were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani took media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to enter a prelude over 100 meters of freestyle alone.
Frenetically, Moussambani was fired at that time.
The 22-year-old learned to swim just eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Trump does not see the impending defeat of the election
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign in Florida.
If it won’t be with the U.S. President’s election, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's going to go on vacation.
Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential elections in November, he would not say: “At last it will either hit, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday,” said Republican candidate in a phone interview with U.S. television station CNBC.
If it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, be it all right, Trump said.
He called U.S. President Barack Obama and Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton as founder of the Islamic State of Terror.
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post is rising in trade with electric transporters
An electric supply vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies at the risk is obviously great.
The post plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
In the near future, the company wants to start trading with the transporter.
The Post will also offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
“We want to go into sales to third parties,” said a post spokesman on Friday.
The company has been checking for months to see if it is going to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered, to other companies as well.
Post CEO Jürgen Gerdes had said that there was always demand, for example from artisans.
According to the news magazine The Mirror, the Bonn Group wants to enter into the mass production of the vehicles in a short time.
In post-owned manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the company wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long run, it will have a complete conversion to the environmentally friendly vehicles.
“We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020,” he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we are changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany’s streets since 2014.
GfK leadership resigns after disappointing business counts
GfK’s consumer research company is replacing its boss, Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK revealed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann is becoming more insecure as long as the successes promised by him remain.
Turbulence at the top of the Nürnberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business numbers and the resignation of company management, the global number five of the industry is facing a new beginning.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert has already resigned from the Supervisory Board by 12 September.
The management in the board took over the previous member of the board of directors Gerhard Hausruckinger on 1 September, the company announced.
He is to officially take over the function of a “professor” until a successor to Hartmann has been found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called “different views” for a long-term business policy orientation.
Details didn't want to be called a company speaker on Friday.
Those who will lead the market research company in the future are still unclear.
In investor circles it was called on Friday that the shareholders were at last disappointed at the continued success of the amendments introduced years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK Spitze since 2011.
“The fruits of the restructuring are not seen even after 5 years,” he said.
In view of the last bad GfK business numbers, each shareholder will be restless at some point.
“If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same,” he said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016.
With EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1% below the level of the comparable year-on-year quarter.
Based on the first half of the year, sales with EUR 721.2 million decreased by 3.4%.
The profit in the second quarter has been especially heavy on the company’s sinking value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company value discounts required in the Consumer Experience business of 139 million Euros were a loss of 148.2 million Euros to the Group under the strike.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had generated another 19.7 million company profits.
Accidents - Bus escapes in crumbs in graves: Eight injured
In the event of an accident of a travel bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhoorn (Aurich County).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to evict their information according to an incoming trucker that was partly on the opposite track.
The bus came right from the street and crashed into a tomb, as a spokesperson for Aurich/Wittmund police reported.
“Because of the bus situation, the people couldn’t leave the bus on their own,” she said.
Firefighters released the inmates.
Six rescue cars and a notoriety car arrived at the accident site on Landesstraße 2.
The undefeated travelers were brought back to the town of Pewsum by a bus.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators urged the slanderer and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The charges per cubic meter of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the wastewater plant Neudorf/Reuth/Weelschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2,10 Euro; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 Euros (up to 2,26 Euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euros (up to 2,18 Euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased again at the latest if necessary improvement measures are necessary.
After an excess calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf is then at €4.37 per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Landratamt Kulmbach, it was found that undercovers for these wastewater facilities are under way.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of legal foundations, to operate the facilities cost-effectively.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.
The cost increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As manager Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the body, a recalculation of the charges for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, there are also over- or undercovers from the preceding calculation period.
The excavating cost increases caused Schmidt to deal with all three wastewater plants with a very low wastewater attack, which was between 6800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros.
In addition, the wastewater rise in all three plants is slightly declining.
Furthermore, in the back-to-back calculation period at all three plants, not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenses, have been affected to a considerable extent.
The facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf wastewater plant due to damage.
In the Welshkenkahl pump plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyors had to be taken over from ground to ground and, after nearly 20 years of operation, had to load out the first clear pond, remove the clear mud, and install an additional ventilation possibility to be able to comply with the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: “For these extraordinary expenses, the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period, were to be considered.
The same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Stonehouses made it clear that, in the low wastewater attack in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance are \"full of impact\"
In this case, Schmidt added that the market community of large entertainment costs at wastewater plants has been spared over the past 20 years.
The situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain predictable in the light of stone houses, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater purpose association cannot be extended to these plants because these are energy-efficient facilities.
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% have been banned.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured after the CPI -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was - 0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month: food and non- alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell on clothing and shoes (2.2%); mobiles, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
The prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; as well as education were excluded.
Snapchat 'Anime' Effect criticised as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.
You can turn into an Ananias, a dog, or a figure that might be painting from a Roy Lichtenstein.
The filters are inexhaustible, property- rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All the errors go to the public.
Snapchat filters have in the past drawn criticism of themselves, in which they were accused that the Blackface app would promote or promote white skin as a beauty ideal.
When some users submitted a filter that gave them slot-eyes, false teeth, and thin cheeks this week, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians — “Yelb Face”
They wondered if this repeated controversy pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and the outrage were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was thought to be a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders, who have experienced Rassissmus, recalled the filter’s hurting clichés.
Others rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely spread over the photos, wrote that the filter was “misleading and likable,” he said.
She added that “it is difficult to argue with the counter-transfer of a very opposed Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the devalued extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross this cultural pride wire.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all keep in hand.
And Snapchat's big audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older opponents - could rather be expecting sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat’s filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, “it’s much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it used to be,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account prompted others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial-related controversy reflects a lack of diversity in attitude practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“In either case, they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions,” said Chinese-American Zhu, “or they have people with other skin colors working there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything against it.”
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently appointed a staff representative who focuses on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said she's going to close her Snapchat account and added, \"I'm wondering if she needs more users like us to be able to say that's not O.K.\"
Military leadership falsified ISIS intelligence information, committee of Congress
Military officials of the United States Central Command modified news service information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than would have allowed the actual conditions on the site, an investigation committee of Congress reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Secret Service Committee and the Armed Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how executives changed their opinions on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state.
The Central Command, short of Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“News service information, typically sent by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were more consistently positive than analysts of other news services,” a newspaper article quoted the report.
\"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders - Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, said.
The leadership errors in Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-sided report shows detailed ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to pressure from their pre-laws, drawing a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts,” the report stated.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military recapture of Mossul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.
“After months of investigation, so much is clear,” said Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the tops of the Central Command changed news service reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force into life after it was played that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation.
In addition, further investigations of Centcom reports by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense are underway.
Democratic members of the News Service Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
“In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly limited process for creating news service estimates on ISIL and Iraqi security services,” the top-ranking Democrat in the Commission, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, \"was delaying the publication of news service reports - harming the morale among analysts and \"giving too little room for differing opinions\"
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there was no evidence of a White House intervention with the Centcom analysts regarding a \"determined political opinion\".
The preliminary results of the Congressional investigation were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported of investigations by the Pentagon's General Inspector, who was admitted after Centcom analysts' complaints.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press spokesman for the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress's reports while the inspector-general's investigations were still underway.
But he also stated that “experts sometimes have very disparaging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense.”
The findings have a negative view of the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).
However, last year’s accusations raised the question as to how much President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic state reminds us of errors over ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a note about how the then government under George W. Bush, opposed to the recommendations of many analysts, had only a small crew of occupations in Iraq, and little time was left to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic state.
Last year, Mr Hooker’s team, according to government agencies, found that, contrary to the government’s statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group’s financial situation, as these provisional refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this discovery was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The United States wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK standing before
One day after shooting three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember ever doing so.
“I don’t know,” she said.
I am not part of the people who keep their gates in memory.
However, she knows: Americans are in the Olympic competition at 4-0 and are equally in their group with the British in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two will win first and second place in their group from six teams.
The first-placed will go out of the way for the strong Dutch women who lead the other group a little longer.
Whatever the game may go out on Saturday, Americans have triggered a surprising turnout through their success story, four years after landing at the last of 12 places in the past London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey striker in her hands for the first time at three years (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16, she became a national player in the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she could not qualify for the frame.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began turning things to the better.
“A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change,” Bam said.
We did not have the work pension in London that we now have.
We have been able to completely tear the rudder.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a back handle from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team suddenly showed up and held the gameplay from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled the ball into the center and emptied into the gate to provide the American with a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the U.S. goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a goal in each of the previous games.
She has a run.
It's just like Bam.
“We are in a good position,” said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
Amid the Rage of Olympic Games, the Zen of Trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inextricably, a fast-paced flow of staff between competition and strive.
It is as if the Olympic fackle itself would be a burning rod, which is ranged from armbrush protection to the swimmer to the triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the waiting snake in the coffee shop, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympic Games for the first time and is a women’s swirl with gruffs, could have been quite among those well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-feeling TV advertising if he were a swimmer, Turner or even fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournament.
The Olympic flame does not light every event the same way.
Further from the center, in part in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, arch shooting, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swim and may rule it for a long time.
But if I might modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, for the last 16 years, it has been so solemnly perceived that many of those I surveyed did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and by 2012 had an athlete who managed to finish it.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain outdoor charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympics.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoon-like citing of its never-to-end blundering - but also the grace of turning and diving, the two sports it essentially combines.
The word “trampoline” comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as “spurboard”
Awning winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost 30 feet into the air and have to get a series of falling movements (threats, heights and saltos) before landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed after execution, difficulty and flight time.
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will attack each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopefuls must go on in their pursuit for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
Not only do they pursue the goal line or the starting wall, but they also have another normal goal in the television broadcast: the world or the Olympic record.
The goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admired, even fanatical - and it is enough to touch even a viewer to tears.
But it’s also what I feel when I watch these games myself as something exhausting.
The trampoline offers a breath break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she is pissed off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly going up again.
There is also a competition here, of course, not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant decline of time and gravity.
It’s just as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be.
Women's qualifications and final rounds will be held on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; those of men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympia mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably overlook in general tumult.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the provision and the objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. tourers recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley is expecting his new fan community to be ringing by air.
\"A Generation Protested\" in Ethiopia, Long an Ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia are at odds with the government's violent resistance.
Witnesses say that ten protesters were killed in gunfire during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia just breaking up?
In the last ten years it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded in more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed onto the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was unmerciful.
Witnesses reported that police officers shot and killed ten unarmed demonstrators.
In circulation, videos about the protests that are likely from the last or beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handhold against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Council is now demanding an adequate investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa’s International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much western help.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new shuttle train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the desert.
But that could change.
“If you’re suppressing people and don’t have any other options except to protest,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protested.
A Generation Protests.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from the use of soil to the use of worms in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.
At the same time, tensions rose along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this bleak, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden’s National Liberation Front, which have been more or less forced in recent years, could exploit and rearm the turbulences.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of squeezing in front of the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and internet services have improved.
Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people are still able to communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they stop.
Several young Ethiopians reportedly gathered for protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since aeons, the Amharas, which come from Ethopien's predominantly Christian highlands, have proliferated in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in rural areas.
But that also changes.
“We are in the process of coordinate under a screen,” said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, who make up about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, had been Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in a non-publicized illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly decorated in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special staff to handle opponents and make them harmless.
“The current regime lacks this basic skill,” said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, were apparently mocked and subsequently stolen by the government.
During the following raids, many protesters were killed, even though they were less than in the last few months and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new shuttle train, as well as for their measureable progress in poverty support.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal malice of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked business run by Tigray, and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the U.S. and other Western allies into a unique position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as the basis for drone flights across neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
“This,” said Mr. Abdi, “is a very thin gratifying migration.
Donald Trump declares Obama's claim has ISIS had been founded \"Sarkasmus\"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to crush the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated allegation, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would not have been the “founder” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication abilities of the Republican presidential candidate as to whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligiblely with the American public.
It also brings his opponents, who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, into the unique position to declare statements he might not have meant.
After making the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rowed back on Thursday with regard to the allegation and insisted in interviews that he really did not mean that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he thought the charge was perfectly serious.
When Conservative radio moder Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.
The last storm of criticism is prying down on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling poll values on the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave talks on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump again tried to return to this issue.
Reportedly, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already brought Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism of himself when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, \"Of course, I mean the sarcasm.\"
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to row back as needed.
“I think it’s one of his methods of testing how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary, ‘explain’ depending on how the reaction happens,’ said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.
However, I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways.
Instead of deploring the tone for presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more delicate tone, as his poll values have declined further.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a major lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocant statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But as he is more focused on the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s jokes have brought his loyal opponents into the uncomfortable situation to stand with him, no matter how provocant his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former New York mayor and one of Trump’s most prominent spokespersons, gave a great deal of effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday.
“I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments,” Mr. Giuliani said, asking Mr. Trump’s statements on whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic state.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back-banglers, perfectly wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread by refusing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania elections on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around on each of his words and taking a stand against him.
He praised the “ Poor, Jämmerliche - TV experts who are trying to understand him and said, “You can’t.”
Some of the Democrats made fun of Mr. Trump’s apology as just another evidence that he was unfit for the Presidential Office.
Once pushed over the price from the market, cafe in Greenpoint comes back
Verb Cafe was a nice café in Williamsburg where you could only pay bar that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, prices from his Bedford Avenue storefront were pushed.
Soap Cherie, which replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a self-Gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, \"I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is out of place and verb is now a soap shop.\"
But if New York is changing, it’s also new.
A revived verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who is the owner and manager of the new café.
He began working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with speck and cheese and there are yarns such as capers and sweetened onions.
There are natural travel committees.
The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for this.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old tribal customers.
“Many old customers were also driven by prices from Williamsburg,” he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after her move to Greenpoint, she would take the way on herself.
After the verb had closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
“I realized that it was in the coffee and culture in the verb that liked me,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been a long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and in no way ordered the same thing.
“I came in the quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss bag watch and they prepared my Everything bag with butter,” he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bag with speck, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no resentment about the soap business taking the old business space.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold brewed coffee of the cafe as a ingredient.
“I think we’re going to go to their offer,” Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he is planning to put it out soon, so his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice site wants to fill and sell the cold-bricked coffee into the bottle.
There is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was tribal and said he was destroyed at the ground when the cafe closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the locality and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
“I had to smell it,” he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in “a rich meal”
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took up his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a fine flavorer, President Roosevelt had a fable for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie grass and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on that day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and as a dessert a plume puddle.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, “It was also a message to Americans how they should eat.”
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book, \"Chop Suey\" was about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman in her book \"97 Orchard\" tells about life in a home on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, “a decent meal” that will appear in the Harper edition on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkelling imbiss in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the 1929 stock exchange crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, served Truthahn with potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion of eating during the Great Depression era.
“A rich food was very popular,” Ziegelman said.
There were peanut bread, liver cheese and beans bread.
They were prepared from a ingredient and something cheap that stretched the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe bordered.
“It must have been in the stomach like lead,” he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked paste for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. A Square Meal records the ways in which the country dealt with it, no longer being the slag country.
“It was a time when food for Americans became a central, tense topic,” Coe said, “and why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Just as exciting was the new budget diet: Secret food such as bread and cash rolls became basic foods, which used cashmeal as a “wonderful way to re-use food,” Ziegelman noted, since cooks could hide unappetite ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry cheese.
Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare served luxury.
Unique mixtures have been tried because a high-calorie and nourishing satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy food understanding.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, brickman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a popular addition to lunch,” Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: “It was surreal.
peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the household business recipes.
As never before or since, household businessmen, including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943, drive the eating habits of the country.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become housekeepers and the challenge of turning Pampe like creamy Spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
\"A Square Meal - is a feast of historic delight bites.
In particular, the reports on the government’s response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s Lass-mich-Küchen-Essen-Haltung, are particularly pleasing.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he ate like the millionaire man of the world to whom he became.
“He liked continental cuisine like fish with Gurken sauce,” Coe said.
He ate in an almost golden dining room and wore a smoking.
He was a wonderful reality stranger.
President Roosevelt may have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to statue an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the renting of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most restlessly prepared.
Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with food, were rejected as soon as the land came back to its feet.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science was applied to food.
The couple indicated when writing the book that the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law were better understood - for example, how she could not throw away food.
“She had a real fear of wasting food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled: “She actually made people sick.
There was the windbag incident.
After the counters were delivered at Eisenberg's, she and Coe made a snack that they had prepared at home: the Pflumendsssssert, President Roosevelt at lunchtime.
“It’s called Prune Whip,” said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a sent name.
There was no beaten sawn, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and zimt.
Each one deliberately entered a spoon into the toe, brown glibs.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe took a look three times.
Like a Can-Do-Budge animal, he said to his wife, “A few billion whales would help.”
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life into play to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others’ lives.
Now, the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that has saved almost 60,000 people from life, according to the picture newspaper.
2900 volunteers put their own lives in jeopardy to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the group's face: A video of the civil protection officer showing him at an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the debris of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol figure in the grey of the war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, according to image, “For me this is the real jihad.”
“When I die to save life, I think that God sees a martyr in me.”
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombing attacks in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia region, one filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from respiratory distress.
“We now remove the toxic remains of the bomb so that not children play with it,” the picture quotes his last words before he dies.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest vertebral animal is almost 400 years old
rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation aboard the Sanna research ship.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks will only grow at 150 years of age.
According to the Greenland Hai, on the ground of the North Atlantic, it is only 1,220 meters away in one hour.
Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a height of 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a robe at this maximum speed.
However, this style of life characterized by long-suffering seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal Science, at least from a Greenlandhai that might be 392 years old.
“Essentially, Alexander Scheuerlein, from the Max-Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, commented on these life span that means a world record for voracious animals.
Although evolution biologists have long suspected Greenland sharks to be stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, and eventually they live mainly in the icebergs off the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measure their time gap when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of the top mountains.
However, preying on this shark: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a robe, another of which had swallowed the jaws of a young ice bear.
Perhaps they are hunting sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice sea and are looking for cadaver that is towering down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now surveyed 28 Greenlandhaie, who caught fishermen from Greenland or Spitzbergen from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters measured.
In order to determine the age of animals, they analyzed the shark's lens core using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is created before the birth of the shark, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Its birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tried to inhale larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons tests at the length of 220 centimetres, so it may have celebrated its 50th birthday during its 2012 investigation.
All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens core, which resulted from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimetres long Greenlandhai showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres may even be 392 years old.
The fact that Greenlandhai females grow only when they are longer than four meters was known.
The researchers were able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold of sex maturity and was determined at the age of 156, Greenland sharks can be found with the increase for at least one and a half centuries.
This is also possible for voracious animals at the moment.
The fact that such methusalme lives mainly in iced waters is not a coincidence.
The record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale with a 120-year-old harpon tip at the neck, was also caught before Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on savings flames.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often very large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal boosts heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than in a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
“A smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible early as possible,” explains the evolution biologist Scheuerlein.
On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.
Building ground in double pack
In the recent session, the Municipal Council has dealt with issues surrounding construction.
With ease, the body adopted the communication from Mayor Robert Putz that “the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin”
After the land, parcelment and development issues were clarified and the applications could be measured, the sale of the estates in the residential areas of the road and the \"Schönau-West\" (Binderstraße area - extension section 1) is no longer in the way of interested persons.
The municipal council is convinced that the construction sites in the rural-marked and quiet residential community of Schönau address young families and decent seniors alike.
As it was said, construction volunteers can report to the town hall immediately, and the granting of the parcels is expected to be advised by the municipal council in its September session.
In order to be able to comply with requests for the establishment of other commercial enterprises, associated with the creation of jobs, the Municipal Council decided to amend the area use plan not created until the spring of this year in part areas.
Thus, the commercial area already designated there is expanded by two parcels towards State Street 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main therefore has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
“It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtänder, head of IW’s financial markets and real estate markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial businesses across the EU.
For the so-called EU Pass, they have so far had access to the UK.
This is using large U.S. banks.
Several banks have already announced moving jobs.
The Lobby Association (Frankfurt Main Finance) calculates 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW spoke on the European Central Bank (EZB), the responsibility for monetary policy and oversight of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Board EIOPA and the Risk Council ESRB.
While the organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less significant for the financial sector than the Committee.
“The proximity to the note bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervisor,” says IW-Professor Voigtänder.
Although Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, it also cuts down on the infrastructure as well as Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Furthermore, the city points with easily available commercial properties.
“In Paris it’s not that easy to find free high-quality offices,” says Voigtänderen.
At the Seine are also the rents for first-class commercial properties by 50 percent higher than the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of company counsellor Mercer, the city is ranked 7th, Luxembourg at number 19, Dublin at number 33 and Paris at 37th place.
Although quality of life is a question of preference: “With its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors,” IW follows.
However, despite Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economic researchers say.
In London, some 144,000 people worked in the banking industry in the end of 2015, and in Frankfurt there were 6,2500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
One U.S. official decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to refund the legal costs you have arising from the Hepatites C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a $200 million damages payment for the violation of two Merck patents, which were in connection with the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge discovered a pattern of misconduct on the part of Merck, including the mineide and other ethnic actions.
When the complaint was filed on Thursday, U.S. official Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to grant the costs incurred during the defence of the case.
Merck tries to match Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck committed suicide and claimed ownership of laboratory work, which is based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead.
U.S.-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from the Islamic state.
U.S.-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city, a spokesperson for the group said on Friday.
The Democratic forces of Syria (DKS) are now entering the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held by the fighters as hostages, Sharfan Darwish told the Reuters associated with the DKS Manbij Military Council.
“The city is now under perfect control, but we are just doing cleaning up,” he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her tax statement for 2015, which resulted in a US$10.75 million income for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband, and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for charity purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly USD5.3 million in Redehonorars; the former foreign minister gave an income of USD3 million from Simon & Schuster’s publishing for her book on her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the presidency, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, released his tax statements over the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
\"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency,\" Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in a statement.
In a sharp contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdrawers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax statements, even though they are not required by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his attorneys have stated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
“They’re on the train,” Clinton’s election campaign assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax checks were completed.
Trump’s critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets, his donations to charity organizations, his business gestures and various other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already collapsed on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday, in which high-ranking Republican Trump urges his tax statement to be published.
On Thursday, she also spoke on the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax statements,” she said.
Politico has reported that during the 1990s Trump paid no or only very little taxes, and an economic journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday who indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign.
Clinton supports an arrangement named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called on Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is here to exchange Trump for a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffett said he had also been subject to a IRS tax audit and Trump has \"angst\" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has released tax statements back to 2007.
On average, the Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
Clinton’s 2015 tax statement showed that it only accounts for USD 100 of its income as a wage, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a cost-effective index fund from which Clinton's dividends and earnings of USD 109,000 taxed.

Condoms with chili powder, firework body promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going into inhabited settlements by humans - they throw condoms on them filled with chili powder.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea of doing so years ago, has, together with U.S. Nature Protection, intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-stage method of protecting their homes and crops without harming animals.
In the past, many spears have used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
“Since we have developed this toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, with a lot more confident that they can stop the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant,” said the managing director of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not scared, a so-called \"Chilli cloud\" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a firework body into a condom, the end of which is turned to the fan.
When it is lit, the condom puts up with a crack and sprays fine dust to chili powder into the air.
A touch is usually already out to chase the elephants.
A last possibility is a thrower who shoots a gold rain fire plant into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimously: No Kioskneubau am St. Goarer Rheinufer
In general, the St. Goarer investment activities of commercial drivers with Kusshand are accepted - but the retail trade in the core city is considered to be clearly sustainable.
However, the request for the new construction of a sales skiosk on the Rheinufer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhinebalcony located in the construction has now been unanimously rejected by the city council.
“In principle, we welcome new business drivers, but at this location in an exposed location on the Rheinufer, this Kiosk does not match,” explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director destroys Berlin hotel because Israeli pre-election has been removed by 'Arabic' request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unraveled a media riot after betraying that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli pre-election, as Arab guests had \"required\" an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary “Shoah” left his anger at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country selection list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel via its own Call Center.
After an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there “shocked him” as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a \"willful decision of the management of Kempinski hotels\"
The reason behind this was even more anger in the director.
“The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be deleted,” Lanzmann’s employee was quoted as saying.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a “great disgrace” reports the South German newspaper.
We were horrified and upset by this event.
That's really embarrassing.
The fact that this has been added to this hotel chain in Germany is even more shameful.
This does not require any explanation.
We expect the hotel to “draw the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the internet, where people called the whole scandal.
Some submitted to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have \"obeyed the alleged calls of Arab guests\"
“Be ashamed,” it said in another post, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, located at the Noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly showed all the accusations of itself and called the incident a “surprise” and “recommenced” at Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
\"There was never a direct instruction - Israel did not include in the quick-election list - the South German newspaper quoted a spokesperson for the Kempinski hotel.
It adds that the country's election has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
Students meet with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday, when they met to protest the government's reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, causing police to use rubber and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their enthusiasm about the plans.
According to the Governor of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw Graffitits spray against provisional President Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after protesters went to the streets in mass to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been deposed by a vote of the Senate to depose her office.
Trade between Russia & Iran is rising to 71% suddenly - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent in the year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, interest in Russian companies has increased greatly in business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies establish existing connections with Iran, while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade sales between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran rose by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
For this year, Dzhagaryan is starting from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, Russian foreign representation issued about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries, with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes it will change.
“I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition,” he said.
Witness search: Drinking market in Waldbröl
A robbery has been committed on Thursday evening on the drink market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
In the presence of a gunman, three dark-dressed persons who had mutilated their faces demanded the release of cash from the beverage market and then fled on foot and then probably with a silver-colored VW Gulf.
How much money has been spent, police don't tell.
The perpetrators should have been between 1,60 and 1,70 meters tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the park deck of the Rewe market and poorly accessible.
The perpetrators must run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg after the incident and be flown by the silver-colored car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladerring).
Those who have made observations at the time (at 19:45 p.m.) that are in connection with the robbery should report to the police urgently.
Nagold: Play and fun at summer leisure
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and adolescents of the social education group/social group work of the Children's Protection Federation Nagold with their caregivers at their summer leisure time in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet leisure home of Hardtwoldle, the life-satisfied group was quartered during the first school holiday week.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
On the one hand, it went to boards with the visit of the striker zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special child guidance in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip took us to Pforzheim.
At the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and the food of the Kelten.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep lake in Maulbron, which invited for jumping, swimming and planning.
Culinary children and caregivers were spoiled with their self-prepared body food, such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Sea Source Pändle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English-Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognase.
In workshops it was bagged, beautiful jewelry pieces made of pearls and stones or made from wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire, and the final “Bunting evening”
On the day of the home trip, the sun laughed and the children and youths returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the gate of mercy
The Ministrants from the soul care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were handled together.
In order to bridge the time up to the next Romwall trip of all the Ministrants in expected two years, the Upper Ministrant round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various tourist destinations were reviewed, and it was eventually decided for the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the gate of mercy opened to this end at the Freiburg Münster.
16 minis from bitterbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Holy Chambers went on their way.
In the evening before, parish priest Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessing the pilgrim crosses and giving the pilgrims their eyes.
From Horb, a train was taken to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a mouthpiece of Our Lady of Love, and thus the pilgrimage was reached by the Münster.
The individual daily tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way, the minis on field crosses, chapels or churches were always rushing to sing together a song of their own piece of pilgrim song lift.
For the overnight stays, parish houses of the local parish were available.
At the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
Further on the second day, Furtwangen went to Goedzenbach.
On that day, the step to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous road route, had to go down about 500 feet [500 m] in the case of sweater heat and then get up again.
The earned reward was a common grill at the bathroom in the evening.
After the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrim day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went on the final stage to Freiburg.
Visually easy and happy, the minis arrived at the Munich city in the afternoon and entered the gate of mercy in the afternoon.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage by co-operator Markus Obert.
After worship, the pilgrims were able to visit the shrine and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon it went back by train to Horb.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.
Scotland Callum Skinner storms home when British gold is given for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner rushed to fame last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrome in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had taken on himself. The boy’s donation made the legend proud when he stormed home to host a victory from New Zealand’s favorites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place at the London Railway World Championships in March despite Hoys’ resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a hint.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to close.
Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the shot that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was barely back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation where Hinds moved in a higher direction to slow him down and allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy looked forward to his position as a BBC expert and fell to Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they rose to the podium.
The 23-year-old Glasgow Skinner said: “It’s a smoldering comparison.
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set up an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hinds admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, “It feels like it’s with the entire GB flags on the tribune like London.”
We have come together as a team in the last three months.
We've gone so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the form Kennys, it is possible that he will repeat Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a apparently sacred date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's what happened to Hoy.
Kenny next participates in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I just enjoy this for the moment.”
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, “If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight.”
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-mile race.
They arrived at the goal at 3:51,942.
The world record that won gold in 2012 was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the contestant, where Wiggins will be in the focus of safety.
He had fought with officers yesterday before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time at 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong rail bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a scar of medals.
After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were dropped.
It played dramas in the background, said the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mobbing allegations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of the melting of Portland on account of the reduction of the energy contract is questionable
The future of Portland's aluminum melt in Victoria, as well as hundreds of laborers' jobs, is at stake, as the plant operator terminates the Energy Supplier Agreement and will therefore terminate all delivery contracts as the energy company announced.
This step was followed by the decision of the Government in Victoria in the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A 20-year-old grant is due in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs — both direct and indirect — could be at risk of closing.
In addition, it could result in domino effects, as the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of the entire Victoria's electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa’s melting plant in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
“AGL assumes that the facility in Portland will continue to operate, which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting industry,” the company said.
AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called “refunding transactions” that should have entered into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will end in 2017.
“As a result, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue,” the electricity supplier said.
All potential effects on revenue on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecast of the strong date markets for wholesale power prices.
AGL announced that it has already written down the value of the contracts in its annual conclusion of $187 million in “exploration of termination.”
Alcoa said that the decision to buy out the contracts, to operate the “Faith of Alcoas... the meltrry or to ensure the power supply to the meltr” did not interfere.
The U.S. company said it has concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that would have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of explaining why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
Regarding the statements of analysts early in the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [stream market].
And for us as electricity producers, that would not be good,” he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the year-rounded September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, who is brand ambassador to Estee Lauder and ran on Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
“In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to wine,” Kendall wrote.
The revelation of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of troubles Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgets the cover of her sister and ends up with a classic twist: they have all planned a surprise party.
This is the cliché action of almost every birthday episode of a child’s broadcast (Seacrest brought the phrase, “You thought we forgot you?,” with the honesty of a cartoon canine on a broadcast site at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall’s big sister Kim may have hit her as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were watching it in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine’s September issue is a league for themselves.
The September issue is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.
With a range that resembles an image tape rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were advertising from the 832 pages of the whaling 615 pages).
The revelation of his cover star is so keenly expected that in the last two years, images of the magazine have been scourged even before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more “famouss” that are models than “models that are celebrities” on the cover.
Oscar award winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even at the low chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the \"breakout model - her generation - falls under the previous category, is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars of today who know how to play a good Snapchat video (even if all of them apply to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success does not like everyone.
With their reality TV history, Jenner’s position in the fashion world was always exciting.
In June, the former Victoria's secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called her \"the missing pieces of the moment\".
These feelings cooked up again when the message with the appearance of Jenners came out on the Vogue cover.
But on the wrong side, it seems to go past the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
It is in the truest sense of the word a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective PayPal apps.
She sells images of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her leisure, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Each year, 160,000 people are denied access to Community law centers
More than 160,000 of the country's most need for aid are rejected annually by the Community law centres, while the industry is focused on the impact of further medium-term cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly elderly people, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence, and those who have no means of unjust deliberations and similar — are denied their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already overburdened, are ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the public law centres of Queensland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Rights Centers found that thousands of people are already being rejected every year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a reduction in the federal decision.
“Queensland’s community law centers are chronically underfinanced, which means thousands of people are denied important services you need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unsurprising and extortioning debt, families who go through separation, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent, which means that thousands of more helpless people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any assistance.
We urge the Attorney-General and Federal Justice Minister and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to immediately lift these midterm cuts so that people can receive the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centers and their customer communities and to invest the government of Palaszczuk in this important work.
Donald Trump indicted election campaign after employees allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of alleged inactivity after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a gun at an employee in February while they were on their way in a jeep.
The incident is described in an indictment filed by Vincent Bordini on Wednesday in the Charlotte National Court, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini stated for months that the matter would be regulated internally internally before he realized that - that would not happen -
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, - pulled a gun, placed his right-hand finger on the pulloff, and rammed the run in Vincent's Kniekehle - stated Bordini in his charge.
After complaining to local and regional campaign management, Bordin noted that at least four more people had already made the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
\"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage,\" Bordin said.
The charge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the \"Second Amendment people - gun owners and gunmen - should take measures if his rival Hillary Clinton is to be elected and appoint judge.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not be in charge of violence.
Bordin's complaint requires damages from the campaign for the violation of the care obligation and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent psychological damage.
Trump's press spokesperson Hope Hicks was unable to reach for an opinion.
Try to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign employee.
Calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, have not been answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The proceedings is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: SPD and CDU lose survey in front of country elections
In the upcoming elections in the German states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) there are significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys from the opinion research institute INSA for the \"Picture - Zeitung (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could hardly continue to rule, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance to continue to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD dropped from 35.6% five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party is only barely ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left came to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would represent 19 percent for the first time in the country's day.
In spite of slight losses, the greens return to the Schweriner Landtag with 6 percent (presumably 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not represent 3 percent in each country day.
In the Berlin election, the SPD of the survey was only 23 percent (Election 2011: 28.3%).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It still lies behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented for the first time in the House of Representatives by 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, the pirates would, on the other hand, miss the entry unlike 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
Email and Internet in Zeitlupe: 20 years ago, Nokia communicator came to the market.
The followers dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn’t good in hand either.
On the contrary, it was quite clever.
The built-in memory initially consisted of eight megabytes, which would be rich for about two selfies with high resolution today.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The “Nokia 9000 communicator” came into business on August 15, 1996, exactly 20 years ago, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they are somehow from the stone age of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as a “office in the West Bag format”.
In fact, the new mobile could be a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator to reach.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit painfully slow.
A pocket computer was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the cell phone could be folded up similar to a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black and white screen were found.
Very proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euros.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could have imagined in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has changed.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The cell phone section of the findings experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold and processed to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere be online, this is for many people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Some 1.4 billion devices have been sold, and Samsung and Apple alone have 555 million pieces.
Global sales with the devices amount to around 400 billion euros.
This includes the well-running shops of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
Around the smartphone, a whole industry has been created.
The crucial breakthrough to the mass market only came in early 2007, when Apple chief Steve Jobs on the Mac-World announced the introduction of the iPhone.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, all by touch screen easy to use.
Apple’s victory track started, yet today the iPhone is the main product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola, and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had a look.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and Asian providers like Samsung are now saying this.
The smartphone is a naturality 20 years after its invention.
Today, every German looks at his cell phone 88 times a day.
“We all have to learn to put the smartphone away,” said Janina Ball, in the Siemens Board of Staff.
Permanent reachability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewed and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrows, as was in London in 2012, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympiad brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local and local companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new schools, create 40,000 new jobs, and end youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they had predicted in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrows is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame ourselves on the world stage.
The twins were wrong in 2012 and they will also lie wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Extension is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in scientific growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, who has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - which has been selected for five years as the world's best airport terminal, up to the T2 built in the middle of the two most frequent running stages in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investments.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as ensure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the \"Katz and Mouse Game - About Advertising Blocking
For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to handle ad blocking, a “katz and mouse game” are the same.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post stating that users could update their filters in the program to reblock advertising on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding with regard to its advertising ads to make it difficult to detect the detection of which part of the page advertising is.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams spokesperson wrote that “this kind of back and forth fight between the ad-blocking open source community and the transducer has been under way since the invention of ad blockers,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has been involved in the struggle is a strong indicator of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use ad blockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company has set it aside on ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large share of revenue, so Facebook appears to invest in such a step as worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its “talk preferences tool” to have more control over people’s targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
“For the users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem,” a Facebook spokesperson told them in an e-mail message.
Advertising blockers are a stupid means, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control into people’s hands.
Women who are likely to commit suicide on the Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police call for witnesses after a woman was overrun by several vehicles on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday.
The incident took place on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Waadt shortly after midnight.
In the dark, in an act of despair, a woman lay on the street and was hit by several cars, police said.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 wanted to kill herself by several vehicles, including a truck.
She still died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been reported, but some have still not been identified, the police who are asking these and any witnesses of the incident to report to themselves.
An investigation procedure was opened, which is a logical step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be expected whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
That’s something the prosecutor has to decide,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers are not held responsible.
In each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the motorists did not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway, as it was called in the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was released from the fatal killing after she crossed and killed a man who lay on the A1 in August 2014 near Payerne.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, according to the court.
The court found that the police officer -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a \"perfect extraordinary and unpredictable situation,\" the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once habitable
Venus, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, was probably once inhabited.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to discover Venus’s past using tools and algorithms similar to climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could once have had earth-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere.
Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and was still slowly turning.
The model also highlighted the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variables to house life and protected it from faster thinning.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
“In the GISS model simulation, Venus’s slow rotation exhibits its daily side of the sun for almost two months,” said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a rain screen to shield the surface from a large portion of the sun’s heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once probably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans were diluted and their water vapor was burned away from the ultraviolet light.
When her hydrogen was decommissioned, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained back — the Venus that we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations from Colorado Avalanche and introduced a very low right of association in the decision-making process of the team.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorado's Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will be looking for a new coach immediately.
“In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
I thought long and a lot about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth, it needs it and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the coach’s vision and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with the organization.
He must also have a right of consultation in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick informed me today of this decision,” said Sakic.
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was awarded the best coach in the league during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 as winner of the Jack Adams Award.
He led the club on 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota's playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the two last years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second Wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume conversations, strike out
The labour battles with regard to the payment for North Sea oil workers will be suspended, while all the fighting parties are on the table for a new round of talks, Negotiators said.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute,” it said in a joint statement.
We will hold some full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will start early next year to re-apply to the problems.
The unions said their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure this year.
The company’s rate reduction follows a 10-percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional shortenings give the company the space needed to get through the market decline.
Shell, for his part, has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it rationalizes its operations as a result of its mega-coupling with the UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that was strengthened by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with workers at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have been taking place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for few,” he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending on new North Sea projects is expected compared to an average of around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the Plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of rotational rates among the stars of the star-hop of the Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the starry sky rotate at different rates and in what context are the rotation periods associated with the planet's emergence.
“We hope we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system by comparing our results with other stars,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech’s Infrastructure Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light-years away from the earth.
Many stars in this star cluster, which originated about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these ripening stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of an identified star spot -- such as sunspots --.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dances, with larger stars turning slower pyroutets than smaller ones.
“In the ‘Ballet’ the Pleiades, we see slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars,” Rebull said.
Since the starship of the Plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.
“The starship of the Plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older,” Rebull said.
There’s much more to learn about how the how, when and why stars slow down their rotational rates and so on, hang their dance shoes.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotational rates of the Plejads, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US Baseball Star in best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays will last wear the jersey of his New York Yankees.
“I love this game and this team.
“I say ‘Goodbye’ to both,” said the 14-year-old All-Star Game Player of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was selected as the most valuable player in the league three times, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract gave him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will serve as a consultant and youth coach at full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid back for a long time with performance.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams — Runs — for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 he has created some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have the most important statistics of similar values.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the fame hall of baseball.
Because Rodriguez - nicknamed “A-Rod” - was so successful on the field, his appearance is controversial outside the square.
As early as 2009, the superstar admitted to \"ESPN\" to have taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was shut down for 211 matches due to a involvement in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received powerful funding for years via an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the lock was reduced to 162 encounters.
“The league might even have done me a favor for 2014 because I’ve played for 20 years without a break,” Rodriguez said.
Also, his farewell days are not noiseless.
While many baseball legends once again receive the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
“My job doesn’t include a farewell tour.
“My job involves trying to win every game,” said Yankees coach Joe Girardi.
At the same time, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and was followed by the relationship with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from fans from Yankee arch rival Boston Red Sox.
“We because A-Rod - the supporters sang at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silvia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Note: Due to a positive doping sample, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overrated by the first official doping cases.
An avid athlete had almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the match, the first official doping cases became known as the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter hiper runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested and excluded in Brazil, right before the start of the already critically-acquired athletic competitions, these news come to an end.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was proven last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butterfly, and only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the front steps over 50 m freestyle.
Chen has invited the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B-Probe and a hearing.
The national association took the matter very seriously and demanded full cooperation from Chen in the investigation, Xinhua quoted from a statement: “We will work with the International Sport Court of CAS and will accept the ruling.
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanctionation of athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the message about the positive sample at Danekowa went through, and the 33-year-old went into the offensive himself.
“I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive — this was an incredible shock — she told the Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, “the only explanation could be dietary supplements,” explained the athlete.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-Probe should also have been positive.
Bulgaria’s Prime Minister, Bojko Borissov, immediately reported on criticism of the athlete.
“I don’t understand why the athletes don’t draw the right conclusions,” he said, “we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded.
For example, all weightlifters from the chronic doping-laden nation must not participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case “Adrian Zielinski” was also known, the London Olympicser in class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days earlier positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolone.
Both object to the intake, but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg.
Before starting the lightweight athletes, especially the Danekowa case is another severe blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Association of IAAF had refused to launch the entire Russian team until an exception due to systematic dopings, and the runnership of Kenya also produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the past offenses in China also caused fierce disputes between athletes.
In this way, the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympics Sun Yang Harsch.
Sun Yang pinkelt purple
“When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender,” Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the center of a dispute with Australian Mack Horton.
“I have no time and no respect for doping frauds,” he said.
In 2014, Sun was tested in a positive way at the Chinese Championships for the Stumpan's Trimetazidin, but only a three-month lock.
Data Claw: As perfide, hackers extort their ransom money
Programmers of extortion malware are currently attacking targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists among 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed in the past 12 months have been at least once, partially multiple victims of an attack with extortioner software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have once been target of ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms required by the perpetrators in order to be able to re-use the attacked systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize in their extremator software, according to the observations of malwarebytes, looking at attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially extorting ransom money is far higher than in private users.
“We are currently observing a frightening fast evolution of the malicious software,” explains malware byte chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the “world”
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks occurred quickly in the past few months.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: Once active on a victim’s computer, it searches for recently modified files such as word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encode the ransomware and delete the original permanently.
The software then presents the requirements of the oppressors.
To get the final encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money — mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where in private users the personal photo database is at stake, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.
Therefore, the damage will be higher if a ransomware is charged.
22% of affected German companies reported loss of sales by ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt business activities completely, in one case, people were in danger of living.
In Germany, multiple hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of sick acts.
“We always say to the victims: Don’t pay, you only promote the problem,” Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in operation.
The hackers know this again and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-secure security researchers examined the user surfaces and contact with the oppressors and came to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims how to pay via Bitcoin by chat, use free access support websites, or unencrypt example files.
And after payments of a few hundred euros, private people will have to deal with companies in part and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sophos explains: “A single person can write a ransomware about a week,” he said.
However, it’s more likely that it’s three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software building box to the actual oppressors.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
“In the range of delivery, there is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed,” Wisniewski says.
The oppressors then seek out other hackers to distribute the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log in to one of the forums below, buy the set from a criminal and assign another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
“Obviously, the criminals then order spammers with the spread,” Wisniewski explains.
Ransomware’s risk is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of company IT managers in the malware byte survey rely on the ability to defend ransomware through file backups and scanner software.
As a result, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
“If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful destruction, the perpetrators will instead threaten to publish sensitive data, such as customer lists or price calculations,” explains malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, the risk of damage depending on the type of data is still a lot higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take completely new goals on the Internet of things on the grain.
At the Hacker Conference, Defcon demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom.
If the perpetrators then instead of the heating in the future block a whole manufacturing road in a factory, ransomware could also become a topic in the industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and daily
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatileness of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves itself to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is more small, passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the foundation, it does not work closely in any place.
The materials of the interior are well-processed and work pleasantly, only the cockpit top falls off there.
More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage room.
Not only is there a case space of 453 l for raised and 1026 l for folded backrests, but there are the \"Magic Seats\"
This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like cinema chair and thus provide storage space, which is 1,24 m high from the ground to the ceiling.
The suitcase space can be loaded well, but the load height is 650 mm slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he may have done his job a little more slowly.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasant.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l-benziner with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
However, the steering may be a little more direct.
The equipment does not open any wishes in the tested top variant “Executive”.
The security systems include the City emergency brake assistant (worked to pace 32), the collision warning system and the track stop assistant.
The collision alert sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles as “alongside objects” when ranking.
The remote lighting assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent pace controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and, if necessary, droops the speed.
However, the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI bushes are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat difficult to reach.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoliner from €20,000, the diesel from €23000.
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable for: crash on air-gas bridge
An airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because liability is only possible in the event of dangers typical of air traffic, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The complainer had broken a knee disc at the crash.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay the man any compensation.
Disease case: When does the organizer pay
Illicit holidayers will only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found at the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than 10 percent of guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family on the second day of their Turkish vacation was seriously ill with outbreaks and outbreaks.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their disease led the holidayers back to a defective clearing plant, which allegedly had polluted the seawater.
The family thought the trip had been inadequate, and complained against the organizer.
In court, the prosecutors had no success.
Even though the cleaning system was actually defective.
However, the organizer only learned about it shortly before the claimant left.
So far, he had to assume that the sea water was okay.
So he did not violate his information obligations, the judgment said.
No contamination was found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection among themselves - is at the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were sick.
De Maizière said that according to the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state had to be singled out and at the same time decided to respond to terrorist threats.
Our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals have to leave the country more quickly, however, this increases security and strengthens the population’s approval for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve an implementation of the proposals until the 2017 federal election.
He also announced another personal strengthening of the security forces, namely, in a mid-four-digit order over several years.
Sympathy advertising for terrorism has to be punished again.
Video surveillance is designed to improve the right to arms so novel that it is especially difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
The last much discussed silence for doctors is to be kept according to de Maizière's words.
However, in the dialogue with the doctorate, he wants to look for solutions to how the threat of citizens can be reduced, he said, with a view to mental complications.
In order to counter radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers better social care necessary.
Teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
To pursue criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use covert investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said, “The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase safety.”
It is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly opposes actionism.
“This was an ear-feige for the scariers in the CDU/CSU,” Gabriel told the radio media group’s newspapers (Friday).
De Maizière had rejected calls from the Union following a Burka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship before.
A general ban on full wear is considered constitutionally problematic.
You can’t ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You can talk about rules such as road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green Chief Simone Peter accused the minister of always being able to simulate action and action with new anti-terror packages.
Left-party chief Bernd Riexinger said: “Flooded proverbs and a sharpening of the right of residence no longer bring security to the people in this country.
Better traffic flow on the highway
It is regularly on the reverse road - here is a picture of November.
But this should change: the rule of law is to be extended.
This is a good news for all the car drivers who are in professional traffic on the surrounding street every evening when they drive over the highway (A 43).
The Weseler Straße will extend the right-wing trail by 700 meters on the road between Hammer Straße and Weseler Straße on the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and Weseler Straße.
Drivers can then enter directly from the Hammer Road on the right.
The big advantage: the traffic divides at an early stage, thus improving the overall flow on the much-used section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU fraction in the district representing Münster-West.
The driving system on the supplyer is particularly nervous to motorists between 17 and 19 o’clock.
On the day of work, the back stick extends to the bridge beyond the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle tube on the B 51 just before the Weseler Straße departure.
From here traffic is directed only one-way across the highway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt three and a half years ago.
The reason: static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary carrying force to take up the heavy load traffic two-way.
How long this Engpass and the associated working-day stand will continue will not be able to say the competent land operation.
However, with years to come: because the bridge has an official resumption period until the year 2034.
For the extension of the law enforcement system, the country company has deliberately chosen the less traffic time in the school holidays because of disabilities to be expected.
Transport will be carried along on Tuesday and Wednesday by one-way at the construction site.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the Waldschule visited the play “The Invisible House”
The Nima's Association and the Young Theater are now planning a music project.
The Nima's Association allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The \"Class International - the Waldschule Kinderhaus\" has visited an idea of the award-winning piece - The Invisible House - of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the “Intercultural Travel” initiated by Nima’s Association, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 visited the scene in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the class youths came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016, and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scene pictures and video animations, they have been able to follow the course of action anyway, according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Bärtel, and the Young Theater will work together in the coming playing time as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without an escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years of age should be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in planning.
The “Intercultural Travel” project continues.
In view of the increase in refugee numbers, the association expects many classes who want to participate.
Rain instead of star snoops: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has taken into account the star snuff guckers in the south-east of Germany on the night of Friday, but there is still hope.
The night has been bad because of clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle, said the chairman of Welzheim Starwarte, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night to Saturday.
The weather should be good, then we will see a lot of stars in the sky.
The starships are perseids, which are among the fastest starships with 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the north-east.
Restful night: Tips against sleep disorders
In the evening you will always be wandering around, at night you will be awake for hours, and in the morning you will no longer be thinking of sleep long before the wake-up bell.
This is all but restful.
At the same time, you are dealing with such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep is frequent or permanent than non-restorative.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be a variety of causes for them, Hans-Günter Weß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine, emphasises.
What you understand nationwide below, however, is the insomnia, that is, a sleep disorder.
Just sleeping through feels a lot of people are unsatisfied or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member in the German House Medical Association with practice in the Dutch Varel.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
There may be organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also medications.
Not rare is the sleep disorder expression of another disease.
“Very early wake-up is especially common in a depression,” says Weess.
And it may be that different factors require each other.
For example, if you have a tape disc incident, you can lie bad, wake up every two to three hours, and start to grumble about everyday problems and concerns, we will give you an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
If over a period of one month in at least three nights per week is not sleeping well and affected by the day, then go to the doctor, White advises.
The impairment may look quite different: you are beaten, tired, unsleeping, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.
In order to relieve sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include changes in behavior, cognitive behavioral therapy, or also medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in question.
Low-lying sleep physicians are rare in Germany, emphasising Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medical Center of Charité University Medicine Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems, you should first turn to the doctor, advise Weess.
He can explain with research whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep laboratory, and what happens there?
For example, for research in the sleep laboratory, physicians recommend that in the case of snorkeling with respiratory disorders, in the case of ill-tempered day-to-day fatigue, in sleep transducers, or if you don’t find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
In fact, you don’t have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
“Just don’t make lunch sleep,” says Fietze.
After the cable you go to bed at its normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears a nose glasses, a chest belt and a feeler on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleep end.
How can those affected get into trouble?
There are quite a lot of set screwes that you can use for a better sleep.
We know that there are regular sleep and wake-up times, not too long in bed, not sleep on the day, not television to sleep, avoid alcohol and not watch the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that is absolutely not.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has voiced on Facebook for the disappointing cut-off of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the Shortway World Championships in Doha and also set his first world record.
Now the former DSV Athlet Markus Deibler has placed himself on Facebook protecting himself from his ex-team colleagues who are critical.
“In a country where an Olympian receives 20,000€ prize and a Dungeon’s 150,000€ no one should wonder about missing medals — the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The support system in swimming sports is bad, however, the doping controls are very good.
This will not allow us to compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look at or even do it in the subject of doping.
“I’m not saying that the controls should be set here,” he continued.
If he wanted to launch a comeback, Deibler had to be notified nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency of Germany (NADA).
It should be the same with countries.
“He who cannot be controlled a certain time before WM/OS by independent controls of WADA/FINA should not be allowed to participate,” calls the President-Hamburger, who now operates an ice-collar.
Airport: Bands of Baggage Thief arrested
Professional theft at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, citizens of the Düsseldorf Police arrived at the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61.
As a band, the suspects had made several pocket and luggage thefts.
At 21:30 a.m., civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July this year and had been in the community, working part-time and particularly professional.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissioner 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had personally been sent to Germany to commit crimes.
They had totaled more than 15,000 euros.
Altbauten, a few Linden trees, between the rest of the headstone: The Rigar Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work at first glance, but the police are one of the “dangerous places” of the city.
If you walk the road from east to west, you pass to playgrounds, a fresh-stripped kindergarten and a biocharge.
At the façade of a grey house, someone \"hateful\" has sprayed.
In contrast to a Lidl, which will soon be torn down, it is already being built: By 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
Articles about this “twenty-five” district, as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, are, however, preferred to be depicted with burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason is the house with number 94: Once it was occupied, now the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, Berlin’s interior senator Henkel has repeatedly expressed concern for a hard operation of the police against the project, calling the area “No-Go-Zone” for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, patrolled official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on the site, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown homeowners, construction workers renovated the rooms.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the premises had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the cheer of sympathisers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the road will work peacefully: parents will walk with children, people will sit on the borough in front of the houses in the sun, others will entertain themselves in the form of rugs.
A primary school and kindergarten are located in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiesz since 1999, and Jana*, who raised three children here, are particularly nervous about the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a choice that mostly sought police protection from looting links.
The grave, which the Berlin Interior Senator and the police open between homeowners and their neighbors, obviously does not exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working district, which today also has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the residential projects born there have long been among the first: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Street near the Rigar.
While the mainzers were issued under great police orders in a regular street battle, many of the projects in the Rigar were legalized and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the city has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world: with them, residents from DDR times and former homeowners share their choice.
This can also be noted in the rentals that have increased by almost 60 percent in new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigar are used as symbols for this development: they are recognized by thrown-in disks or newly dashed façades that have been entrusted with colour bags.
No other street has been mentioned this year so often along with the words “left-autonomous violence”.
One reason that not all neighbors view this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury are reportedly almost exclusively against police officers.
Most of the crimes involve damage to property, which tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no reason for uncertainty.
With regard to violence, she is critical: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who were not determined to do so.
Also, the famous burning cars no longer exist directly in the Rigar.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: “Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than anywhere else.”
New builder has deliberately moved into Rigar Straße - and remained.
That is why it was so important for the residents to get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the height of interpretation over the part of the city in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road will continue to take them away: by means of faceless new buildings in former buildings that put the old inhabitants to death.
“These are ultimately property apartments that are not interesting to many here, here are more people who are not so well-informed,” she says.
“I can’t say goodbye to violence and destruction,” he said.
But what should you do if someone never listens?
There is frustration on all sides, including police and residents.
For those who are upset with color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene were part of the choice.
Those who move out should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a knife district who can complain badly about noise there.
All first-named people have asked not to be called by their proper name.
Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the employee in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on site.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social educator supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as an employee for all the participants: refugees, the working circle of refugees aid, administration, authorities and anyone else.
Regine’s customer from the workplace suggests that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the ovary wool milksau, which has a problem above all.
In this way, some — less mocking than others aimed at the multitude of desired areas of work — would have meant that the administration wanted to write out the office.
An administrative force was sought with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, an ovary wool milksau.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has a 50 percent stake in three years.
“It was the highest time,” says Regine Customer, who supports Annika Deuschle’s honorary and chief players.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers are standing in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been the finding of apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized for some time.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
You have to accommodate the refugees in your own or rented living rooms.
The cost of building, renting or renovating these properties must bear the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility varies from the county council to the community and job centre.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his or her apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto does not find any private apartments.
It does not function until now, in this case, you need to rely on private apartments, according to Deschle.
Therefore, conventional apartments must be provided, as it is called, as beautiful.
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments has it not been done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a firm stay, there are internships, training places, school venues, one-Euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established.
“More places would be good,” says Regine Customer.
Many work in the building or help housemasters, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very well-mannered, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that working for the public sector will lead to a positive external effect.
That’s “no employment therapy”
But activity does not just mean work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and Customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So we need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
This is also where administration and honorary officials come in.
It is central to the fact that refugees feel they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
You must explain to refugees that it takes time and they can bridge time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
If anyone ever develops the feeling that he can help no one in Urbach, he should not work and be useless, he will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there are also problems, says the customer honestly, “people who don’t have anything to do with, so the work of Deschle and the customer is always to motivate others.
All of this is already a 'self-examination'.
A difficult question: Do the two, after the recent events, fear radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
\"No - says Regine customer very clearly, what some might call naive - a remaining risk, but they don't want to exclude.
However, the helpers are already aware.
These incidents are also the subject of refugees.
They had the fear that the assassins would call them completely.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine Customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So the main and honorary officials must keep an eye on activities on the site and in the region.
They always have in mind that soon a new shock could come to Urbach from refugees and migrants.
Does Germany need a border?
To answer that question clearly, the policy seems to be at stake.
Actually, it is unfair to put your helpers on the ground.
“In Urbach we haven’t arrived where we were going,” says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are also already burdened out to properly integrate the previous people.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you need to help them, both women agree.
The political situation is so complicated because there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Einbrecher with helicopter sought
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men were violently entered into an apartment in a multifamily house in the Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8:50 a.m.
The inhabitants surprised the two and threw the keeps into flight.
The two men were approximately 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, wearing both blue jeans and black hoods.
They fled to downtown.
The police used several strip crews as well as a police helicopter.
The investigation was unsuccessful.
Perhaps the unknowns appeared before the fact near the apartment or when they fled.
Baden-Württemberg: Police determine after rocker attack on imbiss

After that, two guests were attacked and one easily injured.
Afterwards they fled.
At the imbiss and at the adjacent building, there was a damage of 10000 euros.
According to the investigators, it is a dispute in the Ulmer Rocker Environment between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
