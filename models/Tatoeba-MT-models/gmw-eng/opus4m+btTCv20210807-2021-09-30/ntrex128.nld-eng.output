Members of the National Assembly of Wales worry that they “will be compared to Muppets”
There is controversy among the members of the National Assembly of Wales by a proposal that their title would be changed to MWP (member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name is found ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP “raises on Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poep.
A member of the Wales National Assembly of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is \"disappointed\" and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party is ‘open’ to the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short you.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently preparing legislation to implement the name change, said: “It is, of course, the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who take the final decision on their new title.”
Under the Government of Wales Act 2017, members of the National Assembly of Wales were entitled to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people believed that the National Assembly should be converted to Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in public consultation.
At present, the members of the National Assembly would suggest alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have difficulty reaching a consensus, and in a few weeks they will have to draft a bill on the changes.
The legislation on the reforms also includes other amendments to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the Committees system.
Members of the National Assembly will definitely be able to vote on their new title when they discuss the legislation.
The inhabitants of Macedonia vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, voters vote whether they want to change the name of their country to ‘Republic of North Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve an attractive dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to requests from Macedonia to join the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the popular council on the change of name, has said he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, state that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks of Saint Martin's silence, those of Harlem have it hard
“The older people with whom I spoke said that there was a café and a church located here at every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
Today there is neither a café nor a church.\"
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
“People have social contact in a different way,” he said.
“Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people go regularly.”
However, he is concerned that the profits of the sale of the church’s assets will go less long than the leaders expect, “and early or late they will be back at the beginning.”
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would not help in the remaining resorts of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be blank,” he says, “which will lead to these churches being closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will become members of the church community.”
Both churches were once built by a white church church, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolitan community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church of white Methodists was abandoned in the 1930s.
A black church from the area took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church under the direction of Honor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers in 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939, the building was seriously damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Honor Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a bee.
David Johnson, the son of Honor Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the beaard \"the bells of the poor.\"
The expert who played the bee in July referred in a different way to the instrument: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bee in the world ever to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bee of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's had not replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the church's laymen, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish consisting of laymen) wrote the diocese in July to express her concern that the diocese would ‘despite the costs’ to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in renting the architects and contractors who had sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark injured 13-year-olds who dove to creeks in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the creative season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who went to a creek in California.
The attack took place just 7 o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had spent about half an hour with friends on Saturday when he heard the boy yelling for help.
Hammel said that he first thought the boy was crying because he had caught a crow, but then he realized that the boy was crying, “I’m sorry!
I'm sorry!\"
His key leg was completely open,” Hammel saw when he approached the boy.
“I screamed that everyone had to go out of the water, ‘There is a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is supposed to be in danger of life.
It is not clear which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Beach guard Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that a shark had been mocked nearby a few weeks earlier, but that one had then concluded that it was not about a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured to the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break through the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and aims beauty departments in where specialized assistants work, such as in large estates.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the UK beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while selling fashion and household items continues to decline. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country. If they prove to be successful, they will be introduced into even more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the decks where TVs, microwaves and interior items once stood.
Sainsbury's wants to double its beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Twezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees is also given more place, with benchmarks by brand, such as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique make-up back to the market, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something a little younger shoppers are demanding more and more.
In addition, Parfumerie the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury’s stores. The first is opened earlier in Croydon, in south London, the second will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and increasingly buy small amounts of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to do more to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says the stores will look more and more like big estates, now that the supermarket chain takes it up against Aldi and Lidl discounts, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have generated more return.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its Departments Beauty and Apotheque a make-over, it became a flip.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots, but the cooperation was ended when a conflict arose over the distribution of income from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacies in the stores three years ago for an amount of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: ‘We have completely changed the design of our beauty department so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our brand offer, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products with us, and no longer shopping in the old way.’
Peter Jones 'worried' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'worshiping' because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is compared to the brand Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning’s 37-year-old presenter announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is rushing at Holly Willoughby because she has recently retired from their profitable lifestyle company to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was ‘worshiping’ when Willoughby announced Tuesday at a difficult meeting at the company’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that she was not spending enough time for Truly, their homewear brand and accessories due to her new contracts (with a value of another and a half million pounds).
The company is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby’s fortune of an estimated 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said, “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would ensure its future in the long term, and provide enough for the next decades.
Everyone was surprised when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse of the main facility in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothes and homewear, and because the launch could now be further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two sets often go together on vacation and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of the program I'm A Celebrity on the British ITV station.
A source from Jones's entourage said last night: “We have no comment on his business issues.”
Hard language “and then love was between us”
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media for a comment he made that some people would find ‘unfit for a president’ and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have begun.
More than three months after the summit meeting in Singapore in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a ‘conform response’ by the United States after the first disarming initiatives of North Korea.
Meanwhile, the United States continues its sanctions to keep pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
“We are doing very well in North Korea,” he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have led to positive results. The rocket tests have ended, hostages have been freed and the material excesses of U.S. soldiers have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get access to these busy arenas, there would be about 200 people here,” Trump said while he was in front of the public.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia ravaged an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population no longer had a home, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for launching international aid.
“In many cases, it is unfortunately clear that they are not asking for international help, which is difficult for us,” Ms Sumbung said.
Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, but it’s not sure if the help providers from abroad can work on the site.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the agency for aid in national disasters, said Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would get permission to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still very poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to hide from tsunamis, but along other coasts you rarely see them.
That there was no warning siren for tsunamis in Palu, even though a warning of force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Even in ideal circumstances, it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was located in Lombok to treat victims of earthquakes is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship has reached the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia’s deplorable infrastructure formed one of the core points of the election campaign of President Joko Widodo, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the government of President Yoko has to deal with a lack of funding, and that while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Yoko is also pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs were fighting on the streets, with machetes, arrow and bow and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool provides impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge prevented Liverpool from losing Chelsea in the Premier League last Saturday, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a match at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team was behind 1-0.
He typed left against the ball and then kicked in the direction of the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penitentiary area, in the direction of the top right corner of the net.
He awakened the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching and daring an attempt. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked on the ball.”
Chelsea was at peace with 1-0, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The top of The Blues kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, and then he rushed through the midfield to the playground of Liverpool.
Kovacic did a quick one-second on the midfield.
Then he gave a beautiful pass, allowing Hazard to reach the prison area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool on the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool will play on Wednesday at 15 o’clock in the group stage of the Champions League against Napoli, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea takes up videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15 o’clock in London.
The death toll of tsunamis in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, said the agency for aid in national disasters Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that had been destroyed as a result of the earthquake with a power of 7.5 from last Friday, with waves of 6 m high, said spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman is killed
This morning a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 hours in Grayson Mews, John Street. The body showed sting wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police ask locals to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation has just begun, but I want anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen something suspicious or heard requests to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, in particular taxi drivers, to contact us if they may have filmed anything through a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential to our research.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found to be a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman on the spot came to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one is allowed to enter or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have said to someone that the area is being treated as a place of crime.
A woman appeared crying on the scene.
She continues to repeat: “What a shame!”
At 14 hours, two police cars were inside the decommissioning and a third were just outside.
Within the settlement, a number of agents kept an eye on the apartment building.
If you have information, you are asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, to contact 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously at the number 0800 555 111, indicating log 247 of 30 September.
View of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history'-rel
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects carried out by its fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s suggestion as “dewish” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate about removing statues would lead to the vision of Oliver Cromwell’s figure just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the past century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, created by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the description of a figure that, according to many, still needs to be recognized.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely correct representation is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered.”
Murderous pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, of whom only the surname ‘Yuan’ was known, was found dead at a stall on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His butcher was boarded and he was under the blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the vaccination of pigs at a pig farm, on May 30, 2005, in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He was supposed to have left Yunnan on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and appeared to open a door to a nearby pig stable.
According to the cousin, there was a large male pig with blood on his mouth in the pig's cage.
A forensic study showed that the farm had killed the pig of 250 kg, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeding and mutilated,” said the cousin with the surname ‘Wu’, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
In images of surveillance cameras, it can be seen that Yuan arrived on the market on Thursday at 4.40 hours to feed its pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not of Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked to prevent it from attacking others while the police collected evidence on the site.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are currently talking about a compensation for his death.
It rarely happens, but there have been cases of pigs that attack people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against its tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News testified that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger aggression.
“They are just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they're not going to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's tail brings heavy rain to the southwest of the US
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as she has reached the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. local time, and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a truce begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the peninsula Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the US.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the south-west in the next few days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, debris, and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Tropical moisture will result in precipitation of from 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain 5 to 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There are sudden floodings with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly discouraged to enter the desert on foot when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can ravage in deserted rivers, and storms will produce local windfalls and dust.
The approaching trough brings some heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
There is rain of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small debris currents and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in the rainy season.
Spreading tropical rains will approach Arizona Sunday evening until Monday morning, after which the rain Monday will be more widely spread at the end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the Four Corners Tuesday and will continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the U.S. temperature can fluctuate strongly, as the North Pole becomes cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to major differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the sustained summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the middle and east of the U.S., October was expected to start warm, with temperatures fluctuating around 30° C., from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, Tuesday can be 27 degrees, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that by mid-October the chance is high at above average temperatures in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
On Thursday, more than 20 million people looked at one of the six television networks to see Brett Kavanaugh’s touching witness, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an attack that was reportedly taking place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasts interrupted the regular programming for Friday’s surprise: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, Arizona’s Senator, to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Justice that she is 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh had touched her and tried to pull her clothes out at a party in high school.
Kavanaugh stated in a intended testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
Perhaps more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen watched on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate figures available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking at an office.
For comparison: this is about as for a playoff of a football match or for the Oscar range.
Fox News Channel, which gives Kavanaugh's appointment all support, had the most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the audience remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the cameras of CNN and CBS registered on Friday morning that protesters shouted at him when he tried to take the lift to a hearing from the Commission for Justice.
He continued to stand for a few minutes with broken eyes as he was humiliated, live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here for you,” said one woman.
Do you think he told the people the truth?
Someone called out, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had released a statement, and closed just before the lift, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various broadcasters broadcast everything live when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote before that understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee against the next week, something that the Democrats of the minority insist on.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flakes' choice was important because it was clear that Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of \"a political game\" around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union with the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May will attend the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson emphasised his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit, saying that her proposal that Britain and the EU should enter each other’s taxes was ‘absurd’.
Shooting Party Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect for the shooting, killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison for murder suspects, Baton Rouge police said.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a television station of CBS.
The police questioned Simpson and later stated he had known that he had shot Wayde with death.
His bail was set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
On Friday, the local body viewer in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death is a shot wound in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and local residents all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
Sport Director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked local police for his ‘incentive and striving for justice.’
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was “captivated” and “in shock” by Waydes.
“This is an event that you always hope will never happen,” Wade says.
Vulcan spews as in Mexico City
The ash spewed by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Ram Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater was picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ash were registered in a 24-hour period.
The center detected several times smells and vibrations.
On social media photos of a thin layer of ash appeared on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicals have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital. This is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a power of 7.1 hit the scale of Judge central Mexico.
The volcano, called “Don Goyo” has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists succeeded in the riot policy, while thousands of participants in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia that broke out the region in two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were stopped by the riot police besieged the agents with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, screens broke out with the police, and the agents took their knees up to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: ‘Don’t forget, don’t forgive’, while their opponents cry ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for slight injuries they went up during the protests, the local press reported.
The tensions remain high in the independence-minded region, one year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters expressed overwhelmingly to become independent, although the rise was low and the people opposed to separation were boycotting.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting in the polling offices in the region, leading to violent screenings.
Pro-independence groups had camped on site the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who, along with his wife, attended the separatist protest, said he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia to become independent.
“Last year we experienced one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents cry of joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck,\" he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties won an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was niptious, this year it was difficult for them to continue to build on their success. After all, many of their most famous leaders are absent, either in themselves imposed exile or in captivity awaiting a court case on their role in organizing the referendum and calling for independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old technician who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been stopped by politicians on both sides.
“The tensions are rising more and more,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in preliminary custody since the end of last year, declared that he will participate in the European parliamentary elections next year.
“A candidate for the European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Home Framed With a Car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was repeatedly framed in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday around 19.30 hours local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
At some point, a crossbow may also have been fired on the car.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 matches since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came up with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed this season to win a championship during the Premiership. They have to record Sunday against leader Hearts, who stands for eight points on them.
But first, the Rangers Rapid Vienna will receive Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston has remained unbeaten. The team has won six matches in his division, and coach Holt has not yet had a single defeat since he had been replaced by Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
The team of Holt had long been able to achieve a lead for the first goal. Their direct way of playing was to create all kinds of problems at the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who was picking Craig Halkett's headball, kicked the ball over the goal.
The home team allowed the Rangers to play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances calmly and confidently.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free trap and Livingston made an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scored from the penitentiary area.
At the time, the Rangers had ball possession for a long time, but the defense of the home team was unmovable and goaltender Liam Kelly had not yet had to do much.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure Kelly had to prevent a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball against the feet of Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a performance by his colleagues of Livingston.
Continued efforts were made to reach the Livingston prison area, but each time they were gunned. Two times a penitentiary was refused, one after Halketts attacked intruder Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
\"Fenomenal\" of Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played without exception excellent and still exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and composition of their teams have hardly changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has swung up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Leader Halkett was fantastic, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall ran throughout the match on the tops of their toes.
The Rangers, however, did not know how to break.
Even though they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they only managed once to scale the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they should play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the class.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a bright blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went together on Saturday (29 September) breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne for the opening of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police called for security reasons when they stopped the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathisers came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, also heard their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10.15 hours local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance personnel were present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago another cyclist died in an accident with a flight accident on Childers Street, about half a mile from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said agents were busy identifying the man and his closest family.
The road is closed in several places, buses are redirected and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin's Prison: Six Copiers Injured at Order Disruption
Six policemen have been injured in an order crash in a severely secured prison for men, according to the prison agency.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9.30 p.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still underway.
Specialized ‘Tornado’ cops have been used to resolve situation, involving eight prisoners in one department.
The capers were treated there for light injuries in the face.
A prisoner spokesperson said: “There has been special training in prison personnel used for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and the responsible persons are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind the bars for longer.\"
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the director of the prison had been treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot police were called to jail for a serious order failure in which staff were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (with possible positive effects for drought areas)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy is moving across the southwest of the desert area, causing risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already given warnings for sudden flooding for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will be raining on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in Phoenix’s 200 miles!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great basin, will probably get 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For areas that do not risk flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very stressful, some of this rainfall will likely be beneficial, as the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are indicated, a little over 40 percent of Arizona's drought is causing at least extreme drought, the after-highest category,\" reported weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa's route reaches the mainland via the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still on hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, depleting them.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive Monday afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm in Mexico.
There can be heavy rain in parts of Mexico, causing a significant flood risk.
“A total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,” reported weather.com.
Rosa moves northward across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours, as a tropical depression, which will then take place Tuesday evening through Arizona and south Utah.
“The biggest danger expected of Rosa or her tail is very severe rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and the southwest of the desert,” said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden flooding and debris in the deserts and earthquakes in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsummer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stroke was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday at about 4 o'clock local time in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is “stable.”
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area at night, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking anyone who might have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh \"has been among the common people, the anger\" of the Democratic Party.
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the uncompromising and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure, Kavanaugh was constantly \"suffering under the community, the anger\" of the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified to Congress and denied powerful and emotional the abduction of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her injunction.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw “the beautiful and incredible character, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that recognizes one of the most complete legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,” he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s appointment when he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the interim elections.
“Over five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
I'm not taking part, but I'm actually taking part,\" he said.
“That’s why I come everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to \"resist and hinder us.\"
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be expected to take place by Friday, a top employee of the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds are killed by Indonesian earthquakes, tsunamis, and the toll is getting higher
During a major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, many of which were swept away when giant waves crashed on the beach, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of about six meters high landed at the time it began to scorch. Many people collapsed and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a power of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk away immediately and became the victim of the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Bureau for Natural Disasters BNBB during a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami also led to other dangers: he pulled cars, tree trunks, houses with them, he touched everything on the land,” said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami had traveled at a speed of 800 km/h across the open sea before reaching the coastline.
Some people climb into a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
In aerial photos released by the Center for Natural Disasters, it is evident that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been destroyed and collapsed and a mosque has been surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was rocked by aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released during the massive Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, has yet to increase the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “obvious” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
Some fatal victims were trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, about 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and the damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala “slightly flat, we don’t have any information at all,” Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living,” said the Red Cross in a statement. The Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” the Red Cross said.
The organization received much criticism on Saturday because they had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said the waves had reached the country within the time the warning had been given.
In amateur images shared on social media, it is heard how a man on the upper floor of a building screams in panic to people on the street down to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
A few minutes later, a wall of water crashed on the coast and buildings and cars were pulled down.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a major power crash that cut off the communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo aircraft with auxiliary goods from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacués are still in urgent need of food and other basic needs.
The city’s airport is only reopened for assistance and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit Evacuation Centres in Palu on Sunday.
Death toll of tsunami rises above 800.
It's very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have, however, arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their office are searching for shelter in tents of deck, but were passing along scenes of destruction, Dosaba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began with the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers could not travel to Palu with great expertise.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, goods and personnel from abroad can only be allowed if the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘O.K., this is a national disaster,’ we can provide international assistance, but that status is still not declared.”
When the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing hope that they would find their loved ones back to life, as in the miracles that people like to hear in the face of terrible natural disasters like these.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a pool.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped two days under the rubble with her mother's corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had been held earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread into the paragliding community and that in the hours that followed, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
However, at his messages, only one gray pink appeared instead of two blue fins.
“I think that means the messages haven’t been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while delivering money automatic in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling up a cash car in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release by the Newport Police.
The driver had just emptyed a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, as Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
When he was busy, another man ran behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee, according to the press report, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators is asked to contact the Newport Police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change on Twitter with the words: “The being formally known as Kanye West”.
The 41-year-old West has been briefly named Ye and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for “emotional reasons,” says the show’s creator.
Ye is not only an abbreviation of his current artist's name. Earlier West told all that the word has a religious meaning for him.
According to me, ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,’ said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album to radio presenter Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, we are.
I have moved from Kanye, which means “the only one,” to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He is not the only famous rapper who changes his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who worked with West in the past, has also worked with and without the pair sign and uppercase letters.
Mexican President does not promise to use armed forces against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against citizens. The country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he would never use military force to suppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, military troops fired on a peaceful procession on the square, killing 300 people. During that period, left-wing student movements were established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs due to unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
United States must double funding from A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount they spend on research from A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this in light of the announcements about A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: by 2030, the country wants to be number 1 in terms of A.I. innovations.
“The budget for research into A.I. would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.,” Lee said.
A double of funding can lead to a double of the chance that the next major event for A.I. in the U.S. will take place this week, Lee said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in Face++, one of China’s most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated the best player of American Othello, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee expressed appreciation for technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next contest would take place, as it would help to discover the following visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
“China doesn’t include our best academics, the companies do,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have acquired the best of universities to work on A.I.
Lee said that U.S. efforts on A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“Whoever is a doctor on A.I. should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council has released its development plan for artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to employees of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve partners from industry and the academic world in the initiative, and announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, the U.S. legislation that should lead to the establishment of a National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence has been underway for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the possible change in their country’s name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change to the name of their country in ‘The Republic of North Macedonia’, which would result in a dispute with Greece that had been addressed for decades and would no longer hinder Greece’s Macedonian application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbor means that the country claims Greek territory. Consequently, Greece opposed its veto to the capture of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign is not sure that the required rise of at least 50 percent will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot has been formulated as follows: ‘Are you an advocate of NATO membership and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
“Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, find that the price to be paid is worth trying to join institutions like the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that was formed when the former Yugoslavia broke out.
“I am coming today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us, said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, sufficient members of parliament have indicated that they will respect the outcome, thus determining it.
For the name change, a two-thirds vote would be required in Parliament.
The National Election Committee said there had been no reports of irregularity at 13 hours.
However, the rise was only 16 percent at that time, compared with 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of the registered voters came to vote.
“I come to vote because it’s important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said the 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018, during the referendum on the change in the country’s name that would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
For the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people who boycotted the referendum.
“We are supporters of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as full-fledged members, and not through a back gate,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will generate much-needed investments for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I am convinced that the vast majority is more supportive, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said that a ‘yes’ would be a ‘confirmation of our future’ as a result.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required rise.
Another poll, conducted by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of that, 70 percent would vote.
If the referendum wants to be successful, then the rise must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short measurements defending Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in the English Manchester. Manchester City won the match with 2-0.
It looked like a whisper of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine peak first got the ball played on the midfield.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, right into the open field.
There, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He managed to pass a defender and was also too quick for some others on the edge of Brighton’s prison area.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the prison area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right-hand shoe to defeat goaltender Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
‘Aguero is suffering from problems with his feet,’ coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City told the press.
“We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that time.\"
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was in the playing field of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a while and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player typed the ball into the net just before he was too far.
On Tuesday at 12.55 am, City will take you to Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The match will take place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play and it doesn't make the Rockies easy to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the playoff, there was little reason to force a new start.
Nevertheless, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to play on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still consequences for the Rockies’ participation in the playoff. They are currently standing one match on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least made a wildcard for the playoff thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but now want to put everything in place to ensure their first division title.
“While there is nothing left for us, we can at least pitch with the science that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level I would meet this year.
Why don't I want to play with it?\"
The Nationals still need to announce who will be on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to put Scherzer up as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would launch his 34th, was in the injection field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, though that is normally his rest day.
Washington's right-hand thrower is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organizes meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while speaking about the importance of the Republican rise in the interim elections.
“Everything we’ve already achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections. I don't take part, but I actually take part. That's why I come up everywhere for great candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued: “We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they are determined to take the power back, no matter what they have to do for it. You see the community, the ailingness.
It doesn't matter to them who they hurt, who they have to push away to gain power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them that.\"
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to \"resist and hinder us.\"
“And we’ve seen that over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “boisterous and common and false and lying.”
He named the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is a member of the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to loud calls from the public.
“Do you know what she answered?”
Have you leaked the document?
Eh, eh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.\"
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum in my local party voted to censor me, that was no surprise.
After all, I’m the latest in a whole range of Labour parliament members to get that we’re not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she stood up decisively against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough issues similar to those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was stated: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
And that was also the case during most GC meetings on Friday evenings during the eight years I have been a local Labour Member of Parliament.
Unfortunately, today it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a ‘kinder, softer’ policy has long been forgotten, if it had ever begun.
It becomes increasingly clear that a disparate opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable for the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader. Collegas, who had a similar political view as I knew, suddenly expected to turn around and take a position I would never have agreed with, from subjects such as national security to the European single market.
Whenever I speak to a public, whatever I say, there are social media parties calling for the rejection of my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next elections, where the politics of the centre is being put to the fore and I am told that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that some guilty parties are apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘motion of distrust’ or change of selection rules, the party becomes less spirited.
I have often been advised to keep me focused over the past two years, not just to proclaim my opinion loudly, and then I would ‘not get into trouble’.
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I became a school child of Labour 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of the government of Thatcher, which literally caused my delegation to collapse, I have always pleaded for better public services for those they most need, both in my role as a councillor and in my role as minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, not even in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my issues with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the Friday motion, I can only say one thing: when the country moves on to a Brexit that will damage families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I have only one message, and that is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next elections or political opportunities will not stop me from acting according to what I believe is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: unbeaten Ayr on the way to the top
Two late try's may have pulled the final result somewhat, but there's no doubt that Ayr triumphs correctly in this wonderful game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the class, the only unbeaten team of ten.
In the end, it was both their superior defense and their better chances of winning the home team, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
“We’ve had it so far during our matches and we’re still unbeaten, so I’m a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: ‘All honor to Ayr, they have used their opportunities better than we do.’
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but by a yellow card from Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors contest), Melrose was able to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot managed to break down a try.
Climo took a penalty for an extra lead for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solo just for the rest. Thus, it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson’s try, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match remained silent for a long time for a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who was fired on a brancard, and once the match was restarted, Ayr was able to continue to run through a try by Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then Ayr's leader Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and recalculated Melrose with the extra man when no conversion followed up on a Bruce Colvine's try at the end of a match where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he grabbed Climo without the ball, MacPherson took care of a touch-down on the penalty-line-out behind the rising Ayr-maul.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart again, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent out halfback Gregor Henry for the fifth try of the home team.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Actor Ford Kieran is going out of Still Game in the corner, apparently he is appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself plays with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the “blowing restaurant business” in Glasgow.
The sea is ours: the country-locked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Seagulls patrolling in a truism-covered naval office in La Paz.
On public buildings, an ocean blue flag wails.
At all the marine bases of Lake Titicaca until the Amazon, the motto is: “The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back.\"
Throughout the country surrounded by Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country has had to resist Chile after a bloody nineteenth-century raw material conflict is still alive, just as the desire to recapture the Pacific.
That hope may have reached its highest point in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which should fall on October 1 after five years of consultation.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, of course, looks forward to the result with positive prospects,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will see the judgment of the Court of Justice on large screens, in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will plead in the favor of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of fond talks, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president, who next year stands for a controversial struggle for re-election, is much at stake with Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide for Bolivia, and even if that was the case, little would change.
The UN agency established in the Netherlands does not have the authority to assign the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
That the ruling of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the final remarks, indicates that the case was “not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive result from Bolivia are certainly not improved, on the contrary, over the past four years, the situation may have become even worse.
“The matter of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian government,” Zárate said.
The war-stricken rhetoric of Morales has completely undermined all the good will that Chile may have had, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their conversations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to talk further.
Since 1962, the two countries have not been an ambassador to each other.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court’s decision has been made unusually quickly.
On Monday Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, is using the maritime issue as a political crumb.
“Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot trust it.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the established nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it's a \"utopia\" that the permanent sanctions and the U.S. oppose a statement ending the Korean war, North Korea will ever get on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without Pyongyang taking important steps in the field of disarming.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second top meeting.
But there is scepticism and it is doubted that Pyongyang is serious when he says he would ignore an arsenal that the country probably sees as his only way to ensure his safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second top meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge main covers, soon for sale near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversized head coverings for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking set during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very unusual hats this summer were not to think away from Instagram and these designers have sent their eye-blinding creations the catwalk on.
The striking piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a furthest wide edge, hanging over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermeloned with gemstones, a sorcerer’s hat and even an ananas, but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
For many of the colourful masks, the lips were closed. They looked more on Hannibal Lecter than on skin couture.
The one creation looked like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you are lucky.
Stylewatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing shops near you.
The giant hats may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very unpractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also made for another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in bath suit that the bag fused with.
The red orange raffia bag, set off with raffia frances and finished with a white leather hengsel, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the stores next summer. As the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with a series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives of the entire community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for continuing and higher education, their career and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desired subjects at excellent levels within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t rely only on English when we want to build relationships and a trust bond with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results of this year, we can derive that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data collected from 74 schools affiliated with SCIS shows that 72 percent of students achieved a high score (“A”) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of students in German, 69 percent of students in French and 63 percent of students in Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now as much appreciated as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A study by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of the obstacles to fill jobs 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language knowledge, according to employers.
Language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future career.
Now that more and more jobs require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such skill for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage in competition.
According to a YouGov poll, among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation. French was the only language to speak above 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today’s children.
Several languages can speak, especially those of emerging economies, will offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach.
Some schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the UK as they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specialized in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed regardless of the future.
It cannot currently be denied that languages remain vital in a global business environment for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered to be “International communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening match on the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday before the season.
It still needs to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers schedule for the six matches prior to the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need any games before the season to prepare me,” he said.
Times of Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a long series of election rallys tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia
It is Trump's first five planned rallys in the coming week, including stops in places that are so close to him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he elects for the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been put in wait, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when it is abolished in November.
What time does Trump’s rally start in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, started tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 a.m.
You can watch Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably have it about the hearings for candidate judge Brett Kavanaugh of this week. These were charged extra now Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallys is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the November elections to get more elan.
President Trump’s campaign leader said that these five rallys will be intended to “encourage volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“Control over Congress is so important to its program that the President travels to as many states as possible now the busy campaign season begins,” said a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be mentioned by name against Reuters.
The rally tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday, the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep hope alive in the run-up to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of opportunities is a fully invented sports concept, but a true player really believes in, and especially in competitions like this.
So who is currently getting the best chances?
“They first had a lead of six points, and now that’s just four more, so we find so much happiness right now on our side,” Jordan Spieth said before leaving at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of standing four points, while there are twelve more.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points of the four.
Spieth has been a fearless opponent from tea to green, and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial putt with which the match four became a success when he and Thomas scored two points after two matches.
His putt with which she won the match on 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can derive that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
“You have to dig deep and just worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable but wonderful European duo has four in four and can do nothing wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only duo that played no bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogey’s.
As a result of this series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players to be defeated Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to book a European victory when the sun goes down above Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
However, it is a prelude to speaking of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front Nine led to a backlash for the Spaniard and the Swedish they no longer came up with.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help get your back on.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change at a glance.
The European team has played the best so far and has a great lead in the run-up of the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to engage in the fight, something that some, especially in the U.S., are arguing.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a beautiful lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After Saturday's four-balls and foursomes, they stand 10-6 in the United States.
The intended duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, who had it hard, making them lead four points in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who wanted to lose the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two matches, but could no longer capture his back.
Jim Furyk's team must score eight points during Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in row, while he and Molinari, who were nicknamed Molliwood, are only the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening matches.
After making Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully played together and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who made his way through two games on Saturday, occasionally showed a beautiful set, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven-yard.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three in the world, with 2&1.
However, it was not of a considerable length for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze to the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won a hard match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to pick up a four-point back at the beginning of the singles, although the team of Furyk has enough to equalise, as they currently have the trophy in their hands.
But now that they have been in second place for two days, a counter-attack on Sunday seems to be too high.
North Korea says “in no case” will disarm one-sided without trust
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations that the ongoing sanctions are leading to more and more distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances, the country would not be able to give up its nuclear weapons on one side.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the location for nuclear testing, and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see a corresponding response from the US,” he said.
“Without any confidence in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way disarm ourselves.”
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a ‘phased’ approach to nuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it takes further steps, it was noted that he did not a priori reject the unlateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang used to do.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work towards the “denucleization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees for the safety of North Korea.
North Korea is pursuing a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. urges ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of war,’ Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only strengthen our distrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second top meeting between Kim and Trump, something that the U.S. leader had raised earlier in the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If the other party were at this issue of nuclearisation South Korea and not the US, the nuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been such an impasse.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different than last year, when he said the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles were directed to the U.S. mainland so that after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a ‘ rocketman’ on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim with the United Nations for his courage to step in to disarm, but said that there is still a lot to do and that the sanctions must remain nuclearized until North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this: ‘whether it’s two years, three years or five months, that doesn’t matter.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
But on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: “The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be firmly and firmly maintained until we have realized the full, final, verified degenerativeization.”
The Security Council has passed unanimous sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to greatly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said next month he would go back to Pyongyang to make preparations for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not well.
Within a few hours of leaving Pyongyang in July and saying that progress had been made, North Korea suggested that he would set \"passing demands.\"
North Korea promised this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantling a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take \"conform measures.\"
He said Kim had said to him that the “dealing measures” he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will ensure that all students get more sleep, in an attempt to combat the growing machoculture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor noted that the students of the world’s largest university often have no idea of the basic principles of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course. As far as he knows this is unique in the US.
He was given the idea of starting the course after giving a speech on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why do I get to hear this now, in my last year?’
She said no one ever told her how important sleep is, what surprised me,\" he told The Telegraph.
In the course, which is organized for the first time this year, the basic principles are explained to the students of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was determined that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see an image of a dormitory, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise devices and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance are affected by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine when going to sleep.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep shortage increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Using a campus basis, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that we will not change students’ behavior immediately.
But we find that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know what consequences the choice of cigarettes has on their health, adds Czeisler.
The culture of proudness on a night-to-night study still exists, he says, and due to modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep shortage is an ever-increasing problem.
To ensure sufficient sleep, of good quality, the student’s ‘secret weapon’ must be to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep shortage causes the brain to be constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Calfornia who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the course because he had studied with the professor last year when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to make sure that the course became available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, and not just an alarm to stand up. They should also be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronics screens and LED lighting, which can rob you of a circular rhythm, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga target defeats Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their competition run again disappointingly when Dolly Menga scored and the weak team of Steven Gerrard defeated 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox had hoped for a first victory during a match since they defeated St. Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team led the defeat, almost the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 matches. His team is now at eight points behind Hearts, which went on to the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored for the rest seven minutes, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers are now heading to sixth place, Livingston is rising to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could have even more problems, as border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a major wound after apparently an object was thrown to him by the visitor team’s supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team. They crossed Ayr and went to the half-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed at the same eleventh place for Livingston, who knew the Hearts had a point to snuff off last week. He would have been trained on how his well-trained team had managed to block the opponents at each set.
The Rangers may have had the most ball possession, but Livingston did more.
They had to score after two minutes, when Menga went off the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the vizier, but the midfielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free trap of Keaghan Jacobs reached leader Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked against the back pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than that they really believed in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found that he was entitled to a penitentiary when he and Steven Lawless clashed after a quarter of playing, but Judge Steven Thomson threw away the request of the Colombian.
The Rangers could only shoot twice to the goal in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who used to be a goalkeeper at the Ibrox, was able to keep the headball of Lassana Coulibally and the bottom shot of Ovie Ejaria with ease.
Livingston’s opener in the 34th minute may or may not be in the extension of the general game course, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it was just their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were not up against Jacobs' deep playing pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball on to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and selected Menga, who took the ball with ease to the goal.
Gerrard led to a cancellation with the Coulibay/Ryan Kent exchange, which had almost immediate consequences when the winger Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly racet away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play the kind of game that Livingston prefers to play, with Lithgow and Halkett playing long balls.
The team of Holt had been able to increase its lead in the final stage of the match, but McGregor stood well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came out wide from the corner.
Invaders Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked at the end of the match for a penalty after an attack with Jacobs, but Thomson looked back on the other side.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the almanak of our ‘Sunday Morning': 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom it is possible to celebrate well... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the geigerteller.
Since then, the breeder has not been able to think away from science, and also became an icon in pop culture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film with the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans at first sight:
Man: ‘What is that in God's name?'
Rogers: “That’s a geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this headphone, you hear the effect of the atoms expressed by radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “It’s really hurting now!”
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, almost a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.

The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them into a labo
They can then ‘see’ a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and are then re-injected
A test vaccine produces promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that the immune system learns to recognize evil cells saw her ovary cancer disappear for more than 18 months
In the method, immune cells are removed in a patient, after which the cells in the labo are adapted in such a way that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which often occurs in all types of cancers.
Professor Jay Berzovsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “From our results it appears that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovary cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzovsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and “learn” these cells to address cancer cells has previously proved to work in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West rejects pro-Trump-tirade and wears MAGA-pet after its appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That wasn’t what he hoped
Kanye West was released on Saturday Night Live’s broadcast after an inconsistent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he will become Presidential candidate in 2020.
After he had brought his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with on his head a pet with the text Make America Great Again, he stepped down a tirade against the Democrats and repeated that he was supporting Trump.
“Many times when I’m talking to a white person, he asks, ‘How can you now have sympathy for Trump? He’s a racist!’”
When I was worried about racism, I had been out of America for a long time,” he said.
Saturday Night Live’s broadcast began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon struck the dragon with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Committee on Justice in connection with the alleged assault of which Christine Blasey Ford accused him.
The tirade of West was not broadcast, but comic Chris Rock uploaded them on social media.
It's not clear whether Rock wants to hit the dragon with his post with West.
West also complained to the public that he had been caught under fire for his pet.
“They drove me backstage.
They said, “Don’t stand on the stage with that pet.”
They've been tearing me!
And then they say I'm apathetic,\" he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see what apathetic looks like?” He said that he would attract her superman-cape, “because that means you can’t order me. Do you want the world to get better?
“Give me some love.”
From the public, at least twice the call came and the cast members of the SNL looked embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was told of a presence: ‘The entire studio was suddenly quiet.’
West was guest as last-minute substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the conservative group’s leader, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of our most courageous spirits: BEDANKT THAT YOU ARE THE MASSA TROTSEERT.”
But talk show presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply ‘just himself, and that’s wonderful.’
“But I choose not to reward someone who is harming my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do what he wants.
“We too,” she added.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, “the creature that is formally known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collega rapper Snoop Dogg has also been named Snoop Lion and the deceased music legend Prince has ever changed his name to a symbol and then to The artist formally known as Prince.
Complaints of attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was shot down on Friday at a restaurant in the east of Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is expected to appear Monday before the police judge in Belfast.
The charge will be investigated by the Public Ministry.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington takes out to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role of swordfighter Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor takes out to the stereotype of the machoheld and says that young boys often think when seeing such roles on the screen that they should be tough to gain respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt that “there was something wrong” and asked himself how the problem of toxic masculinity should be addressed in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who is recently married to his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
“That’s really an important question for me at the moment: where did it go wrong with our masculinity?” he said.
“What have we learned men when they grew up, so that we are now faced with this problem?”
Kit thinks that television could be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, due to its very male characters.
He continued, “What is born and what is taught?”
What is taught on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that’s one of today’s big questions: how do we change that?
For there is clearly something wrong with young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones when the series is over next summer, because he is ‘ready with battlefields and horses’.
As of November, Kit has been playing in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a conqueror.
The actor recently revealed that his encounter with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
\"I met my wife during the series, so that's how I've kept my future family and my life from now on,\" he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was awarded an Emmy.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were passed on via sex, which was not previously so.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China in the past due to transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people running HIV in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV via sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
According to studies, 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted by inadequate protection in the sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003 the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication in the context of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staffworker has leaked data from Republican senators and draws out to ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘complot theories’
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters opposes the allegations that one of her staff members has posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia page.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the allegations are spread by ‘extremely-right’ disputers and websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more common lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include, among other things, the private address and the private phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a hearing by the Senate Committee on the accusations of sexual misconduct at the address of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate judge for the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three Senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address indicating the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and contained the information of a Waters employee, the Hill said.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie,” Waters said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no case responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie.\"
The statement of Waters has been heard on-line, including by former press employee of the White House Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial sounds angry', Fleischer wrote.
“From this you can open that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a Congress member.
If someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not get angry.
He shouldn't be rebellious.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He has to stay calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare the response of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger during the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take over Waters' place in the interim elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
“Half, if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false accusations.
“We will make the perpetrators known,” she said, “and that they are legally charged for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff workers.”
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new movie with a British impact, we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and that seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films with a sleepy spy in the lead, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was re-launched in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this airy selfatire about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with an outpouring eye and flexible facial features at least manage to send everything in the hundred, including his second comeback. From his name you can already derive that he is a common comic character designed for cinematographers in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a little Clouseau, a wing Mr Bean and a grin of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
He was originally based on the traveller and the international mysterious man Atkinson who ever played in Barclaycard’s TV spots (who has forgotten everyone in the meantime) who always leaves behind a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I found it wonderful how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armour and the rotor leaves to tick against his helmet.
Atkinson can show in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak over and crazy enough, especially now the “serious” film series like 007 and Mission Impossible self comedies include as an ingredient, and do well.
The humor seems intended for children rather than for adults, and Johnny English's doll debate is less original and focused on me than the jokes without the text of the character Bean playing Atkinson.
The constant theme is now that Britain is in great trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, which has made the identity of all active secret agents of Britain known, to the great abduction of the agent in function, a sad little role of Kevin Eldon.
That’s the drop that the bucket overtakes the Prime Minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terriblely unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her utmost with this character that makes Teresa May think, but the script doesn’t offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisors, she has to use a retired spy, as each active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunting Johnny English itself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a Chique institution, but is not teaching informally about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the espionage lessons of English are what make School of Rock think.
English is quickly disbanded at Whitehall for an emergency letter and reunited with his former soulless help Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of an undersea, a turbulent and jovial role that is below Vicki Pepperdines level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are therefore back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloodthirsty women fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is sorry for the charms of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start off at their odyssee of clumsy doll fun: dressed as an uppers they fire a sizable French restaurant, they kick aboard the luxury yacht of Volta and English detains pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make himself familiar with Volta's interior.
For the latter, all registers are opened, but no matter how well-meaning and horrific the scene is, she does what she thinks of children’s television.
It's not all very original.
And, like Johnny English’s other films, I ask myself the question: can the British film industry now really have no role in honoring Rowan Atkinson’s talent?
Labour denies that the party is considering a plan in which British work four days a week, but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party would consider a radical plan in which British people work four days a week, but were paid for five days.
According to the party, bosses of companies would want to pass on the savings they do as a result of the revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day vacation.
For example, employees can enjoy a weekend of three days, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, “the idea fits into the economic agenda of the party and plans to cross the balance of the country in the direction of the workers.”
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Association of Trade Unions, which it finds a good way to ensure workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-placed source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: “The expectation will be announced a policy review before the end of the year.
“It will not take place at one time, but a four-day working week is a goal that is appropriate within the party’s efforts to make the economy more balanced for the benefit of employees and that is also appropriate within the overall industrial strategy of the party.
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party has promised a four-day working week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the aim is not yet supported by the full Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: “A four-day working week is not the party’s policy advance and is not considered by the party.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used Labour’s conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take the power back from the 'faceless drivers' and the 'profiters' from utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not regain the full value of their share, because a Labour government could apply “debts” based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the board of directors of companies and to establish inclusive property funds (including Ownership Funds) to give 10 percent of the shares of private sector companies to employees who can earn up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can make them think
The FBI’s investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least one week and raises the question of whether the findings of the FBI could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday at 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that could lead them to change their opinion.
Kennedy looked more open to this than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I told the hearing that I had spoken to Mr. Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charge came out, and I asked him, \"Did you do it?\"
He was decisive, determined, indivisible.
The voice of Graham seems to be wall-proof.
“My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the charge should contain dynamite,” he said.
“As for Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has denied it powerfully,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And no one named by her could verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments -
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday is organized in New York City’s Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up will take place on stars and that has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, tens of thousands of people will come to Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: to end extreme poverty for 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
Concerters who wanted to empower a free ticket for the event ( unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or \"actions\", such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, telephone conversation, or generate another meaningful awareness for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with another 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call for action or is this just another form of ‘clickivism’, giving people the feeling that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, more than 19 million 'actions' of supporters have been registered, according to Global Citizens, aimed at a large number of different objectives.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to world leaders’ commitment and have made policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that need to change the lives of 2.25 billion people before 2030.
Early in 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, at least $10 billion of which has been paid out or brought together by sponsor actions.
The group estimates that the received funds have so far had an impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important statements of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of helping children realize their full potential. This group has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the British government, of donors, of other national governments and of Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice that is undernourished a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, told the public at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the British government was asked to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government has announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, that 5 million women and children will reach with nutritional interventions.
In answer to one of the most common questions on the Global Citizens website in which was asked — why do you think we can end extreme poverty —
The group replied: “It will be a long and difficult road, where we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, like civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will eventually be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are a few of the artists who will perform this year at the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the Navy for a 'blockage' to hinder Russian exports of energy - Minister of Home Affairs
Washington may take refuge to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from coming to market, including in the Middle East, explained Ryan Zinke, U.S. Minister of Home Affairs, as stated by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country is at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a prelude to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just like in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to cope with this.
“The United States has that possibility, with the Navy, to ensure that the sailing routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy is not on the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke for guests at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without a profit mark that affiliates itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the U.S...
He went on and compared Washington’s approach to Russia with Iran’s approach and noted that these are not essential differences.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a country that only knows a ‘art’, with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump government is trying to boost the exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a country that offers far from the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, officials of the Trump government, including President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the \"unsuited\" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trum van Berlin, has made Moscow's 'prisoner'.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues as an argument that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is only driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we agree with the notion that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves,” said Aleksandr Novak, the Russian energy minister, after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. energy minister, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has sparked a response from Germany, which has confirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously' to participate in the 2020 presidential election, says Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Senator, said on Saturday that she “thinks seriously about it” to participate in the presidential elections after the interim elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about taking part in the elections.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means that a woman in the top position,” she said, according to the political newspaper The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will think seriously about making me elect as president.
Warren ran against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall and said he “sent this country in the wrong direction”
“I’m still worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open to her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, of course, we have to wait for an investigation by the FBI before voting on this.
However, a survey published on Thursday revealed that a majority of Warren’s own attachment finds that she should not be elected in 2020.
Eighty-five percent of Massachusetts’s “probably” voters said that the senator should not be elected, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University and Boston Globe’s Political Research Center.
Twenty-two percent were expected to be elected.
The study showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 percent before a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of leading Democrats associated with a possible participation in the 2020 presidential election are former vice president Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to a report by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSS from Track Palin at a Donald Trump election meeting
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after he took office in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence Monday night.
“By what my own son needs to experience, what he’s experiencing now he’s back, I have understanding for other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSS and the injuries with which some of our soldiers return,” she told the public present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest — the elephant in the room — and said about her son and other veterans — they come back a little differently, they come back and his tougher, they come back and wonder if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given to the country of their homeland —
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and has been charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the U.S. thereby refusing asylum from victims fleeing from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. have filed a statement last Friday as a ‘friend-of-the- Court’ to the Washington court in support of an asylum seeker opposing this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the indictment in Grace vs Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union has filed against federal policy in August has not been announced.
She says that her partner — and his violent sons who are members of a gang — abused her but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of people have come to seek asylum in the US, as countries that know big problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The U.S.’s new asylum policy has reversed a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision, in which it became possible for immigrants without documents that are on the run for domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Washington D.C. Attorney General, said Friday in a statement that the new policy — for decades — ignores state, federal and international legislation.
“Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle to that principle is contrary to that principle - put in the statement of the ‘friend-of-the- Court’.
The lawyers continue to argue that the policy to deny immigrants access to the U.S. is damaging the U.S. economy, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country is \"providing the necessary labour forces.\"
Jeff Sessions, Justice Minister, has ordered judges not to assign asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion,” said Sessions in his announcement on 11 June of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to relieve all problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people get to make every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu while the number of dead doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It feels very exciting,” said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while trying to comfort her feverous baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute new ones arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce.
Residents came back to their ruined homes and searched for valuable items in their well-watered possessions that they could still use.
Hundreds of people have suffered injuries and hospitals have been overpopulated, so far as they have not been damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris who had a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the chance of severe aftershocks.
Trans filled his eyes as he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the rest of the wall, and Haris told a correspondent from the Associated Press and added to this when he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, and later I heard nothing more.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they are safe.
U.S. ambassador accuses China of \"intimidation\" with \"propaganda ads\"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted an advertisement of four pages in an American daily, praising the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China's paid Annex Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa after accusing China of interference in the November 6 U.S. Congress elections, a charge that is denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. elections marked, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, where they have imposed higher import rates on each other.
China’s reimbursement rates early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting opponents in states such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, an important producer of agricultural products to China, said China had hit U.S. employees, farmers and businesses.
China, as Branstad wrote in a statement in Des Moines Register of Sunday, now doubles the harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our free press.
“By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses the freedom of expression and of a free press, a long-chosen tradition in America by placing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at a kiosk in the centre of Beijing, you will find disparaging voices and you will not see a true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people have possible about the difficult economic route, because the media is firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers has refused to publish his article,” as he said, not which newspaper it was.
By the Kavanaugh Debacle, Republicans alienated female voters from themselves just before the interim elections, warning analysts
Now that many important Republicans have scrambled around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various accusations of sexual violence, analysts warn that they will experience a setback, especially among women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions surrounding this topic have risen enormously and most Republicans have already revealed that they want to continue voting.
“These things cannot be reversed,” Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article that appeared Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering whether the attempt of Senator Jeff Flake (Republican, Arizona) to plead for an FBI investigation at the last moment will be sufficient to satisfy the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they’re not forgotten tomorrow and they’re not forgotten in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters — November — called at the Senate Hall during their demonstration while Republicans who controlled the justice committee chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation for Democrats will reach record heights,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
“People say it’s high, and that’s true.
But it can rise even further, especially among floating female voters in the outlying areas and among younger voters, from 18 to 29, who often do not vote even if they disagree with the President.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she further explained her charge of sexual harassment against the candidate before the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that there might be a setback if the Republicans were to press the appointment.
“This has become a confusion for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former Republican Party President, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“Not only is it the vote in the committee, or the final vote, or that Kavanaugh is taking place in court, but it is also the way the Republicans have dealt with this and how they handled it — Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats to be elected, clearly makes clear to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be divided about the question they believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority signing out for the latter.
A new study by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony and that 35 percent believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had either lied or probably during his testimony while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's charges and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford told the Senate’s Justice Committee that Kavanaugh had attacked her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the High Court has shown his genitals to her during a party during the time they both studied at Yale in the 80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new internet to address Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of technology legend, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid offers users the opportunity to choose where their data is stored and which individuals have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that \"world domination\" is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
“We have to do this now,” he said about the startup.
“This is a historical moment.
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
This includes lists of contacts, activities lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it depends entirely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this \"personal empowerment by means of data.\"
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to CEO John Bruce, that the company provides the resources, processes and necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers who have been contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, developers of technology around the world can make their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not going to talk to “Facebook and Google about whether or not introducing a complete transformation that puts all their business models completely on their heads at once.”
“We do not ask for their permission.
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the mission (of Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid -
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential vote in the debate on net neutrality.
Also after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: spiritual and supporter of the Victoria Cross from WO I honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I as a military is honored 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant-Colonel, the honorary Bernard Vann won the award following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sharp shooter, so he never knew that the highest British military honor had fallen to him.
A memorial stone was revealed by its two small zones during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was \"brilliant symbolic\" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 on the Canal de Saint-Quentin — in a very dense fog and under heavy fire of field gun and machine guns — on 29 September 1918.
He later stormed through the fireline and guided the line forward before only running to a field shooter and turning off three members of the Detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sharp shooter on October 4, 1918, a little more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never tip on, but something that makes me feel humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have also laid a cliff after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he \"felt very honored to play a role in the parade - and added that \"the bravery of a real hero turns out to be the support he receives from a large number of people -
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you've stayed awake all night to see a follow-up Bellator 206 and you won't see the most important moment.
On the ticket from San Jose, 13 fights were mentioned, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, viewers in the UK were surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were angry because they had stayed awake all night for this fight.
A fan described the transition to the children’s program on Twitter as “a bad joke”
“In accordance with government regulations, no content that is not suitable for children may be displayed after 6:00 a.m., and therefore we had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
“Peppa the pig,” yessss.
Scott Coker, company president of Bellator, said they are going to adjust their programming to ensure that the viewers in the UK will also be given a chance in the future.
“I think, with a view to the back match, that we can solve this problem,” Coker said.
\"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and believing me, these were not all just kind.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise that this won't happen again.
We limited the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation -
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt \"inferior\" because of his sexual nature
Olympic traveler Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his youth because of his sexual nature, but that this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said he had not realized, until he went to further education, that \"not everyone is like me.\"
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had expressed concern about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that the parenting contributed to his gaining less value during the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show, has been released for a few months due to illness.
Apparently like a rendezvous on Laverne’s first program, Daley told himself that during his youth he felt “less” than others because it was “socially not accepted to like both girls and boys.”
He said: “To this day those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different are really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful.
He wanted to prove that he was \"someone\" so that he wouldn't disappoint people if they eventually came behind his soil.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a striking campaign leader for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he was happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, “has completely surprised me.”
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you have to endure so much, he took part in his first Olympics at fourteen years of age and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same height and low points.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his “whole perspective” had changed.
“If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it all turned to winning a gold medal,” he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My Golden Olympic Medal is Robbie
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after receiving the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked if they had already received the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit on the first row.
“I couldn’t get it about my heart to say, you won’t be there to sit on the first row, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stopped and he died, I finally realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley joined the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew that I had dreamed of this all my life. To dive for a home audience during the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, which had strongly attacked him on his way to the games and which he still got chicken skin from.
Desert Island Discs is to be watched on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he has to find his shape back to avoid making a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who participates in the two-year event for the 12th time, a record, was placed by the team captain Jim Furyk on the bench for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors distributes the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving range, in an attempt to find out what it is short of.
Because he was never known on the peak of his career for his straight drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs runs downing balls routinely.
And if the job itself is not scary enough yet, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson comes against the ever-accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who is linked to newman Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind at the beginning of the 12 single matches, start well, Mickelson's match can be absolutely crucial.
Fury has shown confidence in this man, even though he could honestly say otherwise.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on the back, slammed his arm around me and said he’s ready for it tomorrow,” he said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has been in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two matches.
I expected more, but it's like it's and it's the way we should act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of playing Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never completely scored the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games standing on his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain indisputable impact on the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s taken, he likes to get jokes out with people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team.
“I think the younger players liked to keep him mad at last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that big lead can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European team's captain, knows from experience that the comfortable lead ahead of the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
Deen made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama match, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead on the Americans, but eventually the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we had a great lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just — Bjorn said, called off here, after he had seen the light of 2018 win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 lead on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and all others in the team that this is not a game yet.
Everyone will have to make a full commitment tomorrow.
Get started and carry out the plan on the right.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's this trophy win, and we have to keep focusing on that.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world.
Rejoicing over the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never go ahead on the business in this field.
Tomorrow is waiting for a new challenge.
Tomorrow the individual performance will come to fruition, and that’s another very different discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it's going well, but when you're only standing for it, your capabilities as a golfer are only really tested.
That's the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So let your partner go now, and he must also get the best out of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform individually better than partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has had experience with both sides of this type of conversion on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the ‘Miracle of Medina’.
“I remember every damn word of that speech,” he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had picked up his players for the last day.
“We have 12 important matches for the morning, but let’s try to get started, as in Brookline, or as in Medina.
When we have the momentum, there will be a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have adjusted our line-up to this and sent the men on the way in the order that is, according to us, the best and, you know, we're going to try to spell out something from the high hat tomorrow --
Thomas has the task of trying to guide the counteroffensive and sets Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
“I chose this group in this order because I think we are so constantly covered,” Bjorn said of his selection of single players.
Germany's new warship again suspended
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been employed in 2014 to replace the outdated warships of the Cold War, but it will still take at least one year before it is ready, due to defective systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The establishment of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Palatinatemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit which quotes a military spokesperson.
The vessel should have been part of the Navy in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four branches of the Baden-Buertemberg class, which the Navy ordered in 2007, serve to replace the aged frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a series of air defense and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to use the latest frigates up to two years apart from home ports.
The constant delays, however, mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to give Germany the opportunity to project its power overseas, are ageing by the time they are taken into business, notes Die Zeit.
The fatal frigate F125 had already taken the newspaper headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into operation and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss headquarters in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial \"software and hardware defects\" that would make the warship useless if it were put into a battle mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the men of the Baden-Buertemberg class were served by a crew of about 120 seamen, helping the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship is seriously overweight, which will reduce its performance and limit the capabilities of the Navy to carry out further upgrades.
The \"Rheinland-Palatinate\" weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price ticket for the entire project, including the crew training, is already a problem.
It is said that this has reached a dizzying €3.1 billion, compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest frigates have in their grip are more important because of recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defence committee in Germany, acknowledged that the Navy actually has a shortage of utilable ships.
The official said the problem over time as a snowball has grown, as old ships were pulled out of business but no replacement vessels were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Buertemberg class were yet available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish highlands tries to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will let new light shine on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland follows the usual and small dwarf bat, the brown large butterfly mouse and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the property to track the activities of the bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NTS and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the cry of the bat and what kind of thing it does.
Then a map of the habitat and a report are produced to create a detailed image on landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS’ Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the results show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making pasture fields and how we can best maintain the forests for bats and similar species.
Fleet mouse populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping places and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightnings can also pose a risk, such as flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by house cats.
In reality, bats are not blind.
However, their nightly hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
In the NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly investigate, inspect sleeping places, and sometimes carry out rescue actions.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the three-story property in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten species of bats live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal territory for the bats.
“Here in Threeve we have a great environment for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much about bats not yet known and therefore the work we do here and in other locations will help us better understand what they need to be able to thrive.
He emphasizes the importance of control of bats before maintenance activities are carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping place can lead to the death of 400 female bats and their boys, possibly destroying a full local population.
Fleet mice are a protected species of animals and it is illegal to kill them, to fall into trouble or to disrupt or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said: “We still have to learn a lot about our bats and many of our species simply don’t know how their populations are doing.
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers prepare to pursue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo justified allegations of assault as \"fake news\" and said that people \"will promote themselves\" by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly newspaper Der Spiegel, in which the accusations were published.
The peak of Portugal and Juventus is charged with the assault of an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of having paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, mentioned several hours after the allegations were reported, the reports \"fake news\".
No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news, says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
“They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the box.
I'm a happy man, and through and through - added the footballer to this, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a court case in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the charges they called “an unacceptable report of suspicions in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga, according to the report, returned to the footballer's room, where he raped her, according to the accusation, as read in the charge filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Maiorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a \"good guy\" for 99 percent, but that he is sometimes left behind that \"one percent.\"
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that this was with mutual approval.
Maiorga also claims that she went to the police and that there were photos taken of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed with an extrajudicial arrangement because she was “fearing for the consequences” and worried about the ‘public humiliation’.
The 34-year-old now says she wants to make the scheme invalid because she has been traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to head from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and this summer he left for the Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom \"will forever regret it\" as car producers leave
The UK will have \"ever regret\" if it loses its status as world leader in the field of car production after the Brexit, Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs, said.
He added that the “careful” thing was that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production in the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car producer said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit job would cost.
The Burnaston factory, where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My vision is that when Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also made their fears known about the consequences of an EU departure without an agreement for the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Oxford Mini Factory for a month after Brexit.
Most of the concerns the car producers face about risks in the supply chain in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line runs on the basis of the “just-in-time” principle, where every 37 minute parts arrive from UK suppliers and in the EU for cars made on order.
If, on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there can be a breach of the borders that, according to the industry, can lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota cannot store more than one day of stock in the factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped in that case.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is “exactly agreed to avoid those controls at the border.”
“We must have a deal. We want the best deal, which will enable us not only to continue the current success, but also to grasp this opportunity,” he told the audiences of BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must be able to go through this very successful set of supply chains —
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company’s competitiveness and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is a representative of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump and Rosenstein meet again can be delayed, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed “another week” while fighting over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and possibly hinders the president's justice.
The question of whether Trump will dismiss the Deputy Attorney General and thereby endanger Mueller's independence has been going on for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility to carry a microphone to hold talks with Trump and to depose the President via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors were made that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York City, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he wanted to dismiss Rosenstein's \"liver not\", but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing by the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both would testify.
On Friday, Trump gave the FBI orders a week's investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote in the entire Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump's press chief, appeared on Fox News.
Asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There is no date for this week, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for a week, given all other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll always like to keep the press up-
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not caused by a rejection of the “intentional” TV journalists, although she added: “I will not deny that they are trying to draw attention.”
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any president for him,” she said, without giving evidence: “We’ve looked at the figures.
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States questions directly, that’s definitely much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of that and you've often seen us do that over the past few weeks and that's going to take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or at press conferences with dictators who are visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated why, he made an open and at times bizarre appearance for the collected reporters.
Minister of Health writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and the desire that they continue to work at the NHS after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying for a fixed status for EU citizens working for the decentralized public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer the negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be made.
At the same time, the UK government has also raised preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know these uncertain times must be for all of you.
That is why I would like to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Collegas from across the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and provide benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is fixed and sure you are at home and we would like you to stay here -
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing a speed operation after head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers line-up, Christion Abercrombie, underwent a speed operation yesterday after he suffered a head injury in the 31-27 lost match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident took place shortly.
“He came to the sideline and swung up there more or less,” said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel immediately gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him to further research.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still no details about the type/size of the injury and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was picked up a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, which made him a total of 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher lows when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher lows when they buy a house in the UK and the income is used to help the homeless according to new plans of the Conservatives
This action will need to neutralize Corbyn’s success to attract young voters
The increase in the lows is raised to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher lows when they buy a house in the UK and use the extra income to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success that attracts young voters with promises to ensure more affordable homes and to tell this to many earners.
The increase in the lows is raised on persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, where the additional income is suspended in an effort by the government to fight homeless.
The charge, which comes on top of the current lows, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and houses purchased for rent, can amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year in this way.
An estimated 13 percent of London’s new building is purchased by people who do not live in the UK, which drives prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the home loader.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become virtually ‘spooking cities’ because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson pleaded for a reduction in the lows to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices high by buying up land and not using it, and he called on May to cut off quotas on affordable homes to restore the \"hospitality scandal\" in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rental ceilings and an end to “without negligence” exposure.
He also wants to give local governments more opportunities to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister in restoring the ‘British Dream’, which will make life better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be as simple for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy homes here if it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of ever owning a house has become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without having a roof over its head is all too real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, Sunderland's boss, says it's his \"entire ambition\" to ever become manager of Scotland.
The Scotland, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east of England, currently in third place in League One, at three points from the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning to the Scottish Premiership the previous season.
“As a footballer, I wanted to play for my fatherland.
But I was selected for the B-team and this was the choice off - Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“When I was a child, I saw my father playing in Hampden Park together with my father Scotland, and it’s something that keeps attracting me.
However, that possibility would only come if I were successful in managing a club -
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, before he had refused to have avages from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Succes for me is currently being measured by ‘can I let this club return to the Premier League?’
Due to the structure and facilities at this club, it is unlikely to be in the Premier League, he says.
“It’s not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful when I bring the club back there.
Ross is only three years in his career as manager, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from on the edge of degradation to winning the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably really a crossroads,” he remembered the moment he took the lead at Alloa.
“I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did the best I could, I earned quite well and have known a few reasonable highlights.
But football can be hard.
There are a lot of things that you are faced with weekly.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the subject, but management just feels good.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I’m real, I’m so good at my skin, as I’ve never felt in my adult life.

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, reveals research
The heat wave in the summer has raised income from British pubs that have difficulty surviving, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw sales rise by 2.7% in July, but the income in restaurants was 4.8% less, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Business Advisory Office, who collected the figures, said: “Consistent sunlight and the fact that England participated in the World Championships longer than expected, meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had 2.8 percent more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants were getting even harder now.
The 1.8% drop in the sales of restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on beverage sales were far from the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than those restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also aimed at the sale of food also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It seems that people just went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, alcohol sales were 6.6% higher per month, while food sales were 3 percent lower.
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the exit market.
It is no surprise, therefore, that restaurant groups continue to struggle, even though a 4.8 percent annual annual turnover is particularly painful given the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have arrived at a worse time for the food operators and will only be learning the time or giving the more moderate temperatures of August the necessary respite -
The total sales growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data are collected and analyzed from 47 operational groups, with a joint turnover of £9 billion. This is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children has a secret account for social media, which they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11 years old, has a secret account for social media, keeping them hidden from parents and teachers, revealing a survey
Among 20,000 high school students, aid revealed the growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a “head account” that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11 years old, make accounts for social media that keep them hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean “head account” that they show to their parents, while still having personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered there a teenager who asked others to \"rape her.\"
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters- and Headmistresses-conference) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and half admitted to holding personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are attracted to creating online spaces where they’re not found by their parents and teachers.
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 's voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics, as a non-executive director at the board's general annual meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the job and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the sports executives to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys much respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her election in the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can contribute and help run the sport in Scotland.
The American who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: “Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will teach me whether I will recover and to what extent.
It's been terrible hard work, but I'm now completely restored, I've learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises today!
Thank you for all the support -
Advertising for breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows, distributed online opinion
A company that makes breast-pumps has shared the online opinion with an ad in which sucking mothers are compared to cows that are milked.
To mark the introduction of what is called “the most silently portable breast pump in the world,” Elvie, consumer technology manufacturer, has released an ironic, music videos inspired ad to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to bulging mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics such as: “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see anything of it” and “In case you didn’t watch it, these are no onions, these are my breasts.”
The re-freezing then continues with: 'Pomps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the ladies'.
However, the ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has directly provided an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has attracted hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that the “horror” of the dairy industry is being maligned here.
“A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to be expected and ordered to produce milk, but in their case, the babies are taken away within a few days of the delivery - written in a reaction.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly into a nutrition bra (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else noted: “This is, of course, traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies -
Another added: “This ad is so far from reality.”
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted she found the song 'hilaric'.
“I think this is a genius idea.
I would buy one if I still breastfeeded.
That pump gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The ad is a bit weird, but I haven't been looking for too much.
This is a brilliant product, and someone wrote it.
Someone else had the following comment: “This is a funny ad, aimed at mothers who are bulls (often in the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel just like being ‘cow’.
This ad can't be positive or negative about the dairy industry at all -
At the end of the video you will see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their behas.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who bulls sometimes feel just cows.
The Elvie Pump, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or snakes and fits discreetly into a feeding vessel, so women have the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are on the bats.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says about this: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a strong and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between bulging mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to place the piston and its associated challenges in the spotlights and at the same time show in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will ensure an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time that Elvie’s pump is getting the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained immigrant children has reached a peak, even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and the harsh policies introduced by the Trump government make it more difficult to bring children under sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and they are afraid to risk their own chance to stay in the country by registering for a child.
That risk was increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and the other adult members of their households should hand their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Force, declared in a testimony to the convention that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have registered as sponsors for unguided minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of those who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal strangers.
We're going to follow these people,\" Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules, which required some of them to appear before the court within one month of the start of the detention, rather than within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the employees at the shelter.
Many of them will stand before the court through a video conference rather than in person, in order to advocate their application for legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are considered not eligible for help will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain trapped, the greater the chance of becoming anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or flight attempts, according to the staff at the shelter and according to reports released in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is struggling are ignored more often, due to the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare for this emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are struggling with.
Syria recommends the US, France and Turkey's 'occupation force' to withdraw immediately
In a speech for the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem has also called for the Syrian refugees to return, even now that the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also vice-president, said that the foreign troops were illegal on Syrian soil, under the prelude to fight terrorism and that \"this will be dealt with accordingly.\"
“They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he told the meeting.
According to Moualem, “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced and displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with “this sacred struggle until we have freed all Syrian territories from terrorist groups and from a “eventually illegal foreign presence”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly in the training and advice of the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favorable for their return and he is accusing 'some Western countries of spreading irrational fears' that keep most refugees away.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return,” he said.
\"They are politicizing a case that should only be a humanitarian problem -
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid is available for Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major bulwark of the rebels, has created the opportunity to launch political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has turned away a large-scale attack from Russia-backed Syrian troops in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, emphasized that this agreement knows \"clear deadlines\" and said he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front tied to Al-Qaeda, who would be \"cut off\".
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations Member of State, hopes to meet soon after the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for Syria after the war and open the way for elections.
Moualem made clear what the conditions of the Syrian government are to participate in the committee and said the work of the panel should limit itself \"to reviewing the articles of the present constitution\" and warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 elections unless, like many 'liberal' viewers probably hope, his presidency is delayed due to a decommissioning procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever.”
At the moment, however, there are no signs of sightlessness.
Since 2014, the viewing figures at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during \"prime-time\", compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC's \"The Rachel Madddow Show\" is at the top of the ratings for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers at evenings with important news.
“This is a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the responsible person behind the ABC drama ‘Designated Survivor’, a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has a different theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her that he was going to vote on Trump.
Why? She asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike all on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Turn off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond a well-informed citizen’s desire to be, when you see that you’ve been sitting for six hours looking at a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the “deep background” by Bob Woodward in his book ‘Fear’, who are talking about Paul Manafort’s jacket that cost $15,000 (“a garment full of pride” according to The Washington Post) and discussing the implications of the colorful description description by Stormy Daniels of Trump’s, Uh, anatomy.
I will never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“What he’s doing to give you the idea that it’s a reality show is partly that he’s giving you something new every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars”, about the rotating role distribution of the Trump show and the daily plot changes (a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praises).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you have the idea that you're running behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside to look at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not get rid of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh who had to appear before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember doing all those strange shows, not so long ago, and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right.

Money from outside flows into the most exciting interim elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees a flood of money, thanks to a re-re-creation of an electoral district that requires two sitting peoples to fight for the same seat.
The recently re-divided district of Pittsburgh meets Democratic People’s Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take it up against another sitting popular representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a lot to do with the new 17th district.
The cards were re-divided after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided ('gerrymandering') in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a knockout in the field of campaign funding between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a nipted victory in a well-reviewed special election for the 18th Pennsylvania constituency.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, Democrats have a small advantage.
The U.S. considers El Salvador to be punishing for support to China and has refused to do so
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners removed the Trump Organization’s management team.
United States Department of Foreign Affairs officials have decided to call back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama on the \"recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan,\" said Heather Nauert, the Ministry's spokesperson, in a statement earlier this month.
But punishments were imposed only in the case of El Salvador, as the country received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions to financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with a high unemployment rate and high murder rates.
As the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from leaving the United States.
But by mid-September, some top officials from the government said they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible criminal action against El Salvador impossible.
The plan is now that Vice President Mike Pence gives a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the government grants to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys have returned without further delay to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without harsh messages about Washington’s criminal action.
A White House spokesperson on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion under the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step may be the report by the special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counteracting of the justice by Trump, for which serious evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller is also likely to focus his research on the collaboration between Trump’s campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If the Congress of Color changes, Trump must take responsibility for that institution, just as he prepares to return to the electorate, and perhaps he should take responsibility for a jury in a court.
That's a lot of things, and I don't want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to execute a \"coup d'état\" against Hitler, but only if the West had opposed and Czechoslovakia had supported in Munich.
We failed and therefore missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the irresistible march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently faced with various of these kinds of bending points.
What will we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the moment this paper reported that he, last year, had suggested that he secretly recorded talks with the president and that he had speculated about the appropriateness of the president for his office.
Rosenstein says The Times' report is not correct.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s new applied investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will call Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will wait a very long winter.
But I believe we will not fail by the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived it, immigrated to America and sent me away, 60 years later, to light candles for the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika was depicted.
With that as my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Wien
Rangers are visiting Rapid Wien on Thursday and know that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive parable in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Through a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first game of the season until the 2-2 match at Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good eleven-year-old.”
“We went into the match with the idea that something to win fell and the match came out with a point.
Perhaps we could have even won at the end, but seeing the whole game is a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we got out in the second half we were the better team.
Next Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can score three points, but it’s going to be a difficult game because they also had a good result in their last match. But if the audience is behind us, I’m sure we can push through and we can achieve a positive result.
Last year has certainly been difficult, of all that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feldood factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can now push through, leave behind us the last season, and become successful again.
Women cannot sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of the way they want to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide survey said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People would like a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps necessary to make this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president for life insurance at Nationwide.
Let's start here.
Talk to your spouse(o)t(e) and the children: You can't prepare your family for care if you don't know your wishes well on time.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, because these choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Take a financial advisor in the arm: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term financing choices, among other things, may be a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or use your own assets as insurance, as long as you have money.
Set up your legal documents: Avoid legal battle when insurance needs to be used.
Make sure that you are a health care professional so that you can point out a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and make sure that the professionals keep up with your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider also a power for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure the invoices are paid if you can no longer do so yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Put these details into a written plan, so you have the information at hand.
“It’s not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors — asked Martin.
“What medicines are being used?
Who cares for the dog?
Make sure that the plan comes true.
Man shot several times with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun when he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, forty plus, was located in the Oxford Grove near Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was touched in his chest, belly and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a \"willful act.\"
The victim did not see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said officials, and the expectation is that the death toll will continue to rise.
Because the means of communication have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the rainy Donggala, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a power of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Celebes province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th birthday when the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a rainship that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The rainy region, just under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the Central Celebes province, particularly in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly hit by tsunamis over the past hundred years according to the Agency for the Control of the Disasters of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck in the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh on northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of it in Atjeh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 on the Richter scale took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that struck the south coast and claimed almost 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 on the Richter scale hit the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a power of 7.5 on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai Islands, off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed around 300 lives.
2016: An inconceivable earthquake struck the Pidie Regency in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the destructions of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami followed, but more than 100 people were found dead by collapsed buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, Alaska’s former governor and candidate for the vice-presidentship, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report of domestic violence and offering opposition during the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged arrests, he took off her phone.
Palin is held in prison in the house of conservation Mat-Su with a bailout of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday and declared himself “innocent, sure know” when he was asked this, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three class A violations, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B violation, which is punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is accused of criminal offence.
In December 2017, he was accused of mistreating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case now serves for Alaska's veteran court.
In January 2016, he was charged with abuse in the domestic atmosphere, interference in a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised in 2016 by a veteran group after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSS, which he would have held over to his service in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a power of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been shut down while the expectation is that the death toll will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are circular videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim a rare death sentence for suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, with eight people killed, a rare sentence not executed in this state since 1953.
According to the charge, Sajpov, 30, used a rented truck from Home Depot to launch an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he drove pedestrians and cyclists arriving on his road in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov has \"supposedly\" killed the eight victims and committed serious physical injuries, according to the intention statement in which the death penalty is demanded, which has been filed in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the charges of 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for the sake of a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as 'gracious, cruel and corrupt'.
Sajfoello Habiboellajevich Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been more than ten years since the Southern District of New York faced a case in which the death penalty was demanded.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being sentenced to espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not show any resentment in the days and months after the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He let the investigators know he felt good about his act, the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, the police told him.
He pleaded not to be guilty of the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he is “naturally disappointed” with the prosecutors’ decision.
“We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a debt confession in exchange for a lifetime sentence without the possibility of release, will only extend the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
The defense of Sajpov had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Member of Parliament says NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobilize a \"people's army\" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that the politicians should feel the “heat” of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s own parliament members suggested that he take the lead in the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants on the March in Birmingham that the UK would be 'he'd already been out' if Mr. Farage Brexit minister had been.
But the challenge for which May is put to the reconciliation of the highly divided ranks is stressed by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on the ride while this is attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Representatives held that it will continue and will try to close a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, thus forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and \"chaos\".
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to throw \"Chequers into the crow's basket.\"
He suggested that Farage should be knighted and that the responsibility for the Brussels negotiations should be met.
“If he was out of service, we would be out of it now,” Bone said.
The Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers into the rupee basket.”
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone has been making suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to remain in the EU is completely untrue —
The conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: “I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular to the general public, the opposition does not go for votes, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are elected.
Let Chequers fall and listen.
In a targeted message for May, she added: \"Premiers keep their jobs, when they keep their promises -
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the “hot” if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to say to them, ‘We don’t let you get away with this.’
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to let our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, set fire to the scenes.
We mobilize the People's Army of this country that has given us the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again.
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and ended this march with a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small group of activists swaaed with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood after the establishment of this group on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour High House, made jokes about the security issues of a Conservative party app at the beginning of their conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a full farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to “go well” about presidential candidacy
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “think well about her candidacy for the presidency” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts told her about her future at a meeting in a town hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican MP who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the center of speculations that she might be fighting with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
A present asked her if she would be elective to the presidency.
Warren replied that it’s time for women to go to Washington to recover our defective government and that includes a woman at the top.
arrest after killing Wayde Sims of LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told Saturday that a suspect was arrested after killing Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man who was seen in the movie.
Sims, 20, was shot down and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims got a shot wound in the head and died of its consequences,” police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot down by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and has been known to have been in the place criminally present, owned a firearm and shot down Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is imprisoned in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 metres who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches and started in 10 matches last season. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel gave him the victory after orders from team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost entirely in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits and let Hamilton drive in the group's tail, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes entered the pits a round later, and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on the head after a wheel-on-wheel action that required the Ferrari rider to release space on the inside after a double movement in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was a long-time leader of the race, because he stayed at his tyre choice and ran on fast finish so he could pick up Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Eventually he went to the pits in the 44th round, after which he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so that Raikkonen was fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did great his best all weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me.
The team has done its best for the places one and two,” Hamilton said.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday about her not being the source of Christine Blasey Ford’s selected letter, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly comment on the testimony given by Ford to the Senate’s Judicial Committee, rather he revealed that what took place in the Senate showed that people could be “common, unkind and untrue.”
“The only thing that can happen and the beautiful display that takes place in the Senate in the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and common and common and unkind and untrue,” he said.
“When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then say, ‘Oh, I haven’t done it.
I didn't do it.\"
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
You know her answer... you leaked the document--oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked.\"
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't leaked -- he added to this, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter in which the accusations were mentioned at the address of Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford and was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her desk was leaked.
“I haven’t kept Dr. Ford’s accusations hidden, I haven’t leaked her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to go with it confidentially and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked.
But the president turned out not to believe her denial, and he commented on it at the meeting on Saturday evening: “I’ll tell you what, that wasn’t a good body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Further, in defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power, with all necessary means.
You see the commonness, the unkindness, they don’t care about who they are hurting, who they need to drive to seize power and get back control — the president would have said, according to a report by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars has approved the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had taken the lead with two goals through scores by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team along before Dwyer led the Giants back.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen made his victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make a backlash on Friday evening to defeat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assist from Kendall McFaull, David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave the promotion for the equalizer of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants took a lead in the first rest when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team resumed and Bouchard brought them back to an equal stand with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the match, late in the second period. He led the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic driver dies while ensuring that hundreds of people can escape the earthquake in a plane
An air traffic driver in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people could safely rise on board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that has subsequently caused a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried under the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues were fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild-and-repeated traffic tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport.
He continued to ensure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was ready on the runway at the time, was able to rise safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower when he thought it was crashing.
He died later at the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News from Australia reported.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter had reached Palu.
“It breaks your heart when you hear it,” he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the death toll could rise to the thousandths and that the agency to combat the country’s disasters has limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“I believe that the death toll continues to rise because many bodies are under the rubble and have not yet been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the agency.
Waves that reached a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where Sunday a massive funeral will be held.
Military and commercial aircraft bring assistance and resources.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-archs are looted everywhere -
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race to help survivors, but we don’t know what to expect.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.
President Yoko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday, and he said to the present military: “I call on all of you to work day and night so that all tasks necessary for evacuation will be completed.
Are you ready for it - reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, leaving more than 550 people alive.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline carrying out the flight crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one more man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sunk plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger is missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the questions of more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew, after the plane had become too watery during landing at the airport of the Chuuk Islands.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that everyone’s condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what is the exact order of events remain unclear for a while.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane has been shot across the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane approached the airport very low.
“That’s good news,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes reported that he himself and some others managed to wade the water, which came to their means, to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewards were panicking and shouting and that he had a not serious head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that seamen who were in close proximity to work on a yard also helped with rescue operations by bringing people to the coast with an inflatable boat before the plane sank further in the about 30 meters deep water.
Aviation Safety Network data shows that in the last twenty years 111 people have been found dead in crashes of airlines registered with PNG, but that does not relate to Air Niugini.
Analist sets the timeline of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisitor on Friday in the reopening trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, filed a single-hour witness as a witness expert in information analysis.
He made clear to the jury how he had used the phone call data to capture the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she left her life.
Rowlett reported that he had received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which was in opposition to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood in the witness bench on Saturday and told him he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told him he was at Sanford in his truck that night, Sanford said he was \"a lie because my truck was then in Nashville.\"
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The mobile phone data indicated that they knew each other only one week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis knew the text messages, calls, and contact details of his phone.
“He knew her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense begins on Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expected the jury to begin the discussions later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hip hop'?
A hiphoptrio wants to discuss the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol states that hip hop is alienated from the origin of political opinions and the identification of social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hip hop' popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently had a revival in Britain by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
A child girl from New York challenges a couple to the judge because of a 'racist' text
A child girl from New York challenges a couple to the court because of resignation for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a wrongly sent text in which the mother complained about \"the black again.\"
The couple denies to be racist and calls the legal case \"impression.\"
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her abduction when she discovered that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, had turned out to be a Negroid woman when she met her on her first day of work in 2016.
\"NEVER WERE ZO'N ZWARTE,\" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the U.S. newspaper New York Post, the “uncompromising” feeling of the Plasco-Flaxman Mrs. Maurice when she realized her blunder, explained that their former baby girl, who was African-American, had done bad work, and that she had therefore expected a Filipino.
Mrs Maurice was paid for a day of work and was then sent home with a taxi.
Now Maurice challenges the couple for the court to get a fee of $350,-- per day for the 6 months for which she was hired to bivacate internally with the family, although without a contract.
“I want to make them feel like you just don’t,” Maurice said in the New York Post last Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple bet on the claim that she is racist by saying that it was reasonable to dismiss Maurice after they, by insulting her, were afraid that they could no longer trust her.
\"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
\"But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
I'm going to shoot it out.\"
“Comparing the case with “impression,” Plasco said his wife expected a baby in two months and was “in a very difficult situation.”
\"Are you going to pursue someone like that?
That’s not so sympathetic,” added the investment banker.
While the case is still running, public opinion is quick to capitalize the couple on social media, where they are cornered for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers feared that the public wouldn’t have much interest in a talking bear, revealing newly discovered letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's approval, said about the letter: \"It's hard to stand in the shoes of someone who first read it, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington's enormous success, it's very comfortable.\"
She told her father, who, before being inspired to write the children’s book about a small toy bear, when cameraman worked at the British broadcaster BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th birthday of the book’s publication felt ‘bitter sweet’ after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as “a very prominent member of the family,” she said that her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, \"He was a quiet, modest man.\"
“But because Paddington was so alive for him, it almost seemed like a child’s performance; you’re proud while you haven’t done anything for yourself.
I think he experienced Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear for its success.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her by phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life.
“Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that they were expected to get it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
\"Then Nad's phone came to say that she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, 'Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be back soon.
Then I'll be back with you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly turned out and left her body.
She died some time before, and this process turned everything off.
I could just sit there, knowing what was all going on.
I couldn't cry, cry or cry, because I was in the middle of all kinds of people and families.
I really had to keep myself big.\"
In the end, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the death of her daughter, stepped into the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what to endure.
“No one knew,” she said.
\"I sat down with my head, and the tears were coming.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.\"
Routing women places messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have been lost by suicide make a strong effort to keep others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call people in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want anyone older to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney in the English county of Gloucestershire, reports that her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.
\"He was known for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit every room.”
Yet he stopped working for his death because he was deep in the well.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself of life.
Mrs Davis said, “I am constantly worried that there will be a chain response.”
Mrs. Davis has made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and what you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't keep silent - talk about it.\"
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
\"He didn't say he felt tired or depressed or something like that,\" she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was on the ground on First Christmas — when the children took out their gifts, he didn’t look at them at all.”
She said that her death was a great trauma for her, but that they should process it: “It's tearing the whole family apart.
It drives us apart.
But we all have to continue and keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain while FBI launches investigation
\"I thought that if we could really get what he asks for for each other; an investigation limited in time and size, we might be able to create more unity again,\" said Mr Flake last Saturday, to which he added, fearing that the committee was falling apart, in the midst of a firmly anchored patch within the party.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their stubbornness has everything to do with timing.
The interim elections have been over five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as expected, Republicans do bad, their attempts to get their husband elected to the highest court in the country are seriously interfered.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus met his wife Ashley, who was the Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has finished the report?
There is a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, Vice President, to issue the determining vote to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Number of overlaprs in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislature, the number of North Korean overruns to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, which quotes from data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, explains that last year there were 1,127 runners, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human smuggling, are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded publicly.
The vast majority of North Korea's overcrowds are eventually offered South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the flights through China, which has the longest outer border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily secured demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarianized Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the offenders to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often resorts to violence.
The relations between North and South, which are still formally capable of war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, particularly talking about the stagnant negotiations on nuclearization.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed to work towards the nuclear dismantling of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the U.S. of lack of progress in lifting US sanctions since then.
“Without faith in U.S. action, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under those circumstances there is no first step of untwined disarmament,” Mr. Ri said during a speech for the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh \"hysterical\", and finds him unqualified to serve in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, named candidate judge before the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him unqualified to serve in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
\"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved like that, one would call her 'hysterical',\" Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee for Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he would have sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes cried almost and was mainly from the region when he told about his family and his high school time.
He also expressly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him “great and confidential character murder” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she found that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not qualified to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and by the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats,” Pelosi said.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to set up an impeachment trial against Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the Democrats would receive the majority in the House of Representatives.
\"I can say this about it; if he does not tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, then he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he now serves,\" Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Justice of the District of Columbia (usually abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would speak out against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (Affordable Health Care Act). Kavanaugh is known as a Conservative judge.
Kavanaugh asked questions about the review of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
“Don’t expect us to be glad if a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed to the Supreme Court,” Pelosi said.
Women just have to admit to this.
It is a just tirade of months and years of anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
“We’re going to cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s weird, you?”
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was some kind of leader and who told me that she was going to cry when she got angry. She developed a method of always crying when she got angry. Against the one she spoke to, she said, “You might think I’m sad because I cry.
I'm angry.\"
And then she just cried further.
I just found it brilliant.\"
Trans are sometimes permitted as expressions of anger, because tears are essentially unreceptive.
One of my best remaining memories from an early job, in a man-dominated office, is when I had to cry horrendously because I was very angry. An older woman, a sick business manager who was a little scared of me, grabbed me in my neck and pulled me into a stairs.
\"Never show them that you're crying,\" she told me.
\"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and are glad they got you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was embroiled in an external affair aboard a boat called \"Monkey Business\" (informally meaning \"cat\" or \"appointments\") and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not be a candidate.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later, laughing.
There were already 7 other candidates in the race, and the last they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarves'.
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was left behind with fund recruitment, so she vowed not to join if she could not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give to men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
\"Do they think I'm getting discounts?\" she asked herself.
When she gave her speech in which she announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach voters instead of colleagues, and of anger over sexism - that she put into it.
“I’ll think I’d get a nerve suspension,” Ms. Schroeder reminded me of how the media responded to her.
\"They'll think Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they put on my gravestone?
“She was crying?”
How the trade war between the United States and China can take advantage of Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the U.S. and China were overdone, and although the fight has not been fought for a long time, a gap between the two countries, according to long-term experts, would be able to take advantage of Beijing.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, gave the first warning earlier this year by increasing taxes on major Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation became known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (150 billion) of goods; half of all goods that come from China the US.
Beijing has been reprised every time, most recently by increasing rates from 5 to 10% for $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to equalize the U.S. every time, and the world’s after-largest economy is probably not going to cut its eyes fast.
In order to bend Washington, requests must be granted, but public bending for the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays smart, the trade war with the U.S. could support China in the longer term, as the mutual dependence on the two economies decreases.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could lead one of both countries into an economic free fall is actually much more dangerous than spectators have previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, a research employee of the Center for a New American Security, a think tank specializing in national security issues, focusing on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, said Foreign Minister
Syria says to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by a more than seven years of war.
During his speech for the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that conditions in his country improve.
“Today, the situation on the site is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in fighting terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have to leave because of terrorism and the one-sided economic measures that threatened their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are still about six million people in the country who need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in restoring the devastated land.
However, he emphasized that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the Le Golf National golf course southwest of Paris in France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of Danish leader Thomas Bjorn achieved the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was struggling for almost the entire tournament, allowed his long beat from the tea to get into the water at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shrunk in all of his rounds and became one of the four players who had ever achieved 5-0-0 since the tournament began in his current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the lowest scorer of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes to play.
The highest-class player on the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play by Ian Poulter from Britain, who may have played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
\"I don't cry so soon, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help,\" said an emotional Garcia after European victory.
He passes the box to his countryman, John Ram, who defeated the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
\"The huge pride I feel because I have defeated Tiger Woods, and I've always followed that guy when I grew up,\" said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the greatest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played at high level throughout the tournament.
U.S. leader Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, \"I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
A short time this morning, we have made Europe a bit more difficult.
We faced opposition.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup ourselves. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking ahead.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their leader.
You have to take off your hat for the opponent.
We're overplayed.\"
