No liberating novels for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the request to abolish the paragraphs under a novel of the Criminal Code on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was convicted.
The new regime, which could have taken the way to free the imprisoned Prime Minister, rejected the Members in the second reading of the application for mildening of the penalties for economic offences.
In October Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for entering into an alleged disadvantage contract with Russia over the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet legal, in December the appeal of the convicts is to be negotiated before the court.
Timoshenko himself referred to the judgment as a political revenge of the regime and even in the West, the trial led to the suspicion of the court’s propriety.
The application, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was sentenced to remove from the Criminal Code was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of Libyan liberation campaign or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As it is usual for this region to win in the elections of Islamists, the question is only which - the moderate or radical.
The National Transition Council was known for the right of habit of Sharī’a, from which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for theft, you’re short-lived.
Women should also forget about Emancipation as soon as possible, possible faith-abortioners are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Qur’an in the future.
In short - in Libya an order will prevail, which would hardly be imaginable and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans.
So it is rather alarming that the Muslim fighters were able to help themselves by the faithless dogs.
Its apologies may only serve the fact that NATO's air attacks were led not by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose all-power was praised after every successful encounter.
The winners in Libya? The West is not part of it.
We only took part in a change of shooting, served the interests of Islam and our politicians detained themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without having made any advantage of it.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we prefer to see a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the heretics are a concern - namely the displacement of the cruisers.
But do the mineral oil companies also get the black gold at the spot price without occupation?
It is hardly possible, at last, for the West to boast in the right of its selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If this does not destroy the Sharī’a representatives.
Start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe focus on investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm broke through Europe.
The individual states published their information on their GDP for the 3rd quarter.
The Czech economy has grown in comparison with the prequarters, Germany and France.
The bond market is breaking all records today.
The investors not only keep a close eye on Greece, but also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European Zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by 0.5%, which by 0.4% from France.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded higher growth than was originally expected (growing by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France had a slight decline by 0.1% (original information only spoke of Stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, the gross domestic product stagnated and according to the Csch. Statistical Office confirmed the trend in the growth slowing up of economic performance.
So the results are worse than the predictions of analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this third quarter compared to the previous year, but compared to the previous quarter, it stagnated.
According to preliminary and seasonal reports, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Throughout the eurozone and the EU, the economy recorded a 0.2% growth between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy was shrinking by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The return from their 10-year state bonds rose to 28.45%.
The return of the Italian and Spanish state bonds rose to its critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The return on Czech State bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region has deteriorated.
In Germany, votes are being made that the Committee will become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
Football selection has championed the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-established goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent gate by Petr Jiráček, she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will not be missing again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz pursued the rise game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech selection also won thanks to the completion of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro quite happy 1:0 and has thus released their ticket for the football EM.
Also, because of the exact defense game of the Czech team, they put the Montenegriners under greater pressure in the second half.
The Pechbirds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, Czech selection will therefore be mixed with the European Championships next year, and it is also delighted that domestic football will bring a prize of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes of football, it was played quite violently.
Both teams combined slowly and so was played primarily around the middle line.
Even in the second half, the pressure of the home team remained, and the far-offs in front of the penalty room were successfully resisted by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundreds of university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object on Tuesday afternoon and then proclaimed death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Isfahan formed a living shield around the core technology center in Isfahan, in which uranium is processed on Tuesday.
So they wanted to know that they were willing to protect the core program of their country, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has not given up all its efforts for a nuclear weapon for a long time.
Israel also talks about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students had prayed to the complex on lunch before the entrance, and then announced the death of the United States and Israel.
In the event of a deliberate attack on the Iranian nuclear program, according to the Israeli press from the center in Isfahan, the nuclear power plant in Natan’s attack target would also be paralyzed.
The menu of a fatty child: It doesn't breakfast and eats to the evening bread sausage
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Current polls proved - adipous children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
Once again, how important it is for a person’s healthy development to be the environment in which he grows up and are the examples that surround him.
On the tables of adipous children, sausages are up to half more common on the table than in families where normally weighty children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had on the eve of the education action under the motto “Adipistas is not a coincidence - pommes to the evening bread.
In families with Dickerchen, sport is also not just among the favorite players, but also the majority of today's students - only 15 percent responded that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year by the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children being surveyed from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action “Adipistas is not a coincidence” supported by the General Hospital and Society Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the frighteningly increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
“Only half of the surveyed children, for example, started eating breakfast-second breakfast lunch-vesper evening bread five times a day, one of the main requirements for a healthy diet,” said one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner bread
Experts point out that even relative smallties, such as the family’s regular breakfast period, are important for a child’s healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students’ families were born.
And - in most families, everyone has breakfast for themselves.
The worst thing was the fact that in every 10th family there is no breakfast.
Breakfast is considered the foundation of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test, among other things, brought on the day that in the families of overweight children, one consumes much more often unhealthy pommels.
And almost everyone, without regard to weight, drinks sweet lemonades (70 percent) every day.
Although more than 40 percent of children surveyed drive sports, only less than half of their parents do so - just 15 percent.
Together your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to put together their own food plan from offered options according to appetite and opinion.
“What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in puncto diet is far from the ideal for healthy diet.
Among their favorite foods were many meats, meat dishes and, of course, sweet foods.
“Alarming is especially the great popularity of sweet lemonades,” the final report on this survey stressed.
At lunchtime, i.e., the main court, teaware just won in front of poultry.
The children almost did not like the chickens and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get proper information.
“In the group of survey participants who filled out the questionnaire following the conclusion of the lecture ‘Adiposta is no coincidence’, in many cases a significant shift in preferences to healthy nutrition principles has been indicated in the results of the project.
This was obvious, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give ordinary water priority.
The children also crossed in the questionnaire many more frequent poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were willing to eat less garlic or sweet foods.
Pros claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introduction article on how stylists learn, I had a bit of evidence that this was a bit too much substance for the beginning.
I didn't know what was coming.
Talks from three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar about how it runs “in the square.”
It's gonna be even worse.
The closer the examination takes, more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still full of evidence.
This time we discussed with director Alena (on the course no man takes part) how to attract a woman who has no ideal rationed figure.
And that’s what most of us are.
The one has one too short neck, the other one too youthful figure without proper curves and the other is obnoxious.
It is a matter of stylisting wide shoulders optically, extending the neck, or enchanting the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a female type like Jennifer Lopez - i.e. with large buses, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-betont, without being all too proactive.
For example, if the difference between waist and hip is so large that the rock or pants really do not fit, you should be able to cut at least one piece to measure.
You will certainly not regret this, because good sitting clothes are simply unpaid.
In such a custom-made rock, one feels much better than in one of the rod, which is always too high and suffocated, in the waist, etc.
Younger figures can, in turn, be allowed to wear clothing with folds, constructions, applications, stickers or trapping.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am happy that I have a whole week of time to let myself go through everything thoroughly.
And yet, I am afraid that it is almost impossible to do so in the face of the imposed housework.
Each of the students was assigned a promi for which they should think about suitable outfits - day-to-day clothing and evening robberies.
We should consider the current appearance, fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure.
I want to \"dress Miranda Kerr\" who might know you from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the interior I rejoice, because that’s personally much better for me than attracting Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to the hundred kilos in recent times (after all, that’s a bit of exaggeration), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We want to cut the clothes out of magazines or search the internet, print them, and then edit them graphically.
In the ‘Moodboard’ as the whole result is called, then our very personal style and our relationship with graphic design are to be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific requirements, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture filled with information about figure types was echoed by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion illusion is and that it should be a stylist able to take advantage of it.
And a skilled stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in a very different way.
The magic word is Variability.
For example, one can wear a trench coat as usual over the jeans, so like a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear sales shoes and wear it as clothes.
It is enough to screech the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks quite different.
“Bet with it,” he stressed.
Most of the time, however, I found the following advice: “First you need to know the rules perfectly.”
“First you can hurt them,” Jakub said.
Finally, I will understand why we need to pauk all these lessons, what can be combined with what, and why, even if you get to see something very different in fashion journals often.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (say ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories looks quite different from in reality.
So you have to expect all of this in the design of the outfit.
That image and style make up half of the success, and that also confirmed to us Jan Pokorný.
You just need Madonna to look at a not just brilliant singer who made a world star from the image and marketing.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Also well-known individuals often think this is for thrown-out money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look at it is secondary).
And if someone can be styled by us, then we should expect that he or she will likely force us a completely different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google to ensure that the Boulevard Press writes, the corresponding Promi has returned to or declined, etc.
Jan and Mario put us to the heart on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist only focuses on fashion and then needs the outfit to build together.
In his work, he must communicate primarily with the people he styles and he must be a weary psychologist.
Appreciate people without offering themselves and standing in his opinion.
“If any manager orders us to see their wardrobe and to supplement beautiful pieces, then we can’t clean it out the whole cabinet and say, “My God, that’s terrible.”
“You have to find at least a few precious things to recommend what you can do to it,” Mario says.
He also showed us very specifically what must include a so-called ‘place bag’.
So such a bag, which is buttoned on the waist and in which one carries all the necessary proprieties.
In addition to such clear things as shaves, unrollers for hair removal or safety needles, they also contain such utensils as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the back of the garment is touched, if it is too large (stick needles or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric does not crack) and, of course, needles.
But in order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to keep shoes under control.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, one can damage the shoe sole, sweating the outside.
We glued and glued...
With the shear, you should not even touch the shoes so that you do not damage them.
So you really have to do it.
Mario pleased me by praising my “creation” without restrictions.
The above-mentioned skill is not just my strength.
All of this was only the fraction of what we got at the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me since then - to dedicate yourself to styling at a professional level, is not a children's game.
V Need for Speed: \"The Run\" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree ride will be completely avoided by a series of dilettant errors to routine driving to the early layer.
While it is possible to fulfill the ambitions in a large way, what benefits if no one obviously wanted to do a bit more.
Even before he came to the store table, the new part with the subtitle “The Run” awakened high expectations.
He promised to move again a piece into a new dimension the already-defunct game series Need for Speed, and in the playable demonstration examples, he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the fitted passes fall out, where the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as is already common with NFS, in the end it is much different than you expected.
Sure - it is potentially quite decent arcade racing, but overall, the game is crushed by some superfluous errors that are more or less present in this series for a few years.
So it's actually no longer mistakes, but rather signs of an incomprehensible failure of game developers in principle.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, one will be introduced to history, whose main character, Jack, has certain personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, that is, on the west coast, you put yourself on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and into more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is carried out on other routes and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don’t have a moment to think that game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments still have to look very carefully at this, although the technical level of graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing world moving.
But the journey through the desert, through autumny landscape or high above by deep snowy landscape works visually very pleasant.
Time and again, untypical elements bring a little difference into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm, which severely restricts sight.
In the mountains, in turn, it is necessary to take care not to be shaken by an avalanche.
In addition, the individual races are built up quite well together.
Only a few, but they are rich.
For a while one tries to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then one has time to pick up (classical race against the stop watch), then one expects another personal duell with a single opponent.
And that is why the police are getting involved in the whole thing.
A novelty is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It’s more about certain interactive animations where Jack flies in front of someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that in the game, there are far less of such passages than you would expect (in concrete only three).
In the end, this is more of an advantage, because this element has at least no chance of becoming boring - it is one of the elements that make the game more varied in context.
The driving model goes into the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today's point of view, it doesn't tear out trees, on the other hand, one could not claim it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you need to look around elsewhere.
But an action-packed racing will continue to be very well-suited to the driving model, even though you can find better at the competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems only arise after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not entirely O.K.
From a game of this kind, it is hardly expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no impact on any object knowing how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is all right.
Typical example: When you are in close contact with the opposite cars, you can only easily get into the other cars at some point, in other, almost identical situations, and turn wild pirousets.
Or drive the car right away.
Thanks to the restart system, this doesn’t matter any further, since it’s all annoying.
The restarts are solved in this way: if you have total damage or land far off the route, then one throws the game back to the last reference point of the route.
Only - in every race you have only five restarts.
If you have exhausted them, everything goes from the front to the front.
So the restarts are more like a tool than a tool, in case something fails, but you should rather not leave it.
Sometimes, however, it doesn’t even help the restart, because nothing else helps you learn from the critical section.
It is extremely unpleasant that the same things often happen at the same places.
For example, some curves need to be passed through in a very specific way, or you simply don’t fit through.
Otherwise, at the appropriate place, there are always cars in the same configuration, whether you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the contrahent passes past a playful two opposite cars, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to get around or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you arrive there, everything is designed so that it’s always close to your nose to this situation.
The counters have other advantages.
Throughout the game, there are a few places where you are always picked up by the same opponent at the same place and again here without consideration for the time.
At the wrong time, this is for the end of the game on the long bridge that you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent has to get one out of here obviously on the devil.
And if he's before one, he's obviously taking a look, so that you'll get your own car there a couple of times.
Clearly - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly avoids the joy of the game.
And that's harmful, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and, in a way, also so action-laden that you almost don't know where one's head is.
And in principle, no matter what is “guilty” on it, the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no bored can come up, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the car change over the course of the races.
You should not overlook the gas stations on the route, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car is enough that you just have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the Serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game story also goes the task mode ( Challenges) - i.e. the races in the individual localities you know from history.
Here there are not only medals but also experience points for your own profile that are together for the tasks ( Challenges) and history.
In order to reach the higher driver level, different items must be unlocked: starting from the car, up to the backgrounds for the profile.
At the same time, this is connected to the autolog online function, which compares the results that other players have achieved with, among other things, and also ensures other collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible snipers is a situation in the last race of history.
This is where you get to a subway tunnel in the dark on the rails for a long time.
On the Tacho look at numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (meaningway), but there comes a subway at once from the rear and rides uncompromisingly.
In our editorial, we will probably have a long-term dispute as to whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors would think us so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
The most frustrating thing is that at some exciting moments the image repeat frequency is getting slower and this, among other things, is quite dramatic.
This, however, relates in particular to the accidents with greater number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not use anything anyway.
The sound display is to the extent O.K. and the soundtrack is taste.
In an effort to address an as broad as possible scale as young audiences, a soundtrack a lá was created by everyone - but who buys such a game already because of the music?
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game did not melt through the above-mentioned completely unnecessary errors, we could have claimed with the breasttone of the conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game works somehow.
A class of fun for yourself, but you should be prepared for someone to face this mistake with the power of airport lights.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Euroskeptics
“The Lisbon Treaty has brought balance from the lot to the individual institutions,
I wouldn't have expected such a hard war to be raging.\"
“It will take five, six years for the waves to shine and all of them to become accustomed to their new role — Milena Vicenová, the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, began to give a very strong talk at the Faculty of Law.
How seriously she takes the motto “intellectual and open about Europe,” she showed in the first part of her talk that she managed to describe the individual EU bodies and their mutual relationships in such a way that she could have been so enamored by some lecturers of the Faculty of Law of Karls University.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
“In the beginning, criticism became that he was too unobtrusive — a grey official who didn’t grow such a role, but I have to say that it all wasted the breath, how good he accepted the matter.
\"He's a person who's ready to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, communicate with them, and who has particularly clear ideas about how to continue with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it as an answer to the question: Who really is that — the European Union? What number should I call — that is, as an important step toward agreement and better readability of EU policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our oil potter Quargel
Mrs Vicenová also dedicated herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived, lives and remembers to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago described it as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also held the Eastern Partnership summit.
The case of the government during the presidency referred to it as a major negative, which greatly damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic’s representation in the EU is currently full of hands.
In the words of the ambassador, it was not only during the presidency, but also during the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, quite hectic.
And the seven-year budget of the EU has yet to be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and efficient budget, which will be given priority in the economy, which countries are more and less funded - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also reminded her of her own slogans, which she came to Brussels: “Conscious of Europe”
“If I don’t like anything, then it’s horrible shorts, foreign words, and professional marijuana that no one understands.
How should I, as a citizen, know whether we are really crumbs or round rugs in Brussels and think of various large bananas or whether we really want to ban anyone from the quarries?
It would also like to use the soil of the EU to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are in a position to be Euroskeptics who perceive more the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The most annoying is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
That is why many factors are at fault, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, which is known as V4.
“Believe me when a pole or a Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, the French say next to me: “He what you put together there is the heads - that’s your V4 again, and that makes a pretty sour mine.
According to Mrs Vicenové, in the future, the EU is expecting, above all, hard rules for the budget policies of the Member States.
As much real as a European Federation, it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have the countries of the eurozone and the countries off the eurozone.
“We have the OER Area and we already have the Institute of Strengthened Cooperation,” he said.
“For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want to work together and those that don’t want it should stand still.”
“There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately expects a strong Europe of different speeds.
In this respect, she also respected the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle that all issues must be supported by all Member States and not just by the eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
The Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for an appropriate word that most accurately characterizes IBM’s strategy, this would probably be the word “long-suffering”
IBM is the synonym of the technological revolution for the broad public, and it is known as a modern company, although a century has passed since its foundation.
The basis for this permanence was laid by her first boss - visionary Thomas J. Watson.
He has already seen the slogan that countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a bit.
His slogan “Think” became a trademark for playing the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company’s journal, which was started to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the well-prepared corporate culture prepared by Watsen.
“For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not hesitate to change everything else.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society over the course of our first century.
We hope that we will create even more over the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
A Sanitated System
Watson has been operating social care for his employees over the past thirty years - similar to that of the entrepreneur Baéna in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had paid vacations as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a well-thought-out payment system for the best new and dealer.
Likewise, IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are very exciting.
From the beginning, the company was brilliant in talent promotion - as one of the first companies in the world to raise IBM any discrimination - and could therefore choose.
In line with this anti-discriminatory strategy, the current plan is also to switch the Palmisan at the top of IBM next year from a woman to Virginia Rometty.
This has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she has taken the position of head of the driving, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings in recent years, with many future strategies and innovations growing.
No wonder - ideas exist enough, in the company, almost half a million people are busy.
An institution with a good reputation
Your unshakable position in business guarantees the company a strong image and this within and outside.
“From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company,” said economist, professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies,” added George Colony of Consulting-Studio Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be present on the market only or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM, in the states of its logo, called \"Big Blue\", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns most patents and already five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
Its most well-known inventions include bank machines, credit cards, financial swap, strike code or also the disk.
With approximately $220 billion of stock exchange value (market capitalization), IBM was the second largest technology company (equivalent to Apple) this year, with Microsoft taking over for the first time since 1996.
The view ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unhappy were, for example, the attempt with their own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or also the computer IBM PC Jr.
“Business is based on the forward movement, so you cannot emotionally bind to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM has no problem building its basic walls on various platforms - and if they don’t work to leave them again.
In contrast to Microsoft, which is in principle with its operating system Windows and falls.
Successfully Promiseing Technologies
IBM’s profits are largely involved in services, software and hardware, each of which participates in a fifth.
In 1990, hardware with a more than fifty percent share was the strongest represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profits of $15 billion, but at the same time it invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-oriented technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the new financial crisis fought for the first time as a storm over the world.
Here, too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the midst of the great global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM has survived the present crisis unharmed.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008 and the company’s clean-up profit continues to grow.
IBM’s company logo is: everything can be changed - only the values can’t be changed.
This is why it should be expected that this flexible giant also masters the next crisis.
IBM History: From cheese cutler to world all-wings
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded in New York a hundred years ago had a fairly complicated name at first - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM only took it in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone to the later society of IBM laid the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 80s of the 19th century.
They have technologies such as the famous Stech Card watches to register the beginning and end of work.
The architect of this new company became Charles Ranlett Flint, who also had the presidency in the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who appointed the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
This leader then even put IBM's founders in the shadow - on Watson's ideas, to this day, the company's invincible culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name has already been betrayed, began the production and distribution of all possible machines for trade - from sausage and cheese cuters, to cash.
During the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled their turnovers to $9 million and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so essential to the company that he sat in the chair for forty years, only then was dismissed by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 60s, NASA’s technicians and computers helped direct flights to all of them - to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight of humans to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that defined the computer standard of that time came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but, on the other hand, it bought the consulting part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and fully entered the business with high value consulting services and services.
The strategy that IBM has paid off over the last three years is the concept of the Smart Planet.
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned to date, e.g. to improve the situation in traffic and urban administration.
In the trade sector, IBM recently launched the Smarter Commerce platform, which is intended to help traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932, IBM founded a branch in Czechoslovakia, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic Outsourcing Center in Brünn.
The centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and here is also a world-level top research team dealing with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rychtářová over her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - this donkey you can keep, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her husband, Josef Rychtář (53), became their lover from the guardian of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina remained hopeful that Joseph would wake up from his pink-red dream and come home.
But now it is definitely over with patience and for the next life she has set clear rules.
“Josef can come home, but no more than my partner,” explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová had offered refuge to the singer I. Bartošová in her own house, she would probably not have even fallen into the dream of how that goes with her husband.
When Iveta went back on her push after 30 days and returned to Şíčany, Joseph went with her.
Yes, he knew publicly that he loved her.
In time, Darina, even though she seemed to want to reconcile herself with her unfaithful husband again, finally gave him the pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with.
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
“He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I will not chase him out.”
“No matter what, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain ties, Mrs. Rychtářová, she also said, she has already been emotionally separated from him and is alone in mutual presence.
The fact that Darina locked the back door on him, Joseph so far wears with dignity.
\"I respect my wife's decision,
“I stay with Iveta, nothing changes.”
“My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect it.”
“The company continues to run, I care about the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases.”
“With Darina, I’m quite normal, but we just don’t share the bed,” said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, then she doesn’t want to stop it.
“We don’t sleep with each other, so I don’t know if she has a friend or who that is.
It is clear to me that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I take over any responsibility.
The worst female intangibles: What about you?
If you ask the men to call some typical female indecents, then they immediately shake some out of the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself again in the following lines in which we let some unseat situations happen again, which allow men to want the blood in the veins?
Shop Search
Do you think that your father would like to be a shopkeeper?
Do you need to buy at least one Hader weekly?
Do you like to go shopping and may it be a bit more in the event of actions?
In your case, it’s probably a weakness.
Some women are aware of it at least and try to keep their shopping desire under control.
But hand to heart, which woman does it already matter to bumble in search of a well-sitting upper garment only by a clothes shop and not to try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
How many times have you told your husband? - You'd love to stay out of here.
Persistent Inevitability
“I am not too thick.”
\"I had to take at least five kilos - I should start jogging or making gymnastics.\"
\"I like you at all.\"
Is this something known to them?
Yes?
You may also be among the women who are regularly possessed by what they look like.
That long does not mean you should let yourself go, but many men react allergically to it when their wife is constantly sorry about her appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly unbearable.
First of all, order and cleanliness
It is a battle against the windmills.
Put windows, wipe garlic and dust, shake the well - and this at least twice a week.
Wearing with her partner because he’s once again trampling on the clean furniture with dirty shoes, you shake the children, because the newly grounded washbasin is already dirty again and because the glass door at the living room has already had fingerprints, but where does the pooling make so much effort?
If you suffer from this kind of “deviance,” then you should know that you can’t exaggerate anything and that the order and cleanliness in family life are not the first thing in your life.
This immeasurable purity figure can ultimately also damage one another’s relationships and, above all, peace in the family.
Stickelen
“Smooth turnhos come into the laundry basket”
“Will you really wear the old socks tomorrow?”
“A wet towel is not simply thrown on the floor.
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that he brings it to the palm.
Clearly, this is not a bad idea, but they just want everything to have its order.
If the men knew this, then women might not need to eat so much.
Klatsch and Tratsch
Some women like to clumsy and meet, as they are intertwined or even slandered behind the back, or they make bad alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to raise such issues as, for example, who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, each of us women has a bit of harmless clattering and Tratsch in stock.
Hand on the heart - that's probably all women's own.
However, this is not to be confused with clasts of roughest calibers, who are nothing and no one sacred, who certainly despises everyone in their environment and who, particularly for women’s collectives, pose a significant danger.
Jágr and Voráček help Philadelphia with their assists to win
The ice hockey tower Jaromír Jágr had a large share of Philadelphia’s 5-3 victory on the Carolina ice at the NHL’s Monday game with two assists and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases Claude Giroux, who added an assist and was called the best player of the match, was a user of the overview of the nine-and-a-half-year-old ice hockey star.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jágr told the journalist that he had a big evening prophesy.
“I tell him before the game that today he has a hat trick.”
I felt that way somehow.
“In and out of such a feeling,” Jágr said, according to Giroux’s action, when the first shot of the Flyers reached a goal.
A little later, the second hit was also \"a Czech track\".
Voráček fought behind the gate of Hurricanes the Puck and presented it to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles.
A second before receiving the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer achieved a short-hander, but the second third then again belonged to the Flyers.
Concrete Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he reached his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds pulled his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league, but he’s definitely one of the best three,” Jágr said.
“I wouldn’t have been in my life to play with such an ice hockey player as with him at the conclusion of my career.
“That’s great,” he said.
“I cut my game on me.”
“All the years in the NHL my co-players put their game on me and now the spear turns around,” Jágr smiled.
Carolina made the game another drama - through the hit of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who was out of a penalty committee, got on a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complications in which he was in excess of two against a successful one.
\"Excellent Pronger still acted in our zone\"
“He broke the puck, I picked up the ride and (read) pulled to distant pads.
“I tried to meet him and am happy that he succeeded,” Voráček described the last hit of the match from his point of view.
This victory put Philadelphia at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defence player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the game against Buffalo and kicked out in the second third because of an injury on the upper body.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candiens also made their lead an unbeaten in the Penalty shooting 2:3.
One of the criminal committees was unable to transform Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points, the home team's coach may have been pained by the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game ended only with five defense players.
“That’s bad”
“We only played the meeting with a single experienced player, the rest of whom were young players.
“But nothing can be done, so we have to be done,” Jacques Martin said.
“At each change one attack wave after the other and we had nothing to do with it.”
“We had to make the game easier and bring the puck out of our third.”
There were reserves here - meant P. K. Subban, one of the defense players.
The Czech gatekeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
By 1989 there were only five state travel agencies in the then ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recreation and Autoturist.
At that time, the travel agencies sold mainly trips to the socialist East Block countries, and in the West, only electors were allowed at that time.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Peninsula Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-western course and therefore the journey to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed to travel freely in the context of socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he would need a so-called letter of invitation, otherwise individual trips would not be possible.
At that time, the travel offices also offered trips to the west, but then they had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag before the travel office, or at least have \"good acquaintances\" in the travel office.
So, too, the matter had not been running for a long time.
The so-called currency commitment - the condition for a trip to the West - was granted only “politically reliable” people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a free exchange currency, so it would have been impossible to drive up the necessary funds (western currency) for a trip to the West.
The majority of the Czechs therefore spent their holiday in the interior, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and daches - a habit that persists to this day.
The 1989 revolution followed a revolution of the Czechs on foot.
While by 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holiday abroad in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox of which you are no longer aware of today is the fact that you could not travel to the most popular holiday country in the Czech Republic until 1989 because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
From the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the obligation of foreign exchange was lifted to neighboring Western European countries, resulting in a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians could not get enough of their journeys to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
For example, when traveling to Paris in the tent in the park, the Czech holidayers slept, because who would have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or a pension at the time.
A typical feature of Czech foreign travel was a bag room then filled with containers, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely interchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the western currency freely.
Our level of life and this also increased the average wager, which ended in a further important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began to prepare regular trips by charter flights after 1997, making flight trips, thanks to the ability to negotiate quantity discounts, incredibly corroborated compared to the past.
At the end of the 90s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already had unscrupulous payment traffic with all the highly developed countries in the world, making travel even easier.
At another interesting moment in the history of \"post-general\" travel came in 2000, when due to the high demand of the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft have been flying with Czech passengers in faraway sunny countries every year; this year you fly twelve exotic destinations directly from the Czech Republic.
The 100 Tsd. Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the era that marked our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. lifted its visa to Czech tourists, which definitely led our country to join the highly developed countries of the world.
For the first time in 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than 15 Tsd. CZK per capita for a single holiday stay, including the costs at the resort.
The main meeting is to find a new chairman - again, a patt threatens.
For almost five months now, Czech football has not been chaired and has threatened that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary main meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
So far, there has been no agreement as to which electoral order to be elected.
Without it, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, challenging his colleagues to find some and a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old quarries between the two concordance chambers broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This proved to be stone and clear on 16 September when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the main meeting had come to the public house in the Prague district of Smíchov, because the negotiations resulted in no results and not only was it about the election itself.
After all, it was not even possible for some of them to vote on who is actually entitled to the full collection - only the legislative representatives or the officials equipped with a full force.
In this single point, at least partial agreement was reached, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, whose opinion is not held on a basis of power.
However, the disputes over the electoral order continue.
The Executive Committee also no longer provided clarity in the matter of which meetings, whether fair or extraordinary, are in principle nothing else on the agenda.
Even if the opinions regarding the election changed a few times, the neural point remained the same.
The question is, how should you go about the 3rd round to avoid a patt situation?
“The issue is whether to act in accordance with the statement, or whether to find a completely different model,” said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents the professional football in management.
According to a set model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he candidates.
Moren is allegedly ready to accept the compromise that the candidate wins the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side in turn consists on the condition that the winner receive at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
“Then the two front rounds have no sense at all, this mode would challenge the entire two-room concept,” Svoboda explains, “and the objections of the Morahic side, which it seems best not to add to the electoral order, but to choose according to the valid statute.
To be sure, Tomáš Paclík also agrees, even though it is clear that the legislative order of the election of all candidates is most likely to come against Pelta.
“My wish is that, as far as possible, it will be chosen according to the sentence.”
“As a result, no unwise replacement variants are designed, as in the last main meeting,” explained the owner (the football club) Victoria Plze, who applied for the first time and was primarily delimited to Pelta in his opinions.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
“The possible qualification of the national team for football EM today would certainly contribute to the calming of the mothers.”
“If football is only riding on the euphoric wave, the willingness to work together is also greater,” says Jablonec official, who brings the greatest experiences of all three adepts, both at a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more resilient.
“I hope for an agreement, but the situation is arduous,” he said.
\"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Mora, but there are certain efforts to \"provide\" the regulations for their own purposes.
“That’s why a new blocking at the main meeting is not excluded.
“I hope, however, that the healthy mind will ultimately win,” Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to get along with all the sides no longer remains.
Some negotiations are supposed to be played directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualification game.
The charter aircraft, which included Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl to Podgorice, could not start in Prague in the morning due to a technical disruption, and so a feverous search was made for a replacement variant, as a part of the executive committee was still to be brought to the location of the barrage backyard.
Finally, the meeting at the minister’s level is probably crucial, to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister of School, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to have the split parties within the country’s largest sports association to reach an agreement.
There is a lot to be done: state allocations, the reliability of Czech football and also the upcoming main meeting of the ČSTV, which is to guide Czech sport according to the financial problems of Prentka.
Paclík is in the fight for the position of chairman because he does not see any suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner football team, had been able to make a strong candidate before the extraordinary main meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the football association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have embarked on the fight for this top position at all.
“If there was a good lawyer, then I would fight for him and refuse the choice.”
“But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an ad,” Paclík ČTK said.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorites of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that in the event of his victory, he remembers the function of the chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary main meeting.
In the position of chairman he would like to see an experienced top manager who is not too much caught up in the football event.
“With some people in question, I have spoken in person,” he said.
“I can’t believe that some said they didn’t want to identify themselves with Czech football at the moment.
“These views would have changed,” he added.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly interferes with Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man of controversial reputation who is considered behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegates vote at main meetings.
For Paclík it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta had the position of chairman.
“In his victory, the present state would be preserved and Czech football would not go ahead at all.”
“The support from Berbr, a clever businessman, got double bad football,” Paclík said.
He also points out that Pelta’s name fell in connection with telephone calls some time ago to investigate a corruption case, but it was released from the Pelta.
“I don’t know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to football.”
“And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,” said řekl Paclík, whose earlier statement, “will sell the Pilsner Football Club if Pelta becomes chairman, but sees something more late.
If Paclík wins in the Thursday election, however, he can imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
In the same way, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the main meeting in October, who ended up with a fiasco.
\"He (Pelta) would be the first to whom I would go.\"
\"He has great abilities -
“I could well imagine him as the head of the national team, for example.
“But I don’t think he is able to lead the association as manager.”
“I don’t put my nose in matters that I don’t understand,” said Paclík, who had taken care of it in September to replace Dagmar Damková after the revocation of the Arbitration Commission with Luquer Macela.
Paclík himself claims he felt the role of the chairman of the association.
He is also the chief of Pilsen, who, with his support, celebrated the first triumph in the league in May.
“I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of it.”
“In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups who tend to influence disciplinary and vocation commissions, which are set apart in conflicting situations, Paclík added that no hell from his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympia Committee, with the help of which he would lobby with the political top politicians to ensure that more money from lottery tax flows into the sport.
“This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should devote himself to.
“When it comes to controlling gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their argumentation, but they also have to be firm and clear about where the money is going,” he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not see Paclík as a disability, although he himself emphasizes that the president of the FAČR must be \"overparty\".
Pelta in turn is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
“That’s not just ideal.
“It doesn’t make much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third-party person in order to return after a year and a half,” Paclík said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will trigger a Patt situation in the future.
Two days before the main meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates promised for the chairman's name, namely Miroslav Pelta, he will make a strong commitment in the event of his election that the FAČR will receive new statutes that in the future exclude disputes over the electoral order from the outset.
The Jablonec official is confident before Thursday’s negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will be secure in a possible success of Czech selection.
Pelta had promised before the unrealised election in September, he wanted to focus on the national team in the event of his election and the winning of financial resources.
He only decided on the last moment to participate in the election before the last main meeting, so the two-month break allowed him to defend his ideas on the management of football and present it in a broader context.
“Loud at all levels dedicates themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday.”
“He feels that it is the highest time that the association is led by someone, the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, who also acted at Sparta and the Executive Committee for many years.
He also believes that he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that today’s problems with choice are responsible for euphoria that existed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
“Leders were approved at the main meeting in June, which were not as perfect as all of them had assumed.
If they didn't allow different interpretations, we would have had a president from September - said Pelta.
He used the revision of the most important document of the civil society as a locker for the delegates.
“If I become chairman, I will accept it personally and be willing to bear personal responsibility if it does not work.”
“This is a principled thing, without which he can’t be,” Pelta claims.
Furthermore, he does not try to limit himself to his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognized because of his legal education, and he well knows that his opponent would be his first deputy.
Also, Tomáš Paclík had long since stopped attacking, which in turn did not leave a dry thread to Pelta.
In football, he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes.
However, his attacks were deplorable and many people were shocked by his campaign of election.
“That’s why many are now doubting his real character,” Pelta addressed his counterpart, who probably remained faithful to his proclamations, which he had already made in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest playing classes, to the national team.
And it should be the hanging shield of Czech football.
\"I would also try to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians, to the after-halls of the corruption scandal of the past year,\" he said.
“Just after that, I’d fall into negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funds for all of football,” said the sixty-six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football will not mean personal cleansing.
“I had to get familiar with the work content of all the workers,” he said towards Strahov, where, in view of the long anarchy, there is a sense of nervousness.
Despite the time-consuming catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming main meeting, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk without cause on Thursday.
“If it really should be the only controversial point you choose in the third round, then we’ll get over it.”
“The football needs credibility and it only wins back when it finally has a new leader,” Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly crucial day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If former deputy chairman Jindřich Rajchl was to be elected as the new chairman of the Czech Republic’s football association on Thursday, this would allegedly avoid many people in the association.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his election.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the case of Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, raise more money in football, and otherwise continue the work that the former chairman Ivan Hašek started.
“As chairman, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole.
Starting from international contacts with the UEFA and FIFA, through national selection, professional football, to the football performance for youth -
“I don’t want to say that I want to do everything alone,” Rajchl said in a conversation with ČTK.
“I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the powers in the Executive Committee so that each member is dedicated to a particular area.
And I will distribute hard tasks so that football in every segment progresses with miles.
In addition, many would not have enjoyed it just because she, rather than just criticize the work of others, had to start working really hard herself,” he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it took into consideration not to run at all.
“It is known to me that I work 20 hours a day.
“But I have to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who don’t put a button between the legs and question every step I’m taking,” he said as an explanation of why he’s put up with it.
“Many people told me that I should not give up because others would do the same.”
“That’s trust that you can’t play,” he said.
He was also motivated to continue the work he had started under Hašek.
“In two years we’ve managed a big piece of work and I don’t want to just throw it away now.”
“There have been processes that have probably only come to mind in a few years and I would only be nervous to see them stop someone,” he said, expressing his concern that in the event that the other candidate would choose Miroslav Pelta, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
“I believe in systematic action and that’s something Mirek Pelta doesn’t bring.”
“Hinder him, especially people who would make football so that he would only be there for electors.”
I may be accused of doing some things, but not that I would be participative.
“I strive to be objective.”
“I want football for everyone because it’s all going well and not just the chosen one,” Rajchl said.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czech Republic.
“Even if some people claim the opposite, I really want to do the best possible for mercenaries.”
“For example, it’s time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners will each rise to the first league.”
“Then it could not happen that today only three female clubs are playing in the league, which is a problem especially for young players in Mores,” Rajchl says.
Now that the head of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclík has joined the fight for the chairman's office, Rajchl does not trust to estimate his chances of being elected.
“I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, who has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me,” Rajchl added, who also sees the saving of tens of millions of crowns for unprofitable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations around the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he owes himself in part to the fact that the association does not draw on a single strand.
As he says by Pelta, he has been disqualified from being able to help Czech football with new confidence, he considers the second rival - Paclík to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
“No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year.”
\"If he were elected, then he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek had introduced and the personal occupation in the Commissions would obviously not change,\" he said.
He would certainly not want to turn things over to his favors - judge Rajchl over his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump to the Blue
by Julia Stanek
Planschbecken in Ufo-Optik, Prunkpools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience his blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike, rest the tired legs in sprudel baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past one and a half years, one in her luggage was not allowed to miss: her bath suit.
Rears lying on the water, she looked high in art-designed domes, facing swimming marble puts waiting on them at the beak edge, and marveled at acribically restored youth-style swimming halls.
Enjoying a bath, she took it in her notebook - along with knowledgeable details of the building's construction and history.
More than 200 swimming pools explore architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her newly published book “Badefreuden”: People’s swimming halls in Munich, historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, “Hardcore concrete buildings” in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, they visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and, respectively, a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
With sports, she doesn’t have much on her hat, says Meder - only in the water is that different.
Angry only that swimming fans need to find themselves with blue bowls and chlorinated tank, while joggers can breathe the depleting fragrance of moisture forests or listen to the cheerful bird-smoker in the park.
“I wondered one day why swimming pools must be so ugly,” says the Middleman living in Vienna.
“So I started collecting beautiful baths.
Water surface doubles architecture
Therefore, the wellness factor in baths is so large in the spring basin and essential sauna oils - because all senses are served, meds say.
And if the builders have given themselves effort, swimming halls can be a true oasis: “In baths one has a water surface.”
“She is transparent on the one hand, but reflects the beauty of the whole building.
Everything doubles optically: high waves, colorful bowls, jumpboards.
The small-format image band “Badefreuden” on 190 pages imparts knowledge of the architecture and cultural history of historical wellness oasis, but is primarily interested in a leap into the blue.
Notable specimens discovered the pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent health baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found a nitrat-containing water in an original carshole (hole bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose basins are filled with alkali-containing water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor baths in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in view of the Zurich roof bath, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bathroom in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can observe the drifting on the ski piste.
Perhaps the most exceptional pool design is waiting for bath guests in length: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a newly landed Ufo in the Alps.
In winter it evaporates from three upward shells, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal in the sky .
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector meddles the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell to Schwefel, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it so strongly tastes for heating oil that one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose slick one is glued to the skin as soon as you can slip into the basin - a wellness experience of the special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful baths: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbath in the Czech Bad Luhatshowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bathroom, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
When Meder threw a view through the weathered windows of the red-white-green youth-style building, she saw how weeds grew between the rabbits.
On the other hand, the decline has been counteracted in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three stages of construction already have this bath; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements that originate from the days of its construction in 1844, but also a mauric hall in Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool of the Iris Meder pool, and this is not just because it was originally from the Black Forest.
“It’s already a performance to merge so different styles into such a great unit,” Meder says.
In the case of such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only by side.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank is letting raw materials business go through
By Christian Tevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up their business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the chief of the group will then take a turn.
Hamburg - Hamburg
For the German citizen, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of the respondents are demanding that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it makes the world’s poorest problems worse.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study was based on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In this, author Harald Schumann shows that betting on the global raw materials markets is going to increase prices - and that is why banks bear a debt to global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is focused specifically on German bank chief Josef Ackermann, even though large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw material betting was intended to secure traders against price fluctuations.
Now, however, most experts agree that the experts have depleted themselves from supply and demand - and are making profit at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to check the allegations and said that no business is \"valued to put the good reputation of the German bank into play.\"
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an International Working Group is currently checking the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the exam will be completed, then the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of the German Bank - including recommendations on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the top of the bank will then tell what consequences it will bring.
In the end, a reduction in the raw material business could be, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann bastelt at his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial industry: \"Betting on rising prices of food shows particularly dramatically how careless banks are damaging the general welfare today.\"
Ackermann now stands as the top bank lobbyist in particular.
“The Deutsche Bank must remove all the facilities from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices,” Bode said.
Whether Mr. Ackermann is about hungry people or about the reputation of the German bank,
The insight of Ackermann comes at first surprise, but it is clear that the chief of the company wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Board of Directors will not switch to the Supervisory Board other than planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order for him to be able to escape, he would hardly have to shave - that would eventually have to do his successor.
Each second would terminate raw material plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 internet users have already participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 11 percent believe it is legitimate for the Deutsche Bank to offer facilities in which prices for food are marketed.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such businesses: each second would, according to the survey, terminate all the facilities in which money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would waive acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent stated they thought they would terminate their account and switch to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The New Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and happy end: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became the museum in Vienna, stood empty and came to an end.
Now he will be re-opened as an exhibition house.
When watered by modern post-war architecture, by clear shapes, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schweizer is a striking and famous example for the 1958 Brüssler World Exhibition.
Swinners Pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel glass construction.
To this day, construction is considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made known to the architect that he also built the next world exhibition of Austria’s Pavilion.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus a small building in Munich, he eventually became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition construction, had been erected at the Vienna South Station after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden, and in 1962 a 20th-century museum opened in it - the “20th-century house” was called it.
However, the building was not spacious and technical as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has more and more fallen down.
Now, architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, he now calls it “21st house” and is in the future used as a museum of contemporary art.
Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a luck case in any way.
The new Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a prolific art historian with considerable career, among others in youth as an ice-art runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, continued the remodeling of politicians and memorialists, it acquired public funds and private sponsor funds and established its use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the same-named foundation, a café and a bookstore were to exist, and an office house had to be built to do so.
Strict supervision, small etat
For the execution, Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had converted and expanded Joseph Olbrich’s secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him was an “unusually important place” at which he had seen the exhibitions “almost every weekend.”
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which had already lost on his move to Vienna and his re-use of generosity and ease.
In today’s reconstruction, there were far greater problems: the building was “an energy veil,” Krischanitz says.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulating glass and the glass roof replaced with special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been cleaned.
Two undershots brought room for new use, a low light dig between house and street provides exposure, a bridge leads to entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house has been cut in the old red-brown rustproof color.
And the cinema room is even just as it used to be.
And all of this under strict supervision of the memorial authority and with a small etat.
“Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the memorial protection office,” Krischanitz says, pointing to a rough floor in the lower floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstructions, the building remained flexible and easy.
It has been difficult with the pavilion, \"who came from Brussels\", Krischanitz recently said, a typical \"drop-in-the-city history\"
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place, and still wants to create a proper consciousness”
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because it has entered a city-building accident: around the Swiss garden, the fully re-planned \"head station quarter\" with office and residential houses is created.
And another case of luck may still occur: The 21st house could be strengthened by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art hall, and as you hear it, she already negotiates with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss garden.
Train plans winter crisis package at millions of height
The train has launched a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, the Deutsche Bahn also issued a newspaper report of over €70 million this year.
The \"Picture\" newspaper reported in advance, calling for a corporate crisis plan, that investments of around 300 million euros were provided by 2015.
This means that better availability of vehicles and rail networks is also achieved in extreme weather conditions.
It is planned, among other things, to double the internal and external employees for snow removal on railways and railways to 16,000 persons.
The aim is to free railways from snow and ice within four to five hours of the start of the operation and 90 percent of the necessary weeks.
Two months ago, railway chief Rüdiger Grube had warned of train failures and delays even in this winter after a top meeting with government and industry.
Last winter, the train had significant problems in passenger transport, as it lacks reserves in difficult weather conditions.
For years, many new regional trains have been waiting for a permit from the railway service.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also been making years to create that it needs to have axles of ICE trains tested significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE in Cologne's main station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the United States
After the tumult by Chef Josef Ackermann, new Ungemach comes from the United States: Deutsche Bank must pay a million dollars there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for the Deutsche Bank, the industry giants are still getting its past in the US: The Frankfurt Institute is paying $15 million in a comparison (106 million) to settle disputes because of the gap of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA plans to have a wide range of large banks seduced the cooperative banks with false promises to purchase the financial products; they would have played down the risks.
Such papers have been heavily lost during the financial crisis, and the banks are tearing into the depths.
“We are satisfied that we could solve the issue without the parties having to move to court,” said a German bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not make any debt with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to paying $20.5 million.
The NCUA chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the arrival of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and jumps into pleas to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the resulting billionaire damage.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also knocked on other large banks and charged JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage papers in question are called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the U.S. property blaze placed in 2007, this became a multiplicity of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the U.S. Investment Bank took over Lehman Brothers.
Even if the events have been behind for a few years, the banks are currently crying a sharp wind in the United States.
Investors and supervisory authorities have tried to make numerous complaints to obtain reparations or to avoid failure.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It faces 18 international major banks to have over Benefited from two U.S. property funders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at mortgage stores in the volume of around $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to face a FHFA complaint, which is about several businesses worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurters stand straight for “substantial losses” without calling an exact sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unstoppable and declared to want to defend itself.
Warren Buffett is home to IBM with 10 billion
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the major American investor Warren Buffett has always stated not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies can only be forecast poorly.
Now, however, he has read IBM's business reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He has had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight’s strike in the financial world.
As a result, the IT-Urgestein IBM can now be called 'Sir IBM'.
Buffett now revealed in the U.S. air station CNBC that he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management that even in the economic crisis had provided proper profits.
“You’ve done a great job,” Buffett said.
IBM has been focusing on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful company furniture.
Buffett had avoided technology companies until that time.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett accessed, for example, a freight railway, in the case of a lubricant manufacturer or machine builder.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns around 80 own subsidiaries in a number of major companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Municher Back.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had acquired the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and had it integrated with smart investments into one of the world’s most valuable companies.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money brought him the nickname “Orakel of Omaha”.
After becoming known for the Buffett investment, IBM’s action rose by one percent.
“Big Blue, as IBM is called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the world’s most valuable technology companies along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn’t want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the \"Zwickauer Zelle\" the Turkish media in the German state of law doubted.
A newspaper even speaks of a “bloody ideology” that has now been revived.
The murders of eight Turkish tribes and a Greek small businessman in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This message is responded with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German population in Germany.
For many German Turks, this has resulted in the return of a long-dead spirited ghost: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is animosity in Germany has never been in question.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is long-term.
“Let the bloody ideology return to life, titled the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper ‘Haberturk’
On the other hand, the Sabah newspaper emphasizes that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be engaged in the legal radical swamp.
In particular, the Turkish municipality of Germany responded: She remembered the victims of racist violence on the weekend with a Mahnwache in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Just two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a celebration of the fiftyth anniversary of the German-Turkish employment agreement.
In happy colors, it was staged together - as a history of success.
As an ear-feige, some Turkish media reports: “Germany’s 50th gift is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform “Haber X” which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the 'Hürriyet' can't take up this meaningful connection.
“It starts to smell,” is the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people have been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In addition, in German Internet forums, the conduct of the police and their subsequent successful investigation will be discussed.
Why it has not been much more common for German authorities to seek suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Some of them show up at least rhetorically to drastic means: “If the migrants continue to be lit here, then nothing remains but self-defense and armament.
“This will probably be the best self-defense.
“Because of the goodness of the enlightenment and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network, the internal peace in Germany depends very heavily on the quality of the network,” writes Selen.
What it means when domestic peace is at risk in Germany, the attacks of mills and solings in the 1990s illustrate.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the feeling on the Turkish side.
Don't repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics was particularly met after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After Solingen's fire attack, he sent an acclaim to the Turkish State Presidents, but was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the celebration of mourning in Cologne - Kinkel then counted in his speech on how many donations the so-called Turks had made.
As a matter of fact, the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his tax duties.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks has since been in the so-called rule of law.
In addition to the efforts of extensive clarification and re-estimation of far-right terrorism in Germany, it needs open words this time.
The Scandal Bank of Zurisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS was nearly bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since been hit by a crisis in the next.
Now it should be directed by a German.
That's how Axel Weber certainly didn't think.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would be joining an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was pleased publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly won solidarity and made friendly remarks about future colleagues.
“The UBS has made the turnaround.”
“I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.
However, in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A UBS trader in London had gone through all bank security systems and lost around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only in Switzerland, had to go.
Since then, UBS’s Board of Directors has also been attacked - and all questions: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been announced that Weber will be able to consult the Bank from February 2012.
And the Board of Directors is already taking over in May - not just in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it will be hard.
He is not a banker, rather an economics professor and a note banker, and would certainly have needed a workout time.
With a blow, he then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that he longed to earn the title of Europe’s largest scandal bank.
Because the UBS, on the one hand, is huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset administrator - and, on the other hand, has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, will save the once so proud Swiss bank.
It began in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the hideous and solid, but also out-of-date Swiss asset manager had combined them with ambitious goals: they also wanted to become a very large number in investment banking.
On the one hand, in 2007, the UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And, on the other hand, as an investment bank, she was pushed into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later longtime bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger relates: “My students always set the UBS as a pattern of a good bank at the time.
“From today’s point of view, we ask ourselves, ‘How could I be so wrong?’
He was so wrong.
In 2007, it was first revealed that something was going on in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli was surprised to return, which until then was considered a highly intellectual and also brilliant banker.
A few months later, he was not sure why he went.
The bank’s investment savings had been halved with subprime papers and had to write down billions.
In order to protect this, the UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of say and wrote 13 billion francs.
For this, she actually found investors, but which, over which some, until recently, had yet to rip the nose: an intangible Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was so distant that one did not even know his name.
But that was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it was worse.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, Board President Marcel Ospel, the second most paid board in Switzerland, in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS was in the face of its failure to invest in the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank bought the UBS for thirty billion problematic securities, the Swiss Eidgemschaft gave six billion francs for a forced conversion bond over which it could become the bank’s co-owner.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it is so large banks.
Finally, the UBS 2007 balance sheet was more than five times as large as Switzerland’s economic performance (see graphic).
“We couldn’t save the UBS once more,” says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster joined the second.
For a few months now, UBS had capitalized on tax disputes with America and was willing to issue the data of potential customers who might have withdrawn with the help of the bank tax.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a refund of unjustified profits from these stores as well as fines.
Thus, the UBS was known to have been more or less open to assist in the tax withdrawal.
At the same time, they lost something that had always been their capital in competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of Silence.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors.
And the Exodus of customer funds.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking through the misspeculations and in the asset management through the assistance for tax recovery.
And just as it became a bit quieter again, just as you thought, now the UBS will get back to it, then this odd trader story follows: A single dealer lost $1.7 billion before the bank finds something going wrong.
And it becomes apparent: with the risk management in investment banking, it obviously still doesn’t work.
“With the Adoboli case, it has been found that risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the banking institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial board of a large German bank is also certain: “The problem of UBS is that it does not handle risk control”
It was precisely the idea that the Swiss bankers had long gone on to become guardians of the great wealth of the world: not too big risks, for money security, even beyond the Alpine Republic, could collapse the world.
Swiss banks’ tresores have become a symbol of unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the well-deserved Swiss private bank - it is only a bit larger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters at Zurich railway station, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry such as Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprungli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS is entered by a heavy rotational door.
In addition to the bank logo, the walls are marble-dressed, with thick leather armchairs in front of the bank logo, a large sign of \"safe\"
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss bank has pushed both Swiss major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, and finally, like all Swiss bankers, he does business with the two major banks.
The UBS has become much too big, especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also spread.
The Swiss had nothing to say there.
“If they have, they have long adapted the seats of the Anglo-Saxons.”
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, which changed the UBS, that first paid high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
“On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million countries decided the biggest rescue action in the history of their nation,” writes author Lukas Hässig in his book “The UBS Crash.”
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank before the bankruptcy.
How could it come about?
Speaking to Swiss bankers, they see the problem, especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss Grand Banks joined a huge group.
There was a bank that was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and continued to grow.
In doing so, the two different predecessor banks of UBS complemented each other: a rich but sleeping bank with the focus of asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalised.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers were able to make a lot of money with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Group Chief of the UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest person who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who has worked up from the bank doctrine to the very top.
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake in the end: “He thought his models were reality,” Geiger said.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragically, maybe.
It is clear that pride came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings where Group Chief Wuffli repeatedly issued the same parole: Goldman Sachs fired from the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
It introduced the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
Then the UBS wanted to go up.
Some steps have already been made for you.
In the foreign exchange business and in the stock trade, she played at the top.
However, corporate advisors who were assigned have a weakness: In the international interest rate business, in the banker’s language ‘Fixed income’, there is a huge gap between the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS turned into an adventure that it almost cost its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund established in American subprime investment.
She developed into a huge machine that packed and continued securities on U.S. mortgage loans, but also kept risks.
Even when other banks were looking for the exit.
“In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought it there,” says bank expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager had to go after the other as the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS have become the seat of locker and are still vigilant.
Those who run the big bank now have a nearly impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has come down to all the nearby business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: close with investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
So far, the bank does not want to go.
But the investment banking is going to shrink strongly, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti of the world will present his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo brother-in-law was actually only thought of as a transition solution when the bank suddenly separated from previous troubles.
Meanwhile, he has continued: he will continue to run the UBS’s businesses permanently, the Zurich Bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to the state of the mid-nineties.
There are 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is asking himself now.
So far, he’s just saying he’s going to look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens U.S. stock exchange
The threat of recession in Europe has given the U.S. investors the courage to wake up.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained unbeaten.
The dried industrial production on the continent sparked hopes for a stabilize of the debt crisis in the germ.
The general relief over the change in government in Rome and Athens could not continue.
The euro fell over the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still half full in the last week, not half empty, but now pushed the problems back into the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the sales list.
The Dow-Jones index of standard values noted at the conclusion of trade with a minimum of 0.6% at 12,078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer commuted between 12.027 and 12.170 points.

The Nasdaq Technology Network Index lost 0.8 percent and went out of trade with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax agreed with a minimum of 1.2 percent at 5985 meters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is focusing on the end of the upturn.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, as the Statistics Office announced.
“We are not an island, but dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get out of a recession as soon as possible, and there are further signs of weakness in the banks.
Investigating Warren Buffett confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it is too early to invest in European state bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade old principle on the pile and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment over $10 billion in IBM gave rise to the share price of the tradition group and made it almost a percent higher against the trend in trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
According to Buffett, on average, he paid $170 per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America’s shares of shares were significantly higher than the market with 2.6 percent.

At the Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares in 630 in the Plus, 1913 in the Minus and 82 were excluded.
Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places, seeds are considered “problem birds”: however, the highly intelligent animals can no longer be displaced from the cities, experts claim.
One likes them, the other wants to get rid of them very quickly: Craws have been part of the city scene for centuries, but in many municipalities there are complaints about draught and noise of the animals.
There is no way that a means against the 'problem birds' has been in sight.
Seeds were no longer to be obtained from the cities, said experts at the first crow symposium in the Eastern Fries.
There, experts from all over the federal area advise on possible exits.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Nature protectors also reduced the problems in cities to the land flight of the particularly protected seed crop: the chemical use in agriculture increasingly destroyed the traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing cultivation, and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for birds.
Craws are under the protection of nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding couples are located in Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Deepwood and Achim near Bremen and in Empty.
There, in 2005 a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the county had provided for negative headlines.
Critics had called the capture of the animals in bird trap and the striking with buttons as particularly brutal.
“The normal displacement that is taking place brings nothing — the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver has found out from empty.
Nesters spraying away with water or falling trees often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
“The animals are soft out, large colonies are split up and distributed in other places.
Greed is only possible as an exception to hospitals, old-fashioned homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we don’t get them away anymore.”
Without the surrounding country, the problem could not be solved in the cities, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner said.
It is possible to combine the sizes of the animals from sensitive living areas and lock offerings to resuscitate them in other places.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different treatment of the animals: “A pickle in the face can finally be most self-conscious.”
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpaad, which informed the signer of the life of the highly intelligent seed.
The project is already being adopted by tourists.
Even for criticism of the noise of birds, Jürgens had his own opinion: “There is a lot of communication that has a lot to say.”
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed crops not only use tools to get to a delight bite, but even produce their own tools as a tool.
At the University of Cambridge, behavioral researchers recently tested on four seed grains as far as bird intelligence is concerned.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that with stones they had to bring a gear to collapse in order to get to a moth larvae.
Without much training, they recognized the purpose of what size and shape a stone must have in order to collabate the platform.
In a second attempt, the prickly crows then had to solve a knee-sensitive problem.
In a cylinder set up at right, the researchers placed a small egg with a moth larvae.
The birds could not reach their prey with the snack.
However, the researchers had put them in wire pieces.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then anchored the egg at the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seedlings even reached Anhieb.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup remained.
The favorites of Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are at EM 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have released the latest tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
led by double successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd) Portugal defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM division perfect after the 0:0 from the play.
The Czechs had a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off back game at outside Montenegro, after the play (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
There was nothing more to burn in Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland got a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) met for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trade meter (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had twice shortened for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red map (54).
Bosnia and Herzegovina had already failed in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
Portugal had a start in the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo chased a release from about 30 meters to the early lead into the masks.
A good quarter hour later, Nani showed his wide-ball qualities and met from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City put a headball on the lower edge of the Latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek meets for the Czech Republic
Subsequently, arbitrator Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding stood at the center.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penitentiary, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36).
On the opposite side, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who certainly converted Misimovic.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-European champion made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubt in the 81st minute.
In this way, the 1976 European Champion will run the EM for the fifth time in a row.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga-Legionaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to survive a horror second in the initial phase.
Finally, with a reflection, Petr Cech prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its biggest possibilities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic just barely passed the gate of Cech in the 40th minute from the rotation of the prison space limit.
After the break, the cross-latte had to save for the Czechs’ already-slaughtered world-class quarter, and again the FC Seoul's storm had withdrawn (50).
Shortly before the end, everything was clear.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football wonder.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not come beyond a 0:0.
While National Trainer Guus Hidddink has to make his place on the bank of the World Cup of 2002 as safe as possible, the Croats can be delighted about their fourth participation in an EM final round.
Before 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met in the seventh minute with a distance shot only the Pfosten, attacker Kazim Kazim was unable to sink the impacter into the gate.
After the terror second, however, Croatia increasingly took control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who made room for the Dortmund Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga-Legionaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni rides to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first EM-participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4:0 success in the play, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) is the same for guests.
Ireland pushed at the pace from the start, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
It was only at the last moment that the Estonian rear team prevented the possible leadership strike.
It was in the 32nd minute.
After a crashed defence by finalist Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball to 1:0 above the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software manufacturer SAP will invest billions in China in the next few years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) were to flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research and development facilities and set up appropriate employees,” Co-Chief Bill McDermott announced at a Beijing customer fair.
The company is expected to grow from around 2500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader for corporate software will double from five to ten or eleven.
Since then SAP has been present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the more than 176,000 SAP customers worldwide are in the tree country.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the strategy of the Dax Group in 2015.
SAP aims to increase sales to €20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had saved around $12.5 billion.
Currently, the software provider’s business, which employs 55 000 employees worldwide, runs as rarely as before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to expand our activities (...),” said McDermott.
“Our aim is to promote sustainable growth in China through comprehensive education,” he said.
Mass slaughter at a personal level
Eager and generous, Peter Englund begins his new book “Beautifulness and Fear. A History of World War I, told in nineteen fates - with a long list of chiefs who go to the heart.
Here's a hint on how to do this: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund’s romantic narrative, and these chiefs will work as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you, like Englund’s men and women, are lost in the fog of the war and robbed of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book, which he describes as “a work of anti-history.”
It contains only a few great names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, racing reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It’s less a book about what happened, he explains, rather, a book about how it was — it’s about “feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.”
\"Beautifulness and horrors - almost the war experiences of 20 more or less unobtrusive men and women on both sides of the war together, from school girls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, nurses and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, become mad or die.
Each of these lives flakes up like the votive candles in a church, some of which are coming while others are removing.
Englund's book is based on the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating war of position on the Western Front.
\"Beautifulness and horrors - walk with an expert view of other warviews: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book, bee baskets, a celebration of Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen are an unresolvable problem.
This is almost a moving book from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina, who smells like a cordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's at home with her children and hearing cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or take the flight?
Who's coming?
No one understands what happens or why this war is being fought at all.
“Fellowing facts,” Englund notes, “words with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors on furniture”
“Beautifulness and horrors” follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpmp, a young German ship mattress.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life reports may be frightening or overwhelming, but they are extremely vivid in the English of the collection of small moments that are lost in details.
Many of them are in need and help themselves.
In the story of a German school girl, he says: \"Separate, everywhere replacement\"
\"Selving coffee, false aluminum, false radrum, paper hooks, wood buttons\"
He tells me more about the replacement meal in Germany.
He describes “Fleish made of pressed rice and baked in hammel fat (and lastly served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes ground with wood.
There were, as he noted, \"837 registered food substitutes allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes\"
Some stories deal with honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to be wild and says about the war: “You feel that despite everything that was better intended for men than sitting in the chair, with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and so to do as if such a façade civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind his own strengthened and complained shirtbrush.”
Conversely, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and no one will take note of it or take care of it.
“If you take away from the idea of self-sacrifice, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience,” he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as “a condemned man who was hanged in secret.”
Other observations deal with the old Europe, which falls apart, and with new types of terror.
“The conflict became increasingly an economic competition,” writes Englund, “a war between factories.
He starts the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the bestiarium of the young century”: “the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderer in measure, who beats while sitting behind a desk.”
People behave in an unpredictable way and there are as free conduct as heroism.
Englund is discussing the soldiers who actively tried to get involved in a prostitute with a sex disease to escape front service.
“The grand expression of it can be discovered in the trade with Gonokkok-Eiter, for soldiers bought and gnashed their genitals, hoping to come to the hospital,” he writes.
“Those who were really desperate thrust him into the eyes, leading to their being blind to the rest of their lives.”
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes smooth and yet inexhaustible and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he begins the way the war \"in a uniquely uncontrollable force: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.\"
People begin to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books on World War I were mostly more falsified than Paul Fussell's Great War and Modern Memory, or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's, in the West, than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read in a book.
I don't give it anymore.
But it is as if he had snuffed us away with his book this page with the principals in front of the nose and lit us with a string of wood.
After an early failure a minutious planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved in some of them wearing helmets.
It was decided for the night from Monday to Tuesday because at that time, there were few people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. All the others initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence emphasized the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The events of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the Dissernate and gave the houseowners a huge increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials strengthened the so-called chaos school - measures aimed at promoting terrorism, including the rapid move of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to move into the park came “in the last minute,” someone who was familiar with the orders said what was said for a declaration as “exercise”.
“The few police officers involved in my knowledge didn’t know that it was about Zuccotti Park,” said someone who wanted to stay anonymous.
“The only ones who knew it was about the Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the resort.
One reason for secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14 officials wanted to clean up the park, but then they turned back when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned of these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation of Tuesday, including commissions from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are usually used in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that over the course of the day, many people enter and go to the park, almost like pendlers, so that 1 o’clock in the night is a good time to go in.
“It was appropriate to do this when the lowest number of people in the park stopped,” he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and speakers were ready for departure at the Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the messages recorded in advance that drank from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
As the public officials in their bright blue wind jackets in the park ended up, many protesters simply grabbed their things together and left the place.
Police said that by 1:45 p.m., no tents would be taken to give the protesters time to pack their property and good together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the surrounding area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesperson for the police, said this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists claim that they want to stop them from watching police actions in the park, and they said the handling of the officials has been very rough.
Mr Browne said that TV cars in Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved toward the west through the great dissension on personal matters of protesters, including suitcases, art terraces, and bags of clothes, their employees of the city-cleaning, who had been lifted up, followed what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside, and images of this appeared on the internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters was located near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the Parks Position.
Some built-up barriers and police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp are tied together on their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr Kelly said.
Officials of the disaster protection were called for to get rid of them.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests in the park were carried out until about 3:30 p.m.
The room was completed after 75 minutes after the police said.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests, as he said, were due to “unfavourable arrests and resistance to arrests.”
The most prominent local official was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officer of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Chief of Criminal Officers' Department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly “did not lead the operation” as Mr. Browne said.
In the event that they should access, a second group of officials were waiting on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a roadblock north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It could be observed how from these sites from the police, the surrounding area continued to expand around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place it was observed how several officials, many of them with protective signs, drove people outside.
About 28 people were located in the northern part of the district.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5:00 a.m., a protester jumped south of Pine Street on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of lockwood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Trade union of the caretakers will submit a complaint against the city for resignation
The union, representing hundreds of school caregivers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the resignations are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on schools that teach poor students.
The complaint is probably the last opportunity open to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse the resignations.
Six hundred and seventy-six school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid employees in the city and had lost their jobs on October 7th, the trade union leader as a political revenge for refusing access to a health fund that the employers had been conducting last year to close the budget.
This charge was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing by the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said last month that the resignations were part of the budget that was approved in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and explained to him that in the budget, nothing specified that employees would be released from school aid.
Officials of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference where the submission of the complaint to the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The complaint will be performed by Mr. Walcott and the City's Ministry of Education as a defendant and will count eight dismissed workers as complainers, all of whom are colourful or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice of the City, said the city is not lying to the complaint and therefore its individual allegations cannot be commented on.
According to a complaint filed by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of dismissals in the schools in the poor neighborhoods of the city to support a complaint for inequality, claiming that poor schools had lost more helpers since they were chronically underfinanced.
She explains that while there were no dismissals on Staten Island and only a few dismissals in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers were released in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the assessment of the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint says: “This is not a neighborhood of disadvantaged parents who can organize donations to capture budget cuts.”
P.S.: The 36th district budget was reduced by 3.26% this year. In addition, funds were lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the leaders of the high schools were led by the language in a memo which approved the release of the nursing coordinators.
The memo used the English word “excess” to describe the action, even though “excess” (German: translate) in the U.S. usually describes the change of a teacher from a school’s salary list to a pool of workers available from the central office.
“Sixty-six care coordinators were released, not transferred,” the complaint said.
Mission ended, Congress ready to understand itself with regard to Libya
Finally, it seems as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington were already in a position to understand themselves with regard to the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the termination of the American intervention.
On Thursday, the Committee on International Relations of the Senate will make a resolution that is supported by President John Kerry (Massachussets) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their \"must\".
“This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who started rebuilding their country,” Kerry said.
“It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties.
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House fought over the election of a series of resolutions to justify or disprove the role of the U.S. military in the Libyan mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that approved the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin of both parties and there was no vote.
However, on the same day, this law was passed in the Senate, and the Chamber also agreed to a decision to shorten the funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission went into a kind of legislative fégé - with a Congress that had been imposed enough to criticize Obama's actions in the context of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull him away from the ground under the feet.
Then the undisclosedness of Congress was taken over by the events.
Tripoli fell in August among Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations “gratifies Libyan people for their enormous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-freedom” and praises the men and women of the U.S. military and its coalition partners who support military operations to protect people in Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.
The resolution also reaffirms \"the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy\"
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Board or will they split the legislatures as the law of June did?
The last version is based on the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the Committee's top Republican.
On Monday, Lugar’s spokesperson said he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional legislative period of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area that is currently coming to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far unsuccessfully tried to make their changes to vote, even though they often tried it enough.
Good-latting change is only one of 68 constitutional changes that this Congress has presented and includes a wide range of topics.
Some are double - the same law has been presented to both Congress and the Senate - other soft ones are just slightly different from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would “control the amount of expenditure.”
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients, especially the Republicans, who want to update their course of life, the opportunity to boast that they have such a measure.
The Budgetal Control Act, adopted in August, requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can make, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the restrictions on two presidential periods.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of changes that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits a marriage under same-sex marriage is as much as a change that prohibits the burning of flags, an ever-repeating template.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be abolished if two-thirds of the states refuse to do so.
As keenly as the members suggest changes, they move as fast as they have in recent years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators presented 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly suggested more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment, which was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
“Killed but not defeated,” says Giffords in the first TV interview after the assassination.
Ten months after an armed man had shot at them at Tucson during an election, Republican Gabrielle Giffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday evening alone on the Broadway piece “The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow” and said that the desire to recover was greater than the one to return to Congress.
When she appeared in the ABC news together with Diane Sawyer, she ranked words and needed help when walking.
The broadcast showed the severe slow recovery from the damage the bullet, which divided its skull, pierced through the left side of its brain and crossed its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she suddenly returned to Congress to give her voice to the debt brake.
In their first TV interview after the assassination in January, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang — and described her healing as “hard”
When he asked her how she felt, Gifford replied, \"All right.
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour “20/20” special, recorded shortly before the release of the couple’s new book: “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope”
The special was followed by Gifford's recovery since the assassination of 8 January.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, she was seen in the hospital bed, with cold shaved head and a long shell over the forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nickel with the head.
A tug with the lips.
And then, their first words: “What?”
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: \"Toast - you want her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show show show show that music played an important role in Giffords' Healing: You see how the Congressman sings along with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun” and to Tom Petty’s “Free Fallin”.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords said he spent two hours daily with therapy that she cannot remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he had read Gifford’s article on the assassination on March 12 when she interrupted him and asked the six people who had been killed during the assassination for the first time.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is forced to be treated medically while waiting for his trial.
“Many people have died,” Gifford said.
“The heart, the heart, the heart.”
In the course of his wife’s recovery, Kelly told Sawyer, “I was hit,” she said.
“So, I would say, ‘Gabby, you haven’t been defeated,’” Kelly said.
You were only hit.
And you will endure and you will recover and come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala, which collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sings a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a tag, hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines gathered around him.
The amount of black smokes rose up and applauded.
“The soldiers and the soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the donation action in spring.
A senior military officer on the Gala, who was watched by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced like orphans,” the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know.
But it was no respect, really not.
The strong conflicting impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most reprehensible, sometimes bewildering American public.
The troops are overcrowded with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say service officials.
The public is increasingly concerned that they are suffering people in uniform.
“We were not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way to help is to push us into the role of unhappy souls.”
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in a dispute with the public they serve.
They also recognized that the anger that returned troops resisted in the last few years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations about compassion are taking place in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from battles with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe as they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if an angry, violent veteran was hiding under the surface, Cancian, who had been involved in Iraq and had taken over an elevated state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interrogators asked subtle questions as to whether he was able to stand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from fighting.
“If you talk about your service, you have to keep negative impressions against it,” Cancian told his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is in part rooted in the lack of interest of Americans in the war.
A country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is rarely seen as a praise.
“We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroship as it was still absolutely common in World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., commanded by the U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a service member.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or for the severity of their injuries.
The military faces the growing pressure to take strong action in the face of rape
This week, an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-commissioned rape before the military court.
If it does not, hundreds of prosecutors are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier colleague at night.
It was October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12th pack of beer.
He asked her if he would accompany her to a drink in her room.
“My alarm bells went on,” Lyman said.
However, the Texaner had her concerns on the side.
I thought, \"What, he's 19.
He’s from Texas,” she said.
“I wish I had heard of my stomach feeling.
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man walked behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claimed.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officers anxiously await a trial with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, deciding whether a complaint they have filed against former defense minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought before the court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not gone against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., filed the complaint at first included 17 prosecutors, who, however, rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by military colleagues, and that the military failed to determine, condemn or provide an adequate case after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she is pursuing the top military leadership, as the problem begins there.
“The military has been constructed hierarchically,” she says.
“Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says that since February she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors, many of whom may be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of putting all the accused's eggs into a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many more complaints to maintain the pressure.
The defense team, led by state attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to reject the appeal.
The acts of the court that are present in Newsweek are detailed in the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries to which it has come in the armed forces.
In view of a 1950 Supreme Court law, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries committed by soldiers in active service.
“The alleged damage occurred during the military service of the prosecutors,” the document says.
The Ministry of Defense rejects any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction is in the name only: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are increasingly playing important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat operations.
It is time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more complaints besides them are hanged.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a complaint against the four main military academies for alleged promotion of a woman's hostile atmosphere.
Independently, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is presenting a complaint against the military in which one focuses on the diagnosis of “personality disorder,” the rape victims received to release them from service, a common procedure according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women’s Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration (i.e. administration of war veterans) in which she favoured her discriminatory practices in dealing with performance claims for persons who stated to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were passed independently of each other through a mix of senators and representatives of both parties to Congress, which offer a number of points of reference.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (i.e., Office for Prevention and Notice of Sexual Abuse), 3,158 sexual abuses were reported by the Ministry of Defense.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 cases to which it comes each year.
The report, published in March, also examines the law enforcement rates: In 2010, 20 percent of the reported cases in the military were in court, only half as many as in civil law.
The prosecutors in Burkes Fall describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole series of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, who came from a cut on her arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked for the sex she had before the assault with her friend.
Six people expressed themselves as character witnesses in the name of the alleged offender, who was ultimately acquitted.
“I still remember well the day when the judgment was read,” Lyman says.
“I thought the tears would be put in place. I ran out of the courtroom screaming.
“They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander: This was not his procedure.
Lyman was asked to seek out a military psychiatrist, who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was unjustly released, so she won’t receive any support.
Whether the complaint filed by Lyman and the other prosecutors is progressing is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
In spite of this, he notes: “In my view, they should progress.”
What stands between them and a ruling is this doctrine that is criticized since it was questioned for the first time.
I'm a critic of the Feres doctrine.
A decade later, the military does not have the same incentive and the same deterrence that a liability brings.
He added: \"The chances stand against them...but it's important for them to try it.\"
These things will change only if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow their way, Burke, the prosecutor’s lawyer, will begin with her hundreds of other prosecutors for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this respect until it comes to reforms,” she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens to be the first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many boys who sent their anti-immigrant opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who had been in the process of an amoccal in Norway in July, had his first public hearing in court, killing 77 people.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you only have to log in to Facebook.
“We have found that it wasn’t hard to get to them,” said Jamie Bartlett, the chief author of a recently published report by the UK’s DEMOS Ideas factory on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding of personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says the researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the site to accurately answer their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have done for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then viewed them with additions, but instead of linking with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking for their level of education, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries, without having to leave their offices.
“It’s a fairly new method of research,” Bartlett said.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online leaders of far-right groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, “those who combine their online activity with an offline activism are more reasonable, democratic, and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens.”
DEMO’s work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the page to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, Facebook’s data supernova generates a research boom that has increased the number of scientific work with the name of this page in the title in the last five years by almost 800%.
For some researchers, Facebook’s beauty is the fact that you can study through this page people that you usually don’t reach with its clipboard on the street.
“If you used to try to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“They first had to inform the party and it would never have given them access,” Bartlett said.
“For Facebook, it’s all gone - you’re going to go directly to them.”
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to recognize and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full-time on Facebook tend to drink significantly more problem than students who are struggling with this issue.
Moreno suggests that equal-range students, for example residential consultants, monitor the page and help a student when posting too many status updates.
“You can’t solve a problem if you haven’t recognized it,” said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno’s co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
“We have found a way to identify endangered children who would not have been found otherwise.”
Facebook also constantly collects data from its own population.
The website's data team has created statistics about the relationship status and Valentine's Day, election participation in the inter-elections 2010 and a National Happiness Index (most of which were used to provide information that only Facebook has access to - Masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data base available to others for research purposes.)
However, the users of Facebook know that the site observes whether they want it or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site allows you to share your own personal information.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey they don’t even know anything about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offlinely, everything is allowed online.
“I don’t think many users have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles at all,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, for a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
“As for her, it was only about her and her friends.
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile and in posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
Social research needs to take care of social life, and a lot of social life still takes place offlinely.
‘Call and inhumane’: Anders Behring Breivik appears before a public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood two amoclusives in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a \"resistance\" fighter.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple-ridden Norway,” he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
“I raise opposition to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hateideologies and because of this, multiculturalism is supported.
“I recognize the laws, but I do not confess myself guilty.
Judge Torkhel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he “did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views”
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who gave a prewritten speech, the permission to turn to his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the Breivik police remain in custody for 12 more weeks, he had no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely control all visits and the entire correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in their eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind castle and belt.
Everyone took part with the goal that everything goes on to a road closure.
“I thought he was cold and inhumane,” a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
\"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I saw and heard the suspect.\"
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked quietly and professionally throughout the hearing. He looked at journalists and survivors as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre indication that he would be part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had been complicated.
Some may like that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of an individual extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically facilitate the cares and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
“I wish he would look like a monster, but he doesn’t,” a victim said.
“It would be so much easier if he did it.”
7 lessons of the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theatre this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford and highlighted the genius of technology as a great modern inventor.
What Apple fans may find most interesting in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was unveiled in the key markets this week, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and work processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed hippie, but he was also an accribic organizer who basked in charts - a man who believed that many managers suffer from \"a disease of thought\", \"that a really great idea is 90 percent of work... [but] there is a huge amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product\"
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series “Triumph of the Professional Idiots” about the breakup of the personal computer, and he sat together for more than an hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At the time, it had been 10 years since jobs were pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the wide adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in specialist ideas, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing during delivery.
Only after job death did a full VHS copy be discovered in the director's garage.
This easily revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film “Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview” that comes into the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to ignore detailed interviews, jobs here seem surprisingly engrossed in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
Over the course of the interview, there will be four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds after-suspends, in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments when jobs' perfectionism comes to the fore when he seems impatiently responds to Cringely’s questions and motivates him to engage more quickly in issues or by-actions of greater importance.
Prior to the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the lost interview appears to be somewhat mysterious if jobs evaluate what other companies do to their opinion correctly or incorrectly and represent their own vision of the future of the computer.
It’s a matter of reading posthumous ratings of career jobs’, but seeing jobs here as the enchanted dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is slightly different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things might and should be.
Soon after he had done all of this, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven notable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to run a company:
“During all the years in the business, I always ask: ‘Why do you do things’. And the answer you always get is: ‘Oh, so it’s done simply.’
No one knows why he is doing what he is doing. No one in the business really thinks about things.
I found that.
Jobs continues to make its efforts to rationalize accounting at Apple.
Astonishing how costs were recorded - usually started with standard costs - that were targeted on mere suspicion and then adapted with \"disruption\" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the smallest.
How the Pope was especially impressed:
Jobs tells of the blue box he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could be used to drag into the telephone company and lead long-distance conversations.
Much has been written about the device, but jobs enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-power, is infectious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a paid phone, making a call, and then connecting from an AT&T network to another one, while dragging through as many satellites as possible.
“We sent things half a dozen times around the globe, and when you grumbled on the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door,” he said.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn't know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs further tell of a glorious strike, the Wozniak and he almost withdrew when they called in the Vatican in the middle of the night through Blue Box and wanted to talk to the Pope, while as well they were able to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called back in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two had to strike loose before the pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
“It was the only company I had seen in my old age, and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees.
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company’s research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever produced.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang up on this machine and write programs for them.
How to Improve Innovations:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built some records, he was asked by a customer to build the entire computer together.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later on at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember pressing arguments... they yelled that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer.”
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About big companies that leave:
Long before he revived Apple, jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants were riding with their visions in Stolpern and lost control of their shares.
“We say you’re working with IBM or Xerox, so make a better copyer or printer, after and after.”
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [since it is such people] who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of the decision-making process.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is eliminated by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship is necessary.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, it could have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
They won the defeat of the victory.
About innovation as an art form:
“It’s a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it’s changing and growing.”
You learn a lot about his fines.
You have to make voting, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to notice 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Finally, it goes beyond taste, it goes beyond trying to put apart with the best stuff that humans have created and then try to bring these things together to what you are doing.
Picasso said good artists are copying great artists.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people working there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with opponents of health laws, as court accepts case
On the day when the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically sharing question of whether to listen to President Obama’s health laws, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the court to represent the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for testing.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a complaint raised by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of the health care system, which was decided by Congress last year, a law passed by conservative activists throughout the United States.
In fact, in March, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected, which is likely to increase the result of the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full motion at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer, who will stand before court and claim that the law is to kick, will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the government of George W. Bush.
Clements Kanzlei, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the federalist society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which opposes the law.
Another sponsor was the Pharmacy giant Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the process’s outcome.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had consulted about the case, at a Washington hotel.
Mitch McConnell, Republican Group Chief of Republicans in the Senate and a declared opponent of the Health Reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they did, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: “A judge may be able to take part in beneficial events by law and other organizations, where the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or a guest of such events according to the programme.”
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the companies associated with the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in this, was sufficient to alert moral and government activists.
“This amazing break with morality and the opposite of the code punishes the complaints of some judges lying, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
“The judges won and voted in court during a beneficial event with lawyers with floating proceedings.
Your appearance and support of a donation action for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would mix court affairs too easily with groups led by the Committee, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was an attorney-general under the Obama government when the first legislative battles came before the court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw himself from hearing the case because she was too committed to defending the law to be unprejudiced.
Kagan doesn't make any institutions to do this.
Boeing draws record order of $18 trillion in land
Airlines Emirates orders 50 two-way aircraft from Boeing 777 with an option to 20 other aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 billion.
It’s really a rare message that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big business when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft is total at a record total of $18 trillion.
Likewise unusual is the client of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $400 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest contract for commercial aircraft on weekends, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-way Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer job came from the Emirates airline from Dubai.
The airline has also announced that Boeing announced it in 2011 at the Dubai Aviation Show, an option on buying 20 other aircraft that will increase the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 billion.
“This is absolutely positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, Morningstar’s stock exchange expert.
“The quality of these special customers is very high.
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil producing countries.
So they don’t just have the money to pay for the aircraft. Rather, an increase in oil prices, which usually hurt the airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or shift aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have a natural assurance,” he said.
The ordering of Emirates renewed Boeing’s leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helped keep the Airbus competitor SAS in check, which attacked the pre-power position with the A350.
Boeing's victory on the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced it would move the introduction of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
One shifted the introduction to gain more trust after customers demanded a higher load and reach.
Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers have supported Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race for the governor post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo has won the race for the governor post in the western state from the Constitutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI.
“The intervention of organized crime during the entire election process and especially on the day of yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the entire country,” Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
“They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... they have occupied electoral cabinets, built roadblocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for PRI]”
The PRI ruled in Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just struck Claderon, who had led in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party PRD, the currently acting governor, came to the third, a severe defeat for the split and happy left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and amphetamine.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence still lasts.
A PAN civil servant was killed a week before the election during a election for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates went out of fear of local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how repulsive the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is probably represented by the PRI in the race for the Presidential Office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: “I think this victory will allow us to look bravely into the next year.”
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
Asia’s Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its heavy debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow Asia’s growth.
Rajat Nag, Director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world — all in their power — must do to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) who are looking at the difficulties in Europe “in a lack of leadership” and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources through Asia will help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We’re all on the same boat.
“So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis,” he said to the Financial Times in an interview at the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to a certain degree, but it is not immune.”
\"If China and India can help, then with all the means.\"
Europe’s monetary union has been in a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest rates have increased dangerously, and the Prime Minister, both from Italy and Greece, has resigned.
The emerging heavy debt crisis in Europe raises fears that the global economy could collapse and lead to calls for the leading emerging countries to meet to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support Asia will be channeled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stabilization Facility (EFSF) - would offer greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Commerce, said that “India will do everything in its power to help the eurozone, as the own economy is now suffering from falling exports and drying out foreign capital flows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We face big challenges and we have to get a high level of growth.”
\"It's not an option, it's an assignment, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women.\"
Others argue that developing economies like India do not allow themselves to help rich Europeans if they face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the U.S. Brown University, said it would be extremely difficult to sell the 1.2 trillion people in India to help Europe, of which more than 800 million of them live or even less per day.
“At some point they will find out that the Greeks are going to retire with 50 and spend vacations on the beach. Then you have a problem,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India’s reserves should be used to maintain the numerous and well-paid public service employees in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, losing facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said the crises in the eurozone will have “significant domino effects” across Asia.
ADB’s forecast with an economic growth of 7.5% in Asia for the years 2011/threats “the risk of classification” due to the threatening threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets had to create “crisis plans” to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital migration of their words.
urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in defense
Defence Minister Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security without notice, triggering a financial chain response from the Pentagon's halls to the war scene in Afghanistan and the civilian flow bands.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of $ 450 trillion over the coming decade, but now fears that further cuts will be necessary by $600 trillion or more if Congress cannot complete the expenditure.
“The effects of these cuts would be devastating to the ministry,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure of Congress in reaching a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead to 23% general cuts as well as a halt to numerous new projects.
“Like a high shortfall, carried out in such an careless manner, most of our ship and construction projects would make it impossible to carry out — you can’t buy three quarters of a ship or building — and other modernisation efforts seriously damage,” Panetta wrote to the Senators.
“We would also be forced to voluntarily separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian staff and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave with security of border probability civilians in order to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness.”
In the end, the cuts were made to meet the fighting forces, Panetta said.
“While the wartime contingents in the anti-terror campaign are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would negatively affect war efforts,” Panetta warned.
“Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in attitudes and attitude oversight that support the war,” he said.
\"The staff's salaries would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime traders and the legal and political support would be disrupted.\"
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defense.
“The consequences of the arrest of the Ministry of Defense would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as a leading military force in the world.”
“We are vehement to this draconian action,” said the Senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta’s letter.
“This is a result we can’t live with, and it’s certainly not that we should be pushed.”
“The arrest is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its entry should not be permitted.
Whether Panetta’s letter and the Senators’ new warnings will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or strengthen demands to take out the Pentagon of cuts remains to be expected.
Panetta has increasingly expressed the possible shortcomings, although he could gather many years of experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defense painted a dark picture of what might occur - a military with a shell, but without a core.
\"It's a ship without a mattress.\"
\"It's a brigade without ammunition.\"
“It’s an air-weapons squad without sufficiently trained pilots.
“It’s a paperteller, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission,” Panetta said in his opening address in the Pentagon.
“It is a force that lacks morals and alertness and that is unable to capture it with potential opponents.”
“It’s actually getting angry,” he said.
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details on how reductions “significantly create operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global ability to use and adapt, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects of the strike could fall to the victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If you stop the further development and testing of the F35, this would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but the advocates say it is an important next step to upgrade so that potential dangers can be banned by China and other opponents.
How to denounce a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how dangerous and widespread deception and lying are in daily life.
The presidential candidate of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is busy becoming master of the charges of sexual harassment on the part of several women.
The management of Penn State is accused of mynid, as reports have been held back after a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was included when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself a fool when he brought about allegations that were very quickly dismissed by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards will be charged with the violation of campaign funding, which is related to the hiding of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circles that caused President Bill Clinton when he lied to Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with him.
Stories about smuggling in school and college tests are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers gave their students the test answers so that they could be successful even in their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite are sending a message that lies and smuggling are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies show, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
Many of these lies, however, are considered to be lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Identifying lies or “discovering lies” is a thing that is important for every person, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a society game, such as scraading, in which it is the goal to call “Hab you,” detaining a deception is a serious knowledge area based on scientific data collected at well-respected universities over the past six decades, which carried out far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most ancient myths were revealed about the lie.
Lies look into one's eyes.
They don't always stumble, strain, rot, and gnash.
However, it is not to be concluded from this that these liars are hard to discover and detain.
A practicer of lying can penetrate the truth by learning something about the structure of the assertion, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years examining the scientific results of the extensive and constantly growing area of detoxification, and it is clear that detoxifying a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us in finding the right place in our complex world, especially if the setting up or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration belongs to our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people’s interests and controlling their own emotions, and they feel intuitive as they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people, that men are more often “self-oriented” lies than women whose lies are more “oriented to others” - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly “fat lies”)
We also know that if a person has been revealed as a wrongdoer, others feel less guilty of having this person logged in.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called “baselining” the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent assessment of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your trial person.
You should know better when someone is usually constantly tripping with the foot, so they don’t accuse him of being wrong if he is tripping with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to the accumulation of obvious verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these mounts as alarm bells that scream, not as evidence of detainment.
People who deceive may hesitate when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet point to the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way, or show a “resatisfaction after the setting conversation” this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Questioners often falsely signal that an setting conversation is over, just to keep an eye on this relaxation after the setting conversation.
Also pay attention to the language of your trial person.
Scott Peterson’s expatriator is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive people can also use a depressing language: \"I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky - or if you repeat a clumsy question overall.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use \"qualifying language\" when they answer a delicate question: \"Now...to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... according to best knowledge and conscience.\"
As a result, the answer becomes more discernible than physical, which often causes the alarm bells to scream.
There is no magic means of denouncing lies, but one can learn skills that are possible thanks to those who are able to detain them.
Thanks to these skills, everyone can become a rare victim of fraud, both in private and in professional life.
Controversy plan of an oil pipeline is revised after threat due to delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay Canada’s approval of a planned oil pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico, which would make the unions angry and at the same time calm environmentalists, the pipeline-building company is trying to re-plan the project so that you can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the parliamentary building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company is still confident that the pipeline will ultimately be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal permit for the project would be submitted until the new possible course was reviewed, which avoided a large underwater supply of sandhills in Nebraska as well as Ogallala aquifer.
“This is a real step forward,” Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review, which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has arranged, may present a decision until 2013, following the elections in the coming year, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama declared last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said its support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta Province to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline had to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them, because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the lawmakers Nebraskas, who oppose the plan, consider the laws to force a departure from the Sandhills and Ogallala Aquifer region, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the ministry’s environment has found that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy says that the chief auditor of the ministry requested a separate probe of the review procedure, focusing on two questions.
One is whether a lobbyist set up by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's advisor in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company assigned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of having forced a baby out of fear of breaking
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have been given a towel attack, which would have put her little daughter so in fear that she would surrender herself to fear.
The “Lady Marmalade” singer, 18-month-old Genevieve Monk, was so afraid that she was suffering from “personality changes, sleep disorder” and “greater fear of strangers,” her family told the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, wanted to break up a kindergarten, and Genevieve to a family vacation.
While Kevin Monk was getting the car, Roseanna Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on the arm into the lobby in her building on the Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter off for a moment.
“Someone appeared behind me and said, ‘Know what your daughter is doing right now, I said, ‘Yes’ and went to take her back to the arm,’ she said.
LaBelle urged the pregnant woman to be angry.
“She said in an aggressive tone: “You shouldn’t put your daughter near the door,” Roseanna Monk said.
“I said to her, “It doesn’t interest me what you say or think.”
She became angry and started to chimp - she used the F word and the A word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to kick water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would become hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘See what you have done with my daughter,’ the mother of the child said.
LaBelle fell to the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on the arm, and had to be held back by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby cried so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology, but received no answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls for an opinion.
The complaint is about an unspecified compensation, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he does not charge an honorary and the family plans to donate the money they receive from child cancer aid.
“We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior,” Davis said.
“This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially if it is placed in front of a kindergarten girl who wears an 18-month-old baby on her arm.
Climate conflicts have slowed down the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is at the government, unemployment and black labor in Sinaloa increased while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
It is the first year in the history of Sinaloas that Mario López Valdez, who calls himself the initiator of change and has given up great hopes for economic growth, is in the government, but as a result of climate contradictions, growth cannot be the reason, but rather the most important economic indicators.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in millions in agriculture, but also caused the growth of the state economy close borders and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter of the year, mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which impacted on other economic sectors.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of frost, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land mines were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially affected.
In the first quarter of the year, the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid rise in unemployment, as from January to March, 55,053 people in Sinaloas had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the unemployment population. In the second quarter, unemployment rates rose to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa, which is 18 969 people more than in the first quarter.
Reduced Liquidity
The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented that the policy of public institutions indirectly supports the growing unemployment.
“What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, it is not easy to let liquidity losses on the market by means of legislation that has been adopted to combat money-wasting in Congress, because for those who are buying prohibited dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves to invest or use them for anything else,” he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
“The number of people who leave the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined, on the one hand, due to the entry problems and, on the other hand, because it’s difficult to find work there. These people stay here and look for work here, which gives rise to unemployment,” he says.
Black Labour
Analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if you take into account the high proportion of black labor, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38 percent of the workers working in the country without paying in the cash of social insurance.
For unemployment and black labor, low wages, lowest in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Governmental Authority for Labour and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos by September, which is much less than the total average of the total population of 7375 pesos.
The decline of ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and increasing unemployment, the largest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía (state economic authority), the ADI was $630 597 from January to June, which corresponds to a swing of 87.74 percent compared to the $5143,312 in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Authority for Economic Development) listed a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, which comes mainly from companies from the tertiary sector.
The debt
In view of the economic crisis, the national government requested a loan of 3,000 000 000 pesos in July at the National Congress to be invested in the 18 municipalities to reactivation the economy in infrastructure projects. The national convention approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but by November no positive impact of debt on any of the countries in the country could be determined.
_Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship, the first year of government, Mario López Valdé's government failed.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of the Processing Industry in Mexico) said that no efforts were made to reach a consensus on the views of the different sectors, including the national government, in 2011.
“The economic activity in Sinaloa was very expensive this year. It has to be worked hard to recover the lost territory this year and in 2012 we have to make a double effort. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the well-informed government team have not been sufficiently coordinated,” he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events, such as the frost at the beginning of the year, made the country’s economic development difficult and slowed down.
“The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not sufficiently moving to create an economic dynamics that could create an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. That is why we will close the year far below our expectations,” he said.
Redefined vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana in Sinaloa, declared that it would be necessary to make the state more dynamic productive activities.
“In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to re-determine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources Sinaloas,” he said.
There is a lot to do
The chairman of Coparmex emphasized the importance of developing a future perspective that leads the efforts of the government to better paths.
“In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas, and economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme,” he said.
He emphasized that the current state power has made progress in government.
“There are areas where we can say that the government has acted more extensively. What I can say is that it has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it,” he said.
arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A population of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The state prosecutor of the Republic announced that the drug retailer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the property of marijuana intended to trade.
In accordance with Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican military forces on 7 June 2010 while monitoring the Cipriano Valdez road against the Watchpost No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug retailer drove in a white delivery car where he held a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the seized goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the criminal is still in the executive body.
Debts for construction work
Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 social buildings for migrants are at risk of not being completed due to lack of resources or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The head of the urban authority for social development explained that although the construction programmes are already advanced, they are now in jeopardy, since the government has not paid the funds it has to exceed for the three programmes 11 million peso.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. So far, only the Federación and the municipality had been responsible for the construction of funds, which is why a delay in the construction of the building was expected.
“12 million have to assist, and although the year has already ended, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they had to pay us a part in July, he said, “To not be too late, we have already started construction work, and they have already advanced far, but we need the money”
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state had not fulfilled its obligations, which was why the community had to take up a 7 million-dollar loan at the beginning of its reign, corresponding to the amount the central government had to pay.
“We had already done so in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to make the resources that the state had not imposed to participate in these programmes.
Even if the state authorities are obliged to pay off these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance was asked to speed up administrative work and pay off the outstanding share as soon as possible.
“At least 12 million of them have to assist, and although the year has already ended, they have not given us a penny.”
The Court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The transformation of analogs to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Court, and forces the switching of analogs to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to contest the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the legislative decree detailing the shift to terrestrial digital television.
With this decision, the constitutional dispute raised by the Senate was rejected, since it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes in order for the Court to decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission on Telecommunications in Mexico), the Act would contradict the hierarchical principles and the law enforcement of the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Federal Commission on Telecommunications in Mexico) in the project for the complaint drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero.
In favour of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted themselves.
Following the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the decree of the law and set up all activities for the establishment of digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Representatives without entering into the debate on the project, which was also responsible for Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister said that he would not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government is not allowed to regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by general regulations.
\"I also don't think that if you did that, it would affect the independence of the regulatory body - it also reminds you that, for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, because this leads the state affairs.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place in recent years around the world, and it produces better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The move forward, she said, is a suspension of the use of digitization, which is a decision in the public interest that has not only technical points of view, \"because it includes economic, social, political and security aspects.\"
These matters, they emphasized, \"made the entire system necessary, in accordance with the principle of economic leadership by the state, they included a group of characteristics which laid down the constitution in the hands of the central government.\"
She recalled that many countries around the world have already carried out the digital transformation, even though they have highly specialized institutions.
It is not possible to conclude that the government would take into the jurisdictions of Congress with the issue of the contested decree, because the laws adopted by the legislature would comply, she assured.
The possibility of counting the vote in Michoacán individually is taken into consideration
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor’s election is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of the individual count of the vote is a reality in the Michoacán elections this year, because according to the data issued by the Programmea de Resultados Electorale Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the Governoral elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded us that just last November, the electorate had adopted a number of arrangements on the benchmark of local regulations with the reforms of the States in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had adapted neither his political constitution nor his electoral law or law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by Congress so that they had not entered into force during this round of elections.
On November 9th, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint submitted by the local legislature and voted the vote of the State Officer on the constitutional reforms as “unvaluable and unlawful, since it does not have the right to decide on it or to impose a veto against it.
María de los Ángeles Llanderal, in an interview on the possibility of individual counting of votes, explained that thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there was now the possibility that the local electoral authority could partially or completely count the vote.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted The results in the protocols do not agree; the protocol on voting and calculation is not currently available or it is not owned by the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the protocols.
In addition, the total count of the fully-filled ballots may take place if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the one in second place, which is equal or lower than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session, there is an explicit request by the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the candidates mentioned.
The voting bill may also take place in its entirety if, after completion of the proper calculation, it is determined that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided there is an explicit application by a party representative whose candidate has become second. In this case, the electoral packages which have been exposed to a partial count would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is almost 0.16%, although the votes of 129 of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived at Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday.
According to family members, the last will of the lieutenant was that his ashes would spread across the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others who died in the accident, returned to the capital city of Coahuila on a plane from the Mexican Air Force, and the next person to the Colonel took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At twelve o'clock in the afternoon, the ashes of the superintendent landed on the mourning hall, located at the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family and friends came from.
At 5:30 p.m., his remains were examined at Saltillo's Technical Institute, and this body show was accompanied by his former colleagues from the technical abitur and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, during his preparation for graduation.
“He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would spread over the Zapalinamé Mountains, which he had always said to his family and friends — told Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
From her point of view, the superintendent had fulfilled all his dreams and she felt that he had been in the fullness of his life. “He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother, and he always stood up for his family.”
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Luftwaffe of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't hold it because they thought it would even get him on a truck, but he always tried to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. \"He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he took Martha Sahagún to Saltillo.
The young man remembers that he had even been driven to Zapopán at the age of seven to graduate his family member, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what pleased him best: an airplane flew.
A last farewell
Their honor was granted to the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military Area, the Mexican Air Force, School Director and Students of Saltillo's Technical Education Institute, where he studied in 1985 and enjoyed both study and sports as excellent.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter that he had flown down, in which Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons were sitting out of the same authority, crashed.
At 18.05 a.m., the established remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, met to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the front of the barracks by the compensation company, where he was already expecting his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, Cristina, his mother, siblings and other members, pupils and teachers.
The abandoned bodies were found on a property at the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the fund, military officials presented to the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same locality in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by shots in different parts of the body and a grace committee in an abandoned Finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at the kilometerpoint 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several predecessors saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood sperrangel wide.
As they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons within about three meters, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another dressed with a white top.
Nearly one meter away was the body of another person with red t-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the belly.
According to the information received on site, the three persons must have been murdered in another place because no cartridge sleeves were found.
On the wall of the country house are inscriptions that write an organized criminal gang to another, as well as several committees were found in the wall and door.
11 people in Cadereyta arrested
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (Secretary of State for State Defense) presented 11 persons, including a minor who were part of a criminal gang that was mainly in the town of Cadereyta, and who are associated with kidnappings, murders, halconeo (human hunt) and secret funerals.
According to the information made public, eight persons were first arrested in the settlement of Los Alveros on 11 November and a prisoner was released.
Three real estates and a mobile phone were guaranteed. The arrested confirmed to be members of the criminal group Los Zetas.

On Wednesday, formation of the new Italian government
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the President of Italy to present this the new government, which is to offer the crisis that Italy has caused on the brink of economic collapse.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the President of Italy to present this the new government, which is to offer the crisis that Italy has caused on the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with the President of the State, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm the formation of government.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will join his office.
Monti said he would present to the state president the results of talks with the political parties on government education.
“I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country’s ability to deal with these difficult times,” the former EU Commissioner told the journalists.
Monti did not expressly confirm the formation of government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles are overcome.
“The frame is now well sealed,” he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, has to adopt a hard savings package requested by the euro politicians to regain the trust in Italy.
The pressure to speed up Monti was further reinforced by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which the Italian state bonds were charged with 7 percent interest rates for 10 years, corresponding to the state in which Greece and Ireland saw themselves forced to apply for the European Rescue Screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industrial association ConfiIndustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: “We said we would support this government after all the forces”
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency situation.
The success opportunities of Montis were significantly increased by the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
“We believe that the Professor Monti’s efforts are intended to bring good results,” said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Mid-Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, for so far many of its members have spoken out against a majority of technocrats-based government, which Monti has just formed.
Parliament's support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular savings measures.
Resistance to its efforts or the delay of reform could again cause a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks, with its indication that a failure of Montis is a disaster, also pressure.
Monti started on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurs, as well as with youth and women’s organizations.
Tuesday evening the session is to be completed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, in response to the crisis, launched an extremely fast change of government.
After a brief breath by the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, because of the uncertainty over the success of the new Prime Minister, the costs of Italian state bonds have again reached critical limits.
A rescue of Italy with a debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said his government would have to wait until the next elections expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should only consist of technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure of financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and the disagreements between the parties make the inclusion of people from political life complicated.
Spaniards have more games than the Ticos
Of the 22 players released from Spain, 10 have over 50 international games on the buckle.
From the Costa Ricas side, only one of the 22 invocations has 50 games behind it.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 for the friendship game that takes place today at 15:05 am at the National Stadium of San José, players from both countries are compared.
While the world and Europe champions, number one on FIFA’s monthly ranking, can look back at a considerable number of Class A selection games, the three-colored team only has the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have every year the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (liga and cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Furie at the Eurocup and the World Football Championships is difficult to escape.
On the other hand, the Tico footballers have few international encounters within the context of the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA rankings at the bottom.
We will see how the Spanish team draws their last register: the Torwart Iker Casillas, who reached an equal level with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (Down 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-colored team today and Spain will have a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi received even last week’s recognition from UEFA, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magical number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle towers of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds also approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He followed Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side towers Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five came on over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Those with the least games.
Fewer than 30 games feature Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the side of the national team come to fewer than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest does not even approach the 20s limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson had not yet their debut.
The historical goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has shot with nine most goals, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett joined Costa Rica in his tour of celebrating his twenty years of existence.
“To play in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true.”
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts the next Sunday at the national stadium.
For more than 20 years, they have been expected, but the band assures them that a dream is realized for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This assured the group’s bassist and co-founder, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva from Brazil an exclusive interview last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their twenty years of existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, from 19:30 p.m., they will be at the National Stadium together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the conversation, whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is the second time that we are playing in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've just been on vacation in Costa Rica. It's such a beautiful country that we'll definitely stay there for a few more days.
For us, it is exciting to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely out of the band, and they experience the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for being on our side all these years.
We took almost 21 years until we got to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry to have used so long until we got here.
Some people even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn’t that a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the most amazing shows we’ve had in the last 21 years took place in the last two weeks.
We have played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we have made fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are excited by the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to surf for Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Along with Mexico, the excellent areas for surfing are, in this way, about people who love surfing, we have learned about it.
With a view to the tour, you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we do not set limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Each one likes another song, so that the decision we'll play each one doesn't fall easily.
If we include two or three songs that we haven't played any longer, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they call us the reasons why we liked those songs. Otherwise they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore, also for the audience.
This tour will celebrate your twenty years of history.
When you look back, is it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, all right.
At first, I think that none of us have ever imagined playing in a great rock band, and that's for more than 20 years.
We also put on these blessings and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like and are excited about producing music.
We are lucky to be able to travel to the places of the world we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't stand better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of big bands.
We are good with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement comes out of a group of friends.
Time and again, a band comes out of a city, but it’s already unusual when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw soundgarden on their tour. We are still happy to be with them all and we are honored to be part of this raised Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) died 13 years ago. This alone is a lot more time than many bands last.
At first, I think we all appreciate being alive and caring for each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical ways have opened up for each individual to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music, and we couldn't go better.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy, on the other hand, you could always do what you wanted, thanks to your success.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew up made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too often on tour, as it is too easy to drop this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you think people have come because of music, this reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has brought into your life without having to be a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andrew Woods.
We were disappointed at having used it for so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us, befriended. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a joy to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we missed him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and have the band therefore chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band pleased us best. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I don't know.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing that happens to him.
Who are you influenced by as a bassist?
From so many+
Among the first to attack me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists who liked me.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it was no longer a fashion appearance?
I think we all feel not very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, the bands that I mentioned before, for example, Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who came up at the same time, are also important today, I think it’s great because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
That’s interesting because I think there are a few songs on the new album that could work somewhat easily, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in themselves.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed playing them, and they were very dark songs.
I believe that if you get older and something tragic has happened in your life - e.g. if you lose a family member or a friend - this affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs embody that clearly to me.
However, I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was sent to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who for 25 years is imprisoned for violations of human rights during his period of government (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is operated four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congressman and his personal doctor, told the television that Fujimori would investigate for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that in Fujimori’s opinion, for humanitarian reasons, he did not wish this because he thought he was innocent.
He has been operated on tongue cancer four times and has lost 18 kilos of weight, including further diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the abdominal gland, kidney stones, high blood pressure and bleeding problems in the legs.
Fujimori has been located in Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruvian army, which was secretly operating during his time of government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official appointment, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, begins their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between two countries and discuss the region’s political issues
Mujica will meet with his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón on Wednesday, according to the Uruguayan president, the highlight of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the group of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara \"is suitable for the exchange of information on all political areas between the two countries\" announced the Presidential Office of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica was looking for the support of Calderóns regarding the incident with France when French government chief Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax paradises at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still appear to be a tax paradise from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request from his ambassador to the European country.
Since November, Mexico has held the presidency of the G20, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and industrial countries in the world, and since January this year, an agreement has been made on the exchange of tax information to avoid double exposure to the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the concretisation of agreements for the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the “gray list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not introduced all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
Since 2004 there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The Snoring Bearded Installer enters the third dimension with “Super Mario 3D Country”
Super Mario has been tireless for 25 years about the salvation of Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but so far never in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D country, he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which comes this month to the store counters of all over the world, has been tailored from the beginning to the properties of the portable console Nintendo 3DS, which can be played three-dimensional without any special glasses.
“Mario is the figure who has to tell how stereoscopy works without glasses,” said Omar Álvarez, responsible for the Spanish press specializing in Nintendo when presenting the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that “Super Mario 3D Land” was Nintendo’s first video game, which was developed for this console from the beginning, because so far success articles such as “Star Fox 64 3D” or “Zelda: Ocarine of Time 3D” were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo’s spokesperson stressed that although it was three-dimensional, “Super Mario 3D Land” is an affordable video game that allows for a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that “Super Mario 3D Country” contained two games in one: The first part is “light” to capture the less-skilled users.
After that, the experts can turn a \"second round\" over the various legs of games that are becoming more and more difficult.
In addition, in real time, users can choose between an “aggressive D” or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles, without becoming victims of the “optic effects,” they must always be played three dimensionally.
This trip to the three-dimensional world of Super Marios also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo adds to Saga’s fans and repeats the success of the last editions: The snorkeling-bearer must overcome the platforms that have been spotted with dangers in order to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in the movements, environment, clothing and enemies — and a playable — Luigi.
Colom for the extradition of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would take place the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo, so that he would be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy to waste $70 million.
The process ends on the request of the United States for the extradition of Portillo so that it can be brought before the court there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of judicial violence and government taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He emphasized that during his government he did not interfere in court decisions and made any extradition requests he was notified of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and severe body injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The conduct of Coloms is a act of government that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to condemn the former President of State (2000-2004).
According to the rulings of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered if his legal situation is clarified in Guatæle and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his time of government, and this negotiations preceded the extradition, but the minister submitted a contradiction and witnessed the case new.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization has been called on to prevent the marginalization of young people without professional training.
The first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social aid organization have led to important results: during this quarter century, 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, the more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people participated, was drawn to a balance sheet yesterday.
Trinijove was launched in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with a low level of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
At the yesterday celebration in Sant Andreu, numerous representatives of institutions and institutions participated in working with the association during these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions at election times demonstrated the impartiality of the work carried out by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (parliamentary of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and former mayor and currently left-wing city council Ricard Goma.
The large Hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister of Social and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas emphasized that Trinijove was brought into existence in very difficult times and that today’s times are not less complicated, but he added that the work that has been done so far is “a good foundation.”
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives people hope in difficulties.
“The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it is doing,” he said.
Occupied house, in which huge parties were performed, was sent out
The owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes Street No. 51 (Barcelona).
The 12 owners left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 on the Balmes road have found an end.
At noon, 12 persons volunteered to leave the building, which they had illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair.
After the spaciousing, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
\"From now on, access will be controlled - the house manager confirmed.
The homeowners, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest of which were inhabited - took the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply. In addition, they had painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans with alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
In addition to the building, there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also carried damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that her business had declined by 80% since the start of the house occupation.
The owner of the discothek pointed out that the houseowners made their unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros while they cost 10 euros in the discothek.
In addition, the owner of the leisure site was shown by the neighbors due to restlessness, while according to their statement the noise was not caused by the visitors of the disco, but by the homeowners and in particular by the guests of the feasts organized there, and which, according to statements of the angry neighbors in recent weeks, have become more and more and longer.
The discothek’s manager explained that the harassment had been so great that she agreed with the owner of the building that for the last nine months, she had to pay no rent.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that they have received more complaints from the neighbors in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular People's Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked the building to be demolished immediately last week and to get the problems of civil cohabitation and the city district arrival.
He explained that just one floor of the building had been occupied by the summer, but that in the last few months, the owners had been forced into all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments.
In this sense, he added that \"it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to intervene against the asocial actions in the building.\"
Yesterday another building in the Nou Barris district was built by the Catalan police.
At 15:30 p.m., the police approached Montral Street 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or Mountain?
The architects, apart from the disputes over the Honorares, agree to the tender.
The urban aid over the 16 goals opens up the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the peak of the now-lost Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its sarcasm on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure describes the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers to the Central Park of New York.
With the decline of the CMB in 1987, the park became the top of Barcelona again, as the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that spread not north-south, but up (mountains) and down (more).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
The Central Park now no longer served as a model, but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of the Yogi bear.
As far as the city was concerned, when the city issued a huge award in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access stores to Collserola.
There is no doubt a gate to the concept of a park.
Either this is the case, or someone has suggested putting goals on the land.
The question is of itself: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The request is not only from an organizational point of view, but also from a reflection on the city, the subject of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring topic that two members of this old instigated caste who meet in the elevator.
And exactly this fact provides the substance for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, it is necessary to talk about the \"front of the mountains\" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been carried out over the green apples, is concerned.
“One should assume from the principle that Barcelona’s biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex - judging the architect for which the title \"Tore of Collserola - a lexical case - is: they must not be presented as access to a park, but as a limitation of areas on which they must be traded -
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal to be a \"intellectual challenge - the \"some dangers\".
Risks due to the 'uncertainty that today brings about the design of a public space - according to the experiences of the 1980s that had their 'swane singing' in the field of the forum.
The first fear is its own limitation on what may be built.
“Something to limit always means to take the next step — i.e. to exceed it.
“You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [related to the General Metropolitan (PGM) plan] can lead to a real disaster.”
Modol, who is more concerned with the question, simply means that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, “can be understood as a park that is not towards Barcelona, for purely topographic reasons.
Modol remembers that there is already a study by the Patronate de Collserola, which should not \"stumble on deaf ears - although he is grateful to the city administration that it has given his body the opportunity to participate in this project \"from the first moment\".
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city of the letter of guidance that allows architects to participate in the debate, even though he expresses his “questions” as to whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams that have been established in life “just the right one,” he says, “we architects should be just a tool.”
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, since a global view of Collserola is failing in the conditions of aid: “There have been 16 competitions on the cross-section,” he says, “on the axis of mountain seas, but there are no long-range perspectives that view the area in its entirety.
This has at least led to his participating in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, creating a soft transition between the city and the green areas.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the Agent of the Casino Red freed Monterrey’s brother from the trial that is being carried out against him because of alleged extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the official of the Casino Red has given him the trial against Monterrey’s brother for extortion before the District’s Second Criminal Court.
After the assassination at the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is likely to force him to pay a fine so that the city administration would approve the secret operation of the betting house.
After the criminal notice, the prosecutor opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the panistic mayor, who was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 and Delitos Patrimoniales, he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He stayed in this place 49 days after a second arrest warrant after the Ministerio Público had committed the crimes for bribery and organized crimes.
On 19 October, he was transferred to the detention facility of Cadereyta because he had allegedly bribed the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos, but he stayed only a few hours in the middle safety tract, as there were threats of murder against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court proceedings as an inmate of the urban prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, issued an arrest order to him, stating that after nearly two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to blame Jonás for paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house to open it in return.
This Monday, the Agent of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez asked the judge José Luis Pecina to accept the sentence to the mayor’s brother, which is why he will be put on free foot in the next few hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, García Gómez, asked if he had fixed the damage and who the owner of the betting house had pronounced his forgiveness.
In accordance with Annex 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is free to speak, and no claims against the process can be filed below, nor will any compensation be required.
After hearing the deputy of the betting house at 15.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately put on free foot.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, drove to the urban prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and would lay his case to the files.
He also informed him of the judicial arrangement for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announced details about the plane crash in which the Secretary of State Francisco Blake and other seven people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretary of Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation results about the accident in which the Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people were killed indicate that the helicopter has been directly pricked against the ground with its entire unharmed structure without the pilot having been able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed prior to launch that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
“The matter of the propeller wing having contact with trees at 25 meters in height, with the helicopter losing the hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts,” he said.
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he met all the requirements for the transport of the personnel.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found in the investigation in the area where the machine came down.
“In the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the storage covered the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a recess of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is important to get the investigation results as soon as possible, but they can take several months, perhaps even a year.
His side assured Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for aircraft and auxiliary services in Mexico), that the helicopter had flown from the Estado Mayor Presidential when the plane hit at a speed of travel and fell on a soft slope.
“This information strengthens the assumption that at the time of the blast it was a normal flight operation —
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be considered in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In line with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the flight of sight, which meant that the team had to have a sufficient view during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the further flight towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State, some deep-hanging clouds emerged.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds, the team had selected a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Explosion point:
The blast coordinators and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Perhaps there has been no loss of control over the plane before the blast or a deviation from the flight route.
Spreading the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available until the present time indicates that the helicopter was blown up from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter had been blown onto the ground with its unscathed structure.
No indication of fire or explosion:
The remains of the plane offer at the accident site do not allow any fire or explosion to close.
The latest investigation results indicate several ground contacts.
In the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is depleted and has a gravitation of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably went to break.
Some information suggests that the helicopter might have had several ground contacts.
After a minimal search in an area that went beyond the blocked area at the accident site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforced the assumption that the unscathed aircraft structure had been broken against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol for finding the gene for obesity
It is a social insurance institution in Mexico that is conducting a research project on finding the gene of obesity in children and young people supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is conducting a research project to discover the gene of obesity in children and adolescents under the title \"Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth\" with which the genetic markers should be found in conjunction with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course at Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can get to the sports venues of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are conducted every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He emphasized that the investigation began at the sport square of Cuauhtémoc (west of the state of México) and will continue on the sports grounds of Nezahualcóyolt (east of the state of México) since October 8.
If the target of 500 to 600 investigators is reached, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Square (south of the capital district) and will be completed at the Morelos (northern district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to identify the factors and role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and identifying risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he explained that it is expected that three thousand children and young people aged six to 14 should be filled with the understanding and oversight of their parents’ nutrition-related questionnaires.
You will also ask questions about their physical activity and their family disease history to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He further stated that on Saturdays the examiners measured (weight, size, waist size), their blood pressure controlled and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (search for the identification of genes related to obesity in childhood) would be determined.
Cruz López emphasized that this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the health staff's concern over the alarming weight gain of young people.
“The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 found that in almost six years the proportion of obesity boys increased by 77 percent and the girls with obesity increased by 47 percent.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was founded because the genetic history of the population of Mexico was different from the other peoples.
He stated that a (e) Mexican (in) average of 65 percent of Indian-American, 30 percent of European and 5 percent of African descent, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity express themselves in the inability to burn the excess of the energy taken to us (calorians) so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefits to the examiners were in a comprehensive child examination in which it would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and in the inner arm (akanthosis) that indicate the probability of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and informed to parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all measurement results and suggest changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three basic factors that are responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, that is, lack of movement in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transportation rather than going short distances.
The high carbon intake, that is, increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbohydrates (Tamals, bread, pizza, Hamburger, etc.), along with high fat and protein intake, as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents stroke holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM developed with polymers modified asphalte to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
Would it not be necessary to repair almost 200,000 holes if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the Valley of Mexico) broke out, Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warned and assured that if the layout and maintenance of the Asphalt Laag were deemed appropriate, the number of holes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture “Slagholes from a technical point of view” which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, which he is responsible for, developed modified asphalte with polymers, to produce a mixture similar to the Asphalt, but which has greater mechanical resistance both at high and low temperatures.
Mr. Nájera said this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, in order to improve the behavior of the road burden and thus avoid the occurrence of hit holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound of which some of it has a high molecular weight - the so-called aspholds - and the other part a low - the so-called malthenes. Together, they give the road burden its characteristic toelastic behavior.
Tehelastic behavior of the Asphalt means that it behaves at high temperatures of almost 180° C. like a liquid, at 120° C. it is very delicate and at 50° C. it is almost fixed, while it is broken at very low temperatures.
“This means that the resistance of the Asphalt on the streets is not uniform, but is changing one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations,” the chemical engineer said.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City had mostly a flexible road burden composed of six layers of material, the last of which included three asphalts.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer made of asphalt, which is made of small, asphalted stones and then solidified stones.
Each individual stone of this wearing layer, has been coated in Asphalt.
If the vehicles are moving on and forces are generated, this layer allows for good power distribution in the street area.
“If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed,” said the chemical engineer.
“On the wear layer,” he said, “a last layer is laid out, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. of sand, which has also been grounded in Asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they need to produce friction.
Those of this street light receive and distribute most of the forces, the support layer also needs an adequate thickness and the material from which it consists must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular moisture and temperature fluctuations, are other factors to be considered, above all, the water, he said, “because it significantly affects the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain is moistened, water penetrates the layer and only occurs hard again. This causes a wave of all the layers of the road cover and as a result the appearance of impact holes.
When a impact hole arises, he said, “the cover layer is first worn off, while the wear layer is only affected after that. But the damage does not occur immediately, but is a process that has to be maintained in the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs.”
The member in the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause of the occurrence of shock holes, which is why the thickness of each layer of the road load should always be in relation to the vehicle load and it should be ensured that this regulation is followed to avoid frequent impact holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many other research works were still waiting, for example, on Asphaltemulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which the shock holes could be repaired simply and without application high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that led to Melina Ramírez Serna not receiving the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th mistitle.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went empty when he gave the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to stand on the winning stage, to show a silver crown and the band she designated Miss Colombia.
With the result received that night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department has already reached 14 mistitles and Melina has joined the Legion of Women from Valle del Cauca, who had held the crown almost in their hands. These include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987)), Leila Blanque Consula Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo Edit, Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many people ask today is: What is missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite, who had shown in every performance that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not without reason she was elected as the Queen of Police and the Major Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered crucial to the jury’s decision to call it the First Miss is that she did not believe the answer to the question “Which Book has influenced you the most and why” that was put to her by Martín Murillo Gómez of Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questioner:
“I read a lot, I think pretty much to the literature, I think it’s a kind of civilizing myself, finally I think the book, which was the strongest for my childhood, ‘The Little Prince’, is a pretty deep going book.
I’m currently reading ‘Should and Sühne’. It’s a book of universal culture that we should all read. I’m just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book that ‘Leidenschafts’.
A response that was to little hostility, first because of the term `sich civilize' and second because she had not specifically explained how every book she mentioned had influenced her.
But after the ceremony, Melina explained that she felt calm and happy with the result: “The universe is wise, it happens what needs to happen.
And for all people, please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the lover of El Valle has been burned out.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that she was the one who was the one who held all of the condolences and who had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy competition Easter, audience agreement on the best hand-cut costume and Reina Madre), “the other candidates had been jealous of what the Queen was not able to shine at the stage,” he said.
And this was noticed at their first idea in the bath suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and at their two elevators at the coronation celebration.
Although she was safe with both of them, she lacked the strength and the swing that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program Como en casa at the channel RCN, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss shows that the candidate who won most prizes during the competition will eventually not be Queen.
In addition, Valle went out of the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already be his reason that two days before the creation of the international jury, Lucy Doughty, they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
“Beautifulness is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the body and focus on social feeling, on having already worked with them before participating in competition in projects,” she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the derriers and the fibrosis that was noted in the stomach area, but this is contrary, for the jury chose her as a candidate for ‘natural beauty’ with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The queens' coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn’t have the best body that there was better, “but her problem with the fibrosis at the belly, which was not to be noticed for me honestly, pushed her score on the last day.”
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the failure of the woman from Valle del Cauca had been the surgical procedures she had undergone.
“The operations are okay, but Valle didn’t know how to make it right.
Your body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay her.
Because of this award, which will be awarded the first time by the National Beauty Competition, after the appearance in the bath suit, a terrible prediction was made that night. It was confused that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort award not to let them get into the crown's pleasure.
Whether this is true or not, Melina is now in her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that allows her to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions at the appointment of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will go into history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, has escaped the crown.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali entered history as the man who identified Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November, a lophoscopist of the State Attorney's Unit (CTI) from Cali as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Forces Colombia) went on to say: \"Alfonso Cano - by comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the department of the CTI, this week Eliazar González had a willingness to work with a man from Puerto Tejada who has been in criminal investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in congregations of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he settled after Valle over and after completing the required courses, specializing in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin exposed to frictions, i.e. of the hand and foot surfaces.
In the week of the use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something great was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspicion existed that one of the men who led the oldest guerrillas in the world could be, so he should take the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached with the investigator the place where the body was located, he could not identify it because of his physical appearance, for this was not the least similar to the figures he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer of the area, wore no glasses and was very thin.
Fingerprints are not lying.
Armed with a lupe, ink, a plant cell and a pocket lamp, Eliazar compares the fingerprints of the body to those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was 'Alfonso Cano'
The same night, this Puerto Tejada-based man was responsible for telling Defence Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that it was actually the chief of the FARC.
In Search of Tracks
For a dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the appreciation that President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González assigned at a press conference on the use of \"Cano\" was very important.
Many people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
In their arrest, many offenders file false testimony papers or they don’t have one.
We take off the fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to pull a piece of wall out of a house at a theft, because the thief had built himself up with his hand at this point when he pulled out a security full of jewelry and money.
“Walkings are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate for the removal of fingerprints, but in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the criminal involved in several thefts,” he recalled.
The fingerprints can also be relieved or charged with murder suspects.
A dead man was recently found surrounded by snuff bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be actuated, and in fact, a fingerprint agreed on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the killer, it is associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that “the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object”
When they appear, a plant cell or a band is used to take them.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the person's office.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification papers,” the expert said.
He said not everything was the same as it would be shown in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything is gold that shines, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
However, it can still be used if a corresponding comparison is carried out.
The “emperors” call out to the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters pushed together in tents on the Zuccotti Square.
A large part came to the space command and changed its location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement on Tuesday challenged the New York authorities when they again tried to enter the Manhattan Square with a judicial arrangement after being handed over from the square in the morning and tried to occupy another place at Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed themselves to the Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to join a judicial arrangement that allowed the \"emperort\" to re-tent at this site. While there was another part of the movement at the space command and occupied a park further north in the city, where there were nine arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we find ourselves together in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-in and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the movement ‘Ocupy Wall Street’.
Bray revealed that the response of the “empires” to the spaciousness of their tent camp, which had been arranged directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came before the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an arrangement prohibiting the violent space of the square and approved the tent by demonstrators.
In addition, the ‘empires’ occupied a new park, which is located at the intersection of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the site for at least an hour, but after that the police met and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray cannot give exact numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists with handshake.
The organization assures that hundreds of people have found themselves in this place, where an arrangement of religious leaders had also been found to be a sign of their support for the members of the movement and to be assigned to the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a private property site) remains closed in expectation of a judicial hearing that is still scheduled for this Tuesday, and in which the legality of the room taken in the morning grey is to be analyzed.
Some of the protesters driven from the square carried photocopys of this judicial arrangement and distributed them, even giving them some police officers who were guarding the place, resulting in “some minor clashes,” as Bray reported, some police officers had beaten demonstrators.
The judicial instruction prohibits authorities from removing members of Occupy Wall Street from the square and from applying \"laws adopted after the occupation and prohibiting the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other items they had previously used.\"
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that due to this judicial arrangement, the opening of the public transport and demonstrators had been lifted, and the protesters pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-enter into this place with tents and sleeping bags.
The mayor personally defended the rumour of the Zuccotti Square in the morning, where almost 200 people were arrested, and the decision was made because the protesters \"defeated the right\"
Bloomberg explained that he would have given the order to space the place because he had \"turned into a place where people didn't come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to damage others - because \"some business would have received threats - and the residents feared - their quality of life -
“The room in the morning gray was elusive and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests and not in protecting the interests of North American workers,” added the spokesman of the movement who accused the mayor of not respecting the freedom of the press.
The responsible members of Occupy Wall Street informed them that they were thinking about organizing “great actions” for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been taking place since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary at the TV Christmas Show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on December 1 in the TV program \"It's a Russell Peters Christmas\".
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allgemeine Assistant in Home Improvement - Rescue Swimmer in Baywatch - Sharjah at Playboy - the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Canadian television Christmas show.
The private television channel CTV today announced that Anderson, along with the \"croner\" Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on December 1 in the TV program \"It's a Russell Peters Christmas\" and will feature a very special Virgin Mary Life.
Today, CTV is spreading images of the television program in which Anderson - who also appears for the spread on the Internet of a self-rotated porno in which she, along with her former husband, the drummer of \"Mötley Crüe - Tommy Lee\", appears as a virgin Mary with a doll in the shot that Jesus is supposed to represent.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently worked as a Moderator at the broadcast “My Violent Torpedo of Truth” by Charlie Sheen as a child of Jesus.
CTV’s Christmas program not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from this controversy.
At one of his concerts in New York, Bublé recently called North America's Kim Kardashian as \"Hure\".
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spirals of the free fall from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still in the recovery after the destructive earthquake that occurred in a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster Japan has experienced since World War II.
The government’s first estimates in Tokyo judged the damage to $300,000, a blow that seems to weaken in spite of the difficult world economic situation.
After three-quarters of cases, information on the gross domestic product from July to September was used to conclude this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the rate high that year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The resurgence can be partly explained by machine sales for the reconstruction of areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decline by 0.9% for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increase.
Nevertheless, the actual shift in the Japanese economy is not based solely on keynsian attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan is especially alerted by the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, fueled by the growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - has fled into one of the \"refuge currencies - the investors who fled before the Eurozone's debt crisis and the tribulation forecast for U.S.A., a privilege that is like a gravestone on the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, the products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, returned their weak business results from July to September to the Yen notation.
While the markets continue to cover the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshiiko Noda continues to grow.
“One must pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of flooding in Thailand, and the rapid evaluation of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, yesterday.
The perspectives are really not very upsetting.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States in September had more clear signs of slowing economic development.
The indicator, which predicts the turning point of the world economy, revealed that the brake would be pulled in the largest economic potential.
Because he sank by four tenths up to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average value, which is 100 after it has fallen by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens has raised doubts again
Papadimos says the savings measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign written agreements
With the high risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also losing its own way into the labyrinth, which results from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the Consension of the new Greek Transitional Government is a response to the pressure from Brussels rather than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly confirmed by facts.
During the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there are no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed on by his appointment may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new savings measures and, in no case, withdraw his demand for new elections on the date specified 19 February.
“The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions made at the October 26 summit,” Papadimos assured us yesterday to open a parliamentary debate that will reach its climax tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programs to promote employment, reform of disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax intervention are the first initiatives.
In spite of this, Samara’s communication does not leave the doubt about his attitude: “We have committed ourselves to support the transition government, but otherwise to nothing.”
The Conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that needs to unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needed, and he made clear that he would not approve a declaration of commitment on the performance of the savings measures.
However, the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, refused to retaliate yesterday: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and leaders of the main Greek parties signed a clear written agreement not as soon as possible.
The Minister of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika “come back to Athens very soon, to discuss with the new government, which was necessary for the payment of the sixth section, in the amount of EUR 8,000 million, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knot has for a while.
Queen Sofía: “These are instruments for progress and hope.
The Queen emphasized Spain’s predominant position on this type of financing
Spain “has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of the smallest funding”
The Queen Sofía of Spain reminded us yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has developed into the second donor for this means of international cooperation.
The Queen inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Small Credits in Valladolid yesterday, convinced that there was “no doubt” that this kind of business would be “absolutely essential” to achieve the millennial goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and “especially the goal of living with incomes of less than one dollar a day, that is, below the poverty line”
Spain continues to work - on the expansion of the beneficiary network - to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task responsiblely - the Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will be made from the summit that lasts until Thursday - will ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women - are the main beneficiaries of these loans.
“We have recorded many successes, and are facing many challenges.
The summit on small-scale loans is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for the launch of \"two basic objectives\".
The Queen declared that it is expected that until the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households will cross the poverty line.
The concept of small loans goes back to Spain and the rest of the world on the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus years ago, which the Queen Sofia regards as an act of justice and recognition.
The father of this financing instrument described her as a “worshipful idealist who has dedicated himself to fighting poverty” and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first world summit in Washington and other meetings on the Côte d’Ivoire in 1999 and Canada in 2006. “We have been able to observe continuous development,” said the Queen, whose commitment to this project brought her the assessment yesterday as “family head” in Valladolid and as “a spokesman for the poor.”
Finally, the Queen Sofia ended her presentation by animating the present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
\" The Law of Ethics \"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is “an ethical commandment” for the entire democratic state.
In this sense it emphasized that it was a mistake to bind development aid to times of economic booms, because it was a \"permanent commitment\"
Jiménez felt that the small loans were a “serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty” and that the governments of the industrial states must now, more than ever, work in accordance with solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall to the ground.
For Spain, small loans are one of the “most important forms of development aid”
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, lamented the success — marginalized — people who are always standing before closed doors — to give hope — and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the guests into a city that opened “her gates, set by the spirit of solidarity.”
The CDU proposes to elect EU Presidents on the basis of general voting
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it was in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the activists who consider the policy of government with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The presidential aid of the European Commission proposed by the Bureau was almost unanimously adopted.
Among 1001 delegates, only nine had voted, ten had the vote.
The several minutes of standing ovation, which was first held by Angela Merkel due to her intervention events and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, had no doubt on the part of the three European-led finance ministers.
The chancellor’s main idea, as well as the requests, bears the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is “not less, but more, Europe.”
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because “nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro”
For the chancellor, “the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe”
This could be expressed by an amendment of the Lisbon Treaty to the budget policy of the countries in the eurozone, as could be expressed in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general voting — in order to give Europe a face-to-face view.
However, this is certainly one of the proposals adopted by Congress, which clearly stood Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Certainly, it is little likely that the 47 are quick to agree on this revolution: Groβ-British is against the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, in a overwhelming majority, the delegates rejected the proposal of the weighting of each country in the ECB’s board in accordance with the weighting of individual economies, which obviously resulted in a startling of Germany’s position.
The chancellor, considering the calming of the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her Congress at the expense of the “small” or the European countries in difficulty that would immediately criticise the arrogant Germany.
As far as Europe’s request for the significance of “German-French friendship” is dedicated to a paragraph, Angela Merkel France does not call on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in the case of illness messages?
After the family applications, UMP and the government now take on the sick news.
Nicolas Sarkozy will meet in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November, to seek a family aid fund and present a speech on the subject of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state.
In order to accompany this attack, which is due to the attempt to subjugate the economy in a harsh test, on the other hand, there is no less offer of an axis of the right presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee health messages.
At first, with financial objectives: the government is looking forward to the introduction of a fourth day of the year, before taking into account a sick report to workers in the private sector.
In German, this means that a sick worker would lose the salary of four days without the consent of the specific company, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A Maβ take, which, according to the daily newspaper Les Echos, threatens to complain anger, but would help bring in 280 million euros.
And the one with a different mammoth was more symbolic in nature: the state officials were planning an unrefunded Carence Day in the case of illness (so far there is no carence period for them, as opposed to the three Carence Days in the private sector).
While these issues are in the discussion, the majority also, by new means, exposes the subject of fraud, with this time aimed at the abuse associated with unemployment.
“Controls will be much more important, and they will be refunded if required,” Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13 in front of the transmitter’s microphone.
As in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of the sick reports seem to be somewhat disproportionate.
In fact, it has been the subject of permanent observations and political offensives that have produced the most frequent fruits since 2002.
The French are no longer more ill than people elsewhere in Europe.
First, however, we are living in the country-wide numbers.
According to CNAM, more than 237 million euros of daily expenses were paid in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health, day-to-day payments in 2008 amounted to 11.3 billion euros 5% of health expenditure.
This amount included 46% on motherhood vacations and work accidents and 54% on health holidays, which was €6.2 billion.
And that’s 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, on average, only 14.5 sick days were reported to the French compared to 17.8 days in 2009 according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
A mean value that confused certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40 000 surveyed asked French workers not to have taken any medical days.
Another study, recorded this time by health insurance, clearly shows that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
So, compared with their European neighbours, the French workers are no longer inclined to work in the workplace.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Center for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global rate of decline (sickness or otherwise based) oscillated, in France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the case of sick reports represents a disappearing low proportion in relation to black labor.
With regard to fraud, only a weak exaggeration is achieved here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 brings with it the fact that there are systmatic controls in cases of illness that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM (public university of education and training of technicians and engineers) found that 13% of 285,000 of the real-life, short-term medical reports that were “unwarranted or too long” in 37,050 cases.
In the systematic controlled cases of more than 45 days of duration, under 1.2 million 11% were “unsuited or unjustified” cases, which amounted to 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 “unlawful” cases for several million workers who have submitted a sick report.
A digit which represents only a weak excrement compared, for example, to that of the blackwork.
According to UMP, Dominique Tian, author of a case report published in July on this issue, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profit per year, i.e. more than the total costs of day-to-day compensation, and thus significantly more than the defraudation at last mentioned.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to get rid of its economy.
This was on Monday, November 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced before Parliament, adding the fact that his government was not sufficient for a hundred days to accomplish this task on the basis of the Union.
“In order to be able to continue the efforts to boost the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme,” said the chief of government in his first public speech on the opening of the debate on Parliament’s vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions made on 27 October on the occasion of the Euro Summit meeting is the \"head task - the new government, as the country's participation within the eurozone - is at stake as it added.
Similarly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country’s state deficit — by 9% — of the gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rights reject the new Spermaβ
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, gave his consent on Monday to the already approved maβs regarding an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not be willing to accept an additional spammage.
“We will not vote in favour of new maβams,” he said on the occasion of a parliamentary meeting of his party New Democracy.
He had prepared himself with the requirements for reducing budget deficits and debt, as well as for fighting waste, but each policy was hostile, which would hinder economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, with economic and monetary tasks entrusted to EU Commissioners who prevented IMF and EU from releasing the necessary loans over €8 billion without a written guarantee to all parties on their support of the planned measures, had answered Antonio Samaras that his word was enough and he would not sign anything under pressure from aucontrols.
Euthanasia and accompanying frivolity must be legalized, according to an expert body
Canadians live in refusal to die, as a report from the Royal Society of Canada
The body stated that governments, health care institutions, and doctors worked together on painful treatment to provide the best pain relievers, and that this also goes beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal to face death.
Only 9% of Canadians are actually willing to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and meet dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, who are linked to each other in various fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government modify the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanying slavery and euthanasia, where this choice is made, in patients who are considered capable of making such a decision.
As a wake-up, the experts cited a recently published survey of independent EIU society, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself on the 10th grade, the study notes that “the medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid of cutting the subject of death.”
For medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to pain-killing means, the experts ordered by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And despite the Canadian majority's desire to die at home, at last 68.6% of those die in hospital.
From all over the country, the rate of 86% of deaths in the hospital in Quebec is the highest.
In the question of euthanasia and accompanying slavery, the authors of the report come to conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already controlled, do not wish to make any changes to the Criminal Act on euthanasia and accompanying slavery.
But now, according to the experts who have inspected or decriminalized all those countries whose approach has legalized euthanasia and accompanied self-examination, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would involve abuse in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of incompetent or unwilling persons.
On the other hand, there are significantly more cases of such offences just in the countries where euthanasia and accompanying slavery are not legalized, as confirmed yesterday by Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, in a teleconference.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
“Also accompanied slavery is practiced in Canada, although here it is clearly illegal,” Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians advocate euthanasia
We agree that according to a 2010 Angus-Reid survey, 85% of Canadians had already been curtailed in favor of euthanasia, as they believe that it would be appropriate for individuals at the end of their lives to soften their suffering.
And 66% believe that the matter of legalization of euthanasia does not result in the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
In the case of those who have already practiced an accompanying slavery, the respondents at 41% believe that they should not be prosecuted criminally.
As regards maintenance or adjustment of the means in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the author of the report.
Similarly, in their recommendation list, they state that the criminal law states that the removal of the means for which a legal objection is available is not considered criminal.
The expert body also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting a removal of the means at the end of life, and to fear this without criminal prosecution.
The body stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together in the field of pain-reducing treatment to provide the best pain-relieving means, and that this also goes beyond cancer cases.
Finally, the body calls for pain relief or life-sustaining mammoths already used in the Canadian health care institutions, at least to consider these, since they served as little as euthanasia to reduce physical pain and to rely on the same methods.
Preservation of other experts
Some experts in the field of health care have already made reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has called the attitude of the report-signing experts, among other things, “extremely” because they do not set any limits to euthanasia practice in the end-phase disease.
“This opens the gates to a situation in which anyone who is life-sustaining and older than 18 years of age asks another person to help him with his suicide,” said RA Deschamps, who passed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seem to place the individual’s own responsibility over all the other values involved in the social action of society.
Now, he says, there are “control lines and obligations in a society”
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed \"a strong resistance\" to the conclusions of the report, which she has adopted as a pro-euthanasia manifesto.
Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the reports regarding the non-presentity of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying slavery are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls for President Assad to resign from power
Damascus plans a “complott”
Syria is now more isolated
The Partisan Baschar al-Assads demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Auβen Ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria’s Baschar al-Assads, which, however, with the support of Russia and a “complott” directed against the country, was strengthened yesterday.
Two days before the exclusion of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union had made its sanctions against Damascus worse, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighboring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the official Arab Prime Minister who had asked President Baschar al-Assad to lay down his office in Syria, in which about forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
\"Laughs Baschar the interest of his country at heart, he would resign, but in addition, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life - according to the king of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat chief Ahmet Davutoglu, on the one hand, had complained that since the beginning of the year, the attacks on the Syrian regime had not been successful.
“Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot please them must go,” he explained in a statement on Syria, the neighboring country, to which Turkey is taking a increasingly rougher stance.
On the one hand, the United States has welcomed the “enhancement of consensus against Assad and the makings of the Syrian regime” as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
International Community, United States, EU, Arab League and countries like Turkey have hit an ever sharper tone in the face of repression in Syria, as Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department, observed.
During this period, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria have died, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH.
Two other civilians, according to this NGO, were killed in the laid-back city of Homs in the \"Schuss and heavy bombings around Jobar\".
On the occasion of a press conference, Syrian Minister of Commerce Walid al-Muallim still felt that the country was “taxing towards the end of the crisis.”
On the other hand, he has responded with emphasis to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which, according to a “dangerous step.”
Syria's 'not to be abandoned' added under the torture that \"those who would fail to fight against Syria would fail'
Following the Syrian suspension decision, the Arab League is now investigating a “protective mechanism for civilians” and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
Alain Juppé also spoke out in favour of the release of UN observers to protect civilians from the regime’s repression that he was now encapsulated in his paranoia.
An audit plan of the League’s new meeting is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan decided on 2 November on the rise of the crisis, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Minister Sergei Lawrow described the Arab League’s decision as “uncorrected” yesterday to protect himself against possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian government chief, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that calls for “sacrifice” to regain the credit worth lost during the last months of the government’s Berlusconi.
The former EU Commissioner held negotiations with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to call a cabinet into Parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
“Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims,” said Francesco Nucara, MP of one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the President-in-Office.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had await his side, which Mario Monti gave Parliament a vote of confidence until Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The appointments will be made in the presentation presented by M. Monti of a strike list which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that the continued nervousness of the stock exchange and bond markets demanded their time.
In \"a democracy there are certain periods - to prepare a government as well as a government programme, he stressed that it is \"certain that the markets will show themselves to be sustainable and understanding\"
His order by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had increased again, especially after an unexpected industrial production decline in the Eurozone in September.
The acting prime minister shall establish a staff consisting of mainly technocrats, although he has emphasized that he would also like to include “politicians”.
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the evidence of Parliament’s confidence until Friday.
M. Monti has been committed to working in all urgency in the sense of the goal, making Italy the “new protagonist” in Europe.
A spokesperson for the EU Commissioner Olli Rehn emphasized that “we do not change our diagnosis of the Italian economy itself taking into account the new government.”
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its target of budget compensation in 2013, despite the savings plans launched in these last few months, has in particular requested new tough theme controls.
Emma Marcegaglia - Chief of Chiefs - Italy, who will meet on Monday on Monti, also exists on the need for economic incentives - that a country that has no growth that cannot respect deficitary figures -
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an “Epoche change - Italy after 17 years of ‘Berlusconism’ - the ‘Professor’ symbolises the challenge of trustworthiness, as well as a ‘other Italy’, according to the leading article authors.
The great unknown here is the permanence of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent preferred elections, as Italy has now raised EUR 200 billion in state bonds from April 2012.
Russian scientists help the Iranian nuclear energy program
A Russian scientist, Wjatsheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran develop a explosive capsule that could be used with a nuclear weapon, confirmed on Monday a nuclear crisis-specialized U.S. environment.
The ISIS Institute of Science and International Security is based on the recently published report of the International Atomic Safety Agency AIEA and other documents dating from this UN Agency for the investigation of this scientist.
The AIEA announced its “serious concern last week, on the occasion of a possible military dimension, of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to an extensive study of AIEA documents by ISIS, the 1934-born Danilenko had apparently worked in a Soviet military terminal center in Tscheljabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the explosion-produced production of synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he was to leave the center to establish a company in Kiev that produces \"Nano-Diamants\".
His company’s economic difficulties had led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he joined an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the AIEA stated strong evidence that Iran’s development — a nuclear explosive system — was supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only most accustomed to this technology but also, as a member of the Agency, the entire professional career has been working directly on the military nuclear energy programme of its country of origin.
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
The crimes and offences committed against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racist or religiously motivated acts of violence have either either declined slightly or decreased slightly in the same period, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is 49%, whereas a 13% increase in violent crimes against Catholics, a 4% decline in Jewish crime and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of \"hate-motivated crimes\" has increased to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% motivated by religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After a weakening in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes resurgence,” said the Human Rights First Human Rights Organization, “the increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant,” added the organization in a communiqué.
“Human Rights First had long emphasized that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious lawsuit against human rights,” added Paul Legendre, an organization’s representative.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to fight these attacks, adding that this could be done by improving the police attitude towards the ‘hate crimes’.
The “hatred crime” is an inheritance in American federal law from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish acts of violence directed against race, color, religion or descent and now includes crimes of sexual relations.
Twitter transforms the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
On Monday, the Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to allow its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which allows the service to be more similar to that of Facebook.
The new “Activity” and another “Name” tab allow better reading live reflection of the activities of other “Twitters” — the Internet user whose news “Tweet” is being tracked and who follow your messages.
This allows them to find out if they allow them to track their messages, whether they request new contributions, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu was tested before its general internet spread on Monday — in August with a small percentage of users — the Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner told the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, fitted with something esotherically encouraging wordlaut (RT to refer to another person's contribution). followfriday pour recommender de suivre un autre utilizer) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a and public plus large avec un maniament plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of certain “tweets” via the Internet.
“This is useless, intrusive, and like too much Facebook” writes @jemb123.
“The function “activity” will help me to better track certain elements of my Flux Twitterr,” @dannykronstrom explained.
Austria
Registration of a \"Golden Budget Rule\" in the Constitution
The government of the major Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to include a Golden Budget rule to reduce public deficits and also to avoid possible degradation on the part of the rating agencies in Austria’s top bond (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision from the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian state debt is 74.6%, that is, far beyond the 60% criterion set out by the Maastricht Treaty, but far below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If the ability to pay Austria did not fall to AAA on AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros of interest each year,” argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Minister of Justice.
Austria also offers a demand for the Brussels summit meeting of the Member States of the Eurozone on 26 October: the heads of state and government at that time would have requested the inclusion of public deficits by the end of 2012 as well as a return to the public account balance in the constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
The Maβfämung for this purpose by the Austrian government resembles the German model, since Germany had been the first European country to have incorporated such a rule into the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% each year of gross domestic product (GDP), but from 2017 the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% threshold of GDP, whereas the regional states should have balanced households as well as the municipalities.
The objective is to reduce the budget debt in the horizon of 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set out by the Maastricht Agreement.
Starker Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention in the currency markets
On Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshisiko Noda warned that Japanese official violence would reintervene in the currency markets if the yen continued to rise.
“If we should set up an exclusive availability in the exchange rate of the yen, we will intervene as we did the last time,” M. Noda said in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was relegated to the historic levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against dollars to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is in charge of a new record value since 1945 compared to the dollar.
However, the Yen has risen regularly over it, dominated by purchases of investors who view the Yen as “refuge” in these uncertain times of world economic decline and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell on Tuesday below 77 yen, the euro has been slumped below the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that the last intervention had triggered.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar noted 120 yen, the Euro more than 160 yen.
This dramatic fire of the Japanese foreign exchange harms the exports of the Archipelago, as it costs the “Made in Japan” products and reduces the income value drawn from Japanese companies abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
“Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast),” emphasizes M. Noda, who fears that this humiliation of the Yen may already kill the weak upsurge in the germ.
With the growth of the third quarter, the third economic world power has regained a resurgence with the growth of -1.5% in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter for the first time this year due to the rapid increase in exports and the consumption of the budgets which were bombed by the disaster.
However, the prime minister estimates that the cost of Yen does not reflect Japan’s economic foundations.
The Minister of Finance Jun Azumi, in turn, has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), who, on Tuesday, has opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee, to take all possible measures to disarm the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Institute, has, however, informed that BoJ has already introduced “suitable maβams”, thus exposing it to the fact that there is no additional currency lockdown to be expected on Wednesday.
On the last meeting at the end of October, the Notenbank had increased its national bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to raise the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of coverage, which it had dedicated for various purchases of financial titles to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rate rapids in the height, stock exchanges make withdrawers
The risk of the debt crisis remains untermined on European figures.
Despite the new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to rise steadily.
The stock exchange, which is still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, also drifted a little more into negative filth this Tuesday, November 15th.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10:00 and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt went back by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
“On the basis of the new tensions regarding the returns of the state bonds in the eurozone in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to spend some of their recent profits.
“The capital investors are nervous and aware of the risk of infection,” says Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters press agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which, on the other hand, suffers from the resurgence of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe, has continued to continue the debt crisis, having closed with a baisse of 0.7%.
“Japan, as well as the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving towards limited variation corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized — estimated Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern over the future of the Eurozone harms the single currency, which continues its baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
By 10 p.m., the European currency was worth 1,3570 dollers, so it was estimated by 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange brokers, the CDU, party of chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered in Congress on Monday, submitted an application that, in particular, provides the opportunity for countries in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% limit.
The interest rates of Italy and Spain are still at a very alarming level.
This Tuesday morning, the return of the Italian bonds reached 6.85% on 10 years, the one of the Spanish titles was up to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the South countries, as well as in France, continue to fuel the fears of investors.
The future Italian government chief Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy threatened by paralyzing due to the burden of debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed on his part that the implementation of the decisions made on 27 October by the Eurozone summit was “the main task” of his government.
Spain is located in the Visir of the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The more interest rate spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new historical high.
Expectation of growth figures of the eurozone
Statistically, France reported an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter by household consumption, resulting in a little better than expected 0.3%.
However, the statistical Federal Office of INSEE had revised the bosses of the second quarter's figures, with a minimum of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that concerns the economic experts most.
Germany had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first increase in the total eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or due to emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and costs of electricity affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies in direct maβe.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting to consider this subject and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it sins the overall economic, social and ecological consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, proprietary data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, demographic evolution is pushing forward to double the electricity demand by 2050, there is no need for an enormous proportion of the world’s population to give up a vital element.
At the same time, we need to slow down the link between fossil resources to continue producing electricity without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate instability.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to remain isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which undermines its decision to find a replacement resource, nor in Switzerland, which has just intended to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Groβ Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil to name only a few states, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, on its part, decided to join their park into another unit by re-operating the Three Mile Island plant, which was closed after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model, which is aimed at renewable energy sources, is sometimes set as a model, the reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of an endowment of the electricity price, an energetic dependence reinforced by the increased reduction in the reduction of the energy consumption on import gas, in particular on Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will become noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives an occasion for reflection.
On the one hand, Denmark is a European table leader with regard to wind energy, from which it relates 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; on the other hand, its CO2 emissions as well as its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill compared to our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy represents a key role in competitiveness and a stability of the industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in the price of energy, which is what the noble statements about the re-industrization of our country and the defense of the purchasing power will sound to the illusion.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are willing to pay as little as they can to recognize resistance to the principle of this energy source.
We agree that our country’s energy policy has allowed us to build an industry branch with 125,000 direct and 410,000 in-depth jobs.
Due to its strong export characteristics, it brings a handful of specialized small and medium-sized companies to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France were to take the decision to step out of the nuclear power, it would fall to that part of the SMEs, and the annual EUR 6 billion in investment goods and nuclear energy exports would become more and more collapsed.
Which electrician would appoint an EPR designed to function on sixty years if the decline of its producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, it is necessary to arrange that there is as little one as a devil’s work a miracle to produce electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva to use nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
To maintain the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works such as construction in Flamanville.
Their working teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are just to be possessed by the security representation.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry experienced three serious accidents.
Only one single, in Three Mile Island, has entered under normal operating conditions, so he left without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Czechoslovakia, the drama was challenged by reactor construction as well as inexcusable human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters was never caused by daily mass outage, which caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its teachings from this accident as it did after the two previous ones.
As a fruit of this procedure as well as a cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a design that enables it to withstand such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among electric engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by listening to them free train to travel the leadership position in the incomparable nuclear power development.
It is inconvenient and legitimate to look for the best energy boutique for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party leaders dominate a debate that defines our country’s economic, social and financial situation.
Is Immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy, led by Nicolas Sarkozy, has been criticized from many angles - overburdening police, court and administrative bodies on the basis of a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a 'land of human rights', as France itself has called.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students from the official side had marked the weekly shows, which the Minister of the Interior had by now (see Libération of 23 May) announced that France \"does not need any talents, Maurer or Kellner from abroad\"
But this policy has rarely been analyzed from the economic point of view.
This issue is a broad consensus between rights and links.
From the right hand side, Jacques Chirac’s tone, which had declared in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrants, may not be a problem for a country, from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had given up in 1990, France “can’t take up the whole world’s poverty.”
The only difference is in the degree of growth
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by Horden Polish Klempner was shared both from the right and from the left in 2005.
From both camps the immigrants were perceived as burdens for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the degree of growth which is wanted to be faced with immigrants.
Francois Hollande is limited in his programme to banalitys, which point out that partnership development allows us to solve our “migration problems”.
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the choices; however, it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron provide us with the latest information on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists regarding the positive impact of the immigrant flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigrant countries.
Immigrants would deplete growth and damage the labour market situation.
Fears over the influence of migrants are based on the notion that these threaten to substitute the local workers, in particular the less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
The experience, however, shows that the immigrants are, in truth, much more complementary than the local wage workers, as they perform heavy-pointed occupations in sectors that are technically unworked.
The small-scale immigrants work in sectors that do little to attract local wage workers, which are more qualified among immigrants working in dynamic sectors where training is not compatible with the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesists, so this complementarity between locals and migrants also causes a positive effect of immigrant access to wages and domestic labour market conditions.
Giovanni Peri calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the immigrant flood resulted in a co-compliant long-term increase in real-time zones between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas spending and economic growth introduced by immigrants (high proportion of immigrants among U.S. Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, in which European countries average about 1% of the overall budget.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30, on average, spends a net contribution (income minus expenses) of around €150,000 on average over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring in the missing intersections (with the teeth) on his arrival of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which the immigrants were supposed to fear, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; it is also a sensitive good.
The European continent itself should remember who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had passed through the tragedies of World War I, Totalitarianism, Holocaust, the Gulag, and Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some might have believed that it was sufficient to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, in order to reject democracy once and for all over their enemies.
Since Napoleon, the little one, it has been known that it was a characteristic of mindfulness.
The general right of election, which represents the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can be as good as the “suppression instrument,” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot then expressed.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of the forces, education, enlightenment, economic and social community spirit, a justification.
The crisis in Europe, where we are, is an economic crisis, but it is also a very, very and very much political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind of the Greek true-falsified referendum would have had a double decisive character in this regard: once the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing feeling of their inability, their unavailability.
This ambivalence should be regarded as overwhelming.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have deteriorated today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for a success of the domestic referendum, which was organized in accordance with the needs and in the wrong order.
A freelance for the European sole ruler or a leap with connected eyes into the void of the nationalist withdrawal: a gross choice for the citizen!
No, we want hackbeil, but a collective task, from a full right, clear and steady, an election and democracy, this time at a European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - there is no longer any way where the list ends - since there is only one crisis, and it prevails in Europe.
It is all of Europe, which is in favour of the dictatorship of markets and the rating agencies, which suffer from its powerlessness and its lack of solidarity.
It is all of Europe, which is humbled at an international level.
One is worried about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - it is all Europe, which is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every individual of the nations that are associated with it.
The urgency is to give the People's Sovereignty the leadership of the European project back to hand.
Because it is on the whole that Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and create a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level on the condition that cannot be enjoyed without total democratic jurisdiction, without leading us safely into destruction.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists has been fought over for a long time, everyone today is pushing the European economic leadership to do so.
Misunderstanding.
But this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it suggests to the citizens - would be a resurgence and a further bag of gases.
We need to take a new stage of European construction.
In order for the Republic to be created in France, it was necessary to \"create\" Republicans.
The revolution of the interests alone could not be enough here.
This education remains valid.
We need to form a better integrated Europe at an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European People's Sovereignty.
We need Europe to create Europe.
“Available” chip cards become general goods
The World Trade Fair for Chipcards opens its doors in Villepinte near Paris on Tuesday in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
In contrast to the 320 million sold a year before, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe wins in terms of the contactless payment of land after a long period of time behind the Asia Pacific region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
However, consumer markets make steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move at a higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
“Two large-scale French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out their customers’ bank cards, which are equipped with contactless chips in the future,” Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France, announced.
Banks test payment by mobile
However, this is only a first step on the way to the payment means of the future: the mobile phone.
A small percentage of devices disappearing is so far equipped with the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) necessary to carry out these transactions.
“They are in a hurry.”
“But at least next year, they should learn a real up-to-date development.
“We expect the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” explains Marc Bertin, chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees should be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also said yesterday to prepare the market introduction of an offer that allows their customers to make contactless payments by phone.
Terrorist Front understands from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The relations already under suspicion between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Auβen Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers has now gained “certainty”.
“The way in which both organisations deal with each other and the relations of the secret services indicate a clear cooperation,” he explained without further going into detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger took place last January has promoted interfaces on days.
The Antoine de Léocourt and Vincent Delory, which were captured at a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi, were to be killed on the following days, as several of their kidnappers were killed on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to find several phone chips in the debris at the place of use that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the phone calls led to several conversational partners stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France International (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: a number leads to a Nigerian who had stayed in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, the Wiege of Boko Haram for a long time; the other leads to a man who is close to the Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a progress, but you have to wait for more clear evidence to come before you can talk about an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem.
“It is unthinkable, however,
“It has been known for years that the sect refers to financial and intellectual support from Auβen and that it is increasingly active - the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo is mild.
In these last months, these “support services” have become increasingly obvious in their course, as well as the claims and operating modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the addition of suicide killers and the use of increasingly complex explosives that carry the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The International Community to begin at Washington has since put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have, in fact, long considered the grouping as a Community of Illuminates which should not be given special attention.
Fast success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, school and fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, the Boko Haram - which means as much in Haoussa as \"the western education is a shame\" - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this medium-free region, the merger experiences rapid successes.
It politicizes itself and demands strict compliance with the Sharia, while its associated activists engage in the fight against the godless central government.
First, the activists have churches, bars and authorities in the vision.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram showed themselves particularly active with their intensified attacks against the Commissioners.
However, Abuja’s reaction is as usual indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, numbering 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken captive, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its highlands in the north.
Last Christmas she became known for an assassination in Jos, which demanded 80 lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned the debt of a suicide attack that occurred at the secured police headquarters in Abuja, the first of its kind.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations was equipped for the final international target disc.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which will lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has since troubled all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied to operate the Somali of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé had warned of Boko Harem on a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria and had shown ready to communicate “all indications.”
The World According to Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are rivalling in simplification and ignorance regarding China, Iraq and aiding Israel.
Can a crisis-stricken America lead a complex world with simple to not say: a sensitive idea?
If you listen to Republican presidential candidates in this way, the voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their competitors have made their thunderous statements, as well as their statements on Aucontroln politics, traditional Republican focus, repeatedly publicized.
Over China, Iran, and Israel aid fall, often in no way under-walled slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the Grand Old Party, at the highest in the course, the Chinese threatened to quote before the WTO, and they considered the \"valuable manipulation\" leading issue in an American that was most resilient to Asia by the migration of all industrial branches to Asia.
I'm sorry if this is going to imply the introduction of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of Auβenpolitik, has almost snuffed out the air with regard to his emotive gestures.
He had called for a hand-resistant but constructive exchange of talks with Beijing (also Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman is not heard as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's Ebony
Romney had also vowed military battles against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear program were to fail.
“If I’m elected, I’m going to hold Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will get the bomb.”
He promised Israel stronger military aid and accused Obama of being guilty of this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second-highest-placed candidate, on his part carries a humiliating act of ignorance to the show.
He recently called on China to counter the Chinese military threat, as Beijing's \"try to develop nuclear power\" seemed to pay more attention to the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Texas governor, Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military battles against Iran, is on his part ready to serve the U.S. Army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama’s 2009 ban on torture attacks against mutmatagal terrorists was also backed by Cain, Perry and the candidacy Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an auβ political heavyweight.
The current presidential contestants opposed, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all of them, won the Cold War.
They recalled that Obama was also an amateur and had to give water in his wine, which was the subject of anti-terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive two-way conversation with Iran, the presumptive withdrawal of his “young” from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of weakness.
This opposition, however, is not so unrelenting.
The population is more likely to estimate the positive balance sheet of national security under Obama, who has shut down Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has protected itself from military interventions that lead to paralyzing.
And Obama is more surprised by his argument that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to restore its leadership to new life.
North Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the Baltic Sea’s seabed and connects western Europe directly with Russia, was put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to do this event with Glanz and Gloria.
Over 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the dedication of the new North Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly to each other under sea level last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea coast.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically turned the control of the valve, which transports the Russian gas to the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gases per year are to be delivered to Western Europe by a first pipeline of 1,224 km length, which connects the region of Saint Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of French total consumption - will be completed at the end of 2012.
And you already have the eventuality of building a third line on your own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and pointed completion of this huge building acts like a victory.
The project was strongly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any trace path through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the land route.
For this reason, these two countries lose a little of their power: it will now be more difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the most committed in the debate, was not reluctant to compare the Nord-Stream pipeline with a new German-Soviet package in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the Polish Occupation in 1939.
This means that the topic of political opinion is the most sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
This, however, at the expense of European energy, as the project has struck a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In less than five years, Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries that have strong gas consumption and its gas incidences.
\"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way - confirmed François Fillon at the inauguration of the gas pipeline by pointing out the extent to which the large-scale gas contracts are also important from the political and economic side.
All of this explains the broad smile of the gas supply management represented in Lubmin.
The construction of this gas line is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line consists of steel with concrete coating, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the sea floor, at about 200 m depth.
In its construction, mining fields had to be excavated from World War II.
“About a hundred mines had to be removed or destroyed,” said Jens Müller, spokesperson for the company Nord Stream.
Auβerdem had to be made reinforced maβs for the protection of fauna and flora.
The line is a long hose of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, which has nothing interrupted throughout the length: neither by valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was provided off the coast of Sweden, but the project responsible had been removed from it, as Sweden had little to do with seeing a Russian state society settled in a permanent way at the height of its coasts.
“In the case of a havarie, we close the gas through in less than a minute — precise Jens Müller.
In the case of a leak, the gas contained in the gas line escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the constructors to be only less likely, as the swivel needle was estimated to have a stability of a leak per 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas remote line is guaranteed by both an underwater robot which is controlled by a seaship for external observation purposes, as well as by a device that orbits inside the gas remote line.
It has the shape of a cigar, a meter diameter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and moves on through the gas pressure.
After three full days of continuous movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on possible deformations of the metal upon its arrival.
The gas power line was designed to work for fifty years without having to be subject to only the smallest repair.
Gas circulation is easily guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance bar, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have united their forces to achieve this project.
However, the guidance remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, German companies E. ON and BASF (depending on 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gas Union and the French company group GDF Suez (depending on 9%).
These five companies have formed a company that is called Nord Stream and which is tasked with the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favorable.
Gazprom has then rented the entire capacity of its gas transport, on an extended twenty-year contract.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how grossly transported the amount of gas is, — precise Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas supply line was secured to 30% of shareholders as well as 70% by bank loans.
The total working costs should be €7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the investment figure was 240 million, for example.
However, the minority shareholders are sure to retake their expenses, since Gazprom alone carries the liability risk.
The gas pipeline enters a sandy coastal strip of Lubmin forested with pines from the Baltic Sea today.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the gas outlet spores.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is passed on to the German gas remote lines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been delivered with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour as well as 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
From an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventures, hours spent with writing on candles.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognisable, with its black, rectangular inkband, its rubber band, the egg-shelled sides, as aged over time.
The Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, who is based in Milan, decided to market a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company’s specialist consultant, was assigned to introduce the new product to the market.
The notebook was inspired by an age-old production technique called Mole Skin (Moulwurfshaut), which is a cotton bag used for, for example, reference of pulsating benches.
This type of notebook was very much asked by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that until the 20th century was considered an icon of avant-garde artists,” explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand-responsor at Modo Modo.
Success enters.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% and set up a 12.7 million-piece paragraph.
This is far from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is executed in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It’s difficult to create a phantom image of the buyers as well as businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small, Italian company, which initially numbered 12 employees, now employs 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of city centers and is committed to continuing its identity.
“We followed the time-spirit and his new writing needs, which exist despite the e-mail’s up-to-date,” Maria Sebregondi said.
This cultural character is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called “Detour (Retour)” in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno, the company also brought a band with leopard patterns to the market.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural contemporary spirit and understood how to diversify his products: bags, appointment calendars, fillers, computer covers... The brand has the entire bandwidth of articles.
A success that brings envy to the plan: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, which today acquired Syntegra Capital, thus creating a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled employment workers staying at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today, the 15th week of work begins for disabled
In spite of a deliberate public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate in disabled persons is always twice as high as the average average: 19% against 9% of the total population.
Encouragement?
\"No, says Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Union Adapt, who sets up the 'week of work for cancellation'.
“The progress made within fifteen years is significant.
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not double, but three times as high.
“Non-destrotrotz remains a lot to do.”
It has to be said, however, that for disabled unemployed, there are still numerous obstacles before they get a job.
It is common for older people: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low qualification level: 80% of them do not have abductors and there are only 10,000 discounts among the 2.3 million students with higher education degrees.
In the end, long-term unemployment is also widespread: 53% of the deficits are compared to 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to get back to work, and which form the core of the problem, according to Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a 1992-based association that helps companies to acquire disabled employment.
So much to the proper brakes.
Stay the unspoken, the spiritual ones, who do indeed, but develop slowly.
A study conducted in April by the Association of IMS Entrepreneurs for the Journal of La Cité stated that the surveyed managers have - a weak level of knowledge regarding disabled persons - which is \"overrepresented - from persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually minors -
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a wide way ahead to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled employment workers, which was established in a 1987 law.
These last mentioned figures from 2008 refer to a quotient of 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” reports Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefifph, the organization that is assigned to enter contributions from companies that disregard this law.
The evidence: The number of payer companies has decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 (from 606 to 480 million euros) as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011.
“The 2005 law, which provides for increase in contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies, Pierre Blanc said.
“But this improvement also expresses a real insight especially in the large-scale corporate groups,” he said.
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the company's jobs between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled employment, companies with 100 to 199 employees, on the other hand, 82%.
Hazard: “What luck
Even before they offered the \"Blues Tuesday evenings (20:45 a.m.) the forehead, Eden Hazard and George's Leekens had not relished their pleasures that brought them the friendship game.
It would be too far-reaching to claim that there has been a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolically.
Side by side on the stage stage of the Stade de France sitting George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have been good and happy to close peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had eaten nothing but praise for his person.
“I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian.”
\"I want to look forward - assured the birthed Liller is on his side.
As for the contrast between his presentation in club and national self, “It’s a unity that justifies everything”
“In Lille, I am all year round, which is not the case in Belgium.
“It’s time for me to start.”
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought Friday night against Romania with regard to the match against France to finally “slight”
Without leaving the note of “pleasantness.”
The French national team fired since the age of 7, and he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
“I was always supported, so he confirmed.
This necessarily contributes to further strengthening the “unique” character of this encounter.
So much in advance: “Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there, he contends.
“We’ve just walked over the road.
“To be able to play means big luck.”
On his part, Lekens was accused with charity, Stolz.
“The pride of wearing out a gala match.
\"Stolz - also to confirm - in his property as a 'neighbor' - that France has again become a team at a very high level - and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc has done damn good work,” he said excitedly.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the plane with the Blues (the French National Self) ... and in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are coming out of big business, he stressed.
“We are planning a thing that players are ambitious, they are hungry.”
“You will notice this in the upcoming games - the game against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento faces the back game against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the game, both teams had failed in their business.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that “La Selecçao” will qualify for the 2012 European Championship for his national self, for which he has been responsible since September 2010.
In fact, for Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and an opponent to serve, namely, Bosnia.
In view of the play (0-0) on Friday in the Hell of Zenica it seems obvious that the worms have not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated clearly the match over more than an hour, but the team was unable to put up the matter with the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from her.
“That’s a good result, but it’s a certain risk because we didn’t reach an outdoor.
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to strike through in front of an audience who might be equally hot-tempered, even if the match was, of course, announced as “very scarce,” said the optimistic but clear-cut Bento.
“We expect a very tight match, but we are perfectly convinced that we can win the upper hand,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We continue to have a 50% chance at the 2012 European Championship, but relative to Carlos Queiroz’s successor.
On Friday in Bosnia, the Portuguese are forced to reach and win a goal.
An indistinction can already satisfy the Bosnians who also need a gate.
“That’s a good result, but it’s a certain risk because we didn’t reach an outdoor,” Bento regrets.
“We’re going to go against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese had already been putting maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to “give them no time to think”
A good idea, provided that it is implemented in fact this time.
