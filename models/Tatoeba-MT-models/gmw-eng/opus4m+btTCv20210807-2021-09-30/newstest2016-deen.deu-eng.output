Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes the ongoing settlement building of Israel and challenges Netanyahu’s lack of will in the peace process.
Through Obama’s campaign for the Iranian nuclear program, the relationship of the two continued to deteriorate.
In March, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech before the U.S. Congress at the invitation of the Republicans, which was in part valued as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not addressed to Obama, a meeting had rejected him with reference to the upcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor admits to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a slightly clumsy voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb it was important to emphasize that his “sex dog” was still alive and probably excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house, officials found Amy’s body and a handwritten note that was criticized on a white block: “I’m so sorry, I wish I could make it go away, I loved Amy and she’s the only woman who ever loved me — this was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who had taught in two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school area, where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university employees had heard shooting at 10:18 p.m.
He said that Lamb made the hanging emergency call sometime after.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police grabbed him.
A day after shooting at the university, which forced students and lecturers to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to give themselves a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him, said helped draw an image from a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to their lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentice died, said he has no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the “miraculous people” with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teachers include 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations toward problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, as if something was wrong with him.
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he had to deal with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a holiday for health reasons and said that he had some health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
The latest changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion, which had worked so hard for Lamb, would not guarantee him an automatic way to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “of course there was something in Mr Lamb’s idea.”
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing from campus, police later found Lambs Spur when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb himself killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still on the way.
It wasn’t immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and teaching.
He promoted education in spring.
One of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lam was 20 when she met with her friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
At the time, he was the women's swarm.
All the girls melt there when he was there - said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentices were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, “I killed my wife, but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning who lived with them in the brick house, bordering a Bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was okay.
The ex-husband of Prentices, Shawn O'Steen, said they had been taken 15 years ago, but friends had remained and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
“She was completely destroyed on the ground,” O’Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard Lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Auertiss when, three years ago, he and Abigail both appeared on a summer market.
Later, they played the one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter wrote and sang her own music.
Prentice was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a poorly lit bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Auertiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmony game before a sparing audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We were in the backyard and shrugged with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminary program and specialized in American natives and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and Student Committee.
On the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, around 900 people, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community, attended a candlelight memorial celebration on Tuesday evening.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnwache, while the University choir \"Bright Morning Star\" and \"Amazing Grace\" sang.
The lesson will be resumed on Wednesday.
“We are trying to move our students to return,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency call referred to Prentice as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to stop fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the currently employed employees and season workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it was planning to hire 40,000 people in stores and sales centers across the country. 45,000 more workers were hired during the 2014 Christmas season.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start application talks this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to set up time workers to equip stores with employees selling, sending and delivering products.
Michael J. Fox boasts about his “date” with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also notable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me,” he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary “Back in Time”.
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated gown and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
Back in Time - a documentary on “Back to the Future” presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
\"Back for the Future\" premiered 30 years ago.
“It’s really for me,” Spielberg said, “undisputedly the biggest time travel film ever filmed.”
Back in Time will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
General Secretary Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia’s reinforced military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution — the nearly five-year-old conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and to support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Minister of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the edge of the General Assembly’s Prime Minister’s meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regrets that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers \"make this situation irrevocable\"
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity when dealing with the crisis in Syria, which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 survey values that show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a Flop.
Others put him off as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn’t (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump lead in the two-digit field, and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of the nomination of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize Trump’s endurance and begin to let their dollars flow to boost him.
Here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey by Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans had seen the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are kept in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey by CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “satisfied” or “satisfied” if Trump nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “wrong” if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be \"satisfied\" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be \"unsatisfied\" or \"displeased\" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, was the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, ABC News/Washington Post said on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-election state of the nation, Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a senior commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think he does not have the personality to effectively perform his office, and almost six out of 10 independents say his temperament does not fit into the White House, says ABC/Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to the idea.
When they set up their scholars' hats, Republican voters consider Trump to be real.
If they are asked who won the GOP nomination the most, say after a survey by CNN/ORC last week four out of ten that Trump is the best bet.
This has been a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal sphere in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination against just 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
However, it has been shown that a variety of GOP voters view Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the split field probably contributes to Trump's leadership, while anti-trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diffusely.
But a poll from Monmouth University in early September shows that in a mortgage head-on-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps the majority support.
He scored 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, ahead of Marco Rubio 14 points, ahead of Walker 15 points, ahead of Jeb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a mortgage head-to-head race.
A scarce majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have firmly forgiven their votes.
Of course, much can happen to change this, and no one can really say never change the opinion.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition at the moment of the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico’s rapists two months ago in his election speech, immigration was a turning point in public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression will keep the Republican Party's crucial Hispanic Americans away and damage the re-orientation efforts.
But according to the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the crash light, Donald Trump will likely do it.
The frustration over the government is climbing to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now have around half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in ABC/Post’s new Monday survey, they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
They are also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent \"unsatisfied\" and 21 percent \"hole angry\"
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential facility - overlooking the North Sea Watt.
In the street, a square meter of a Reetdachhaus costs around 73,300 euros.
“On sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited,” the study says, so the high price.
A new study shows where special layers cost one square meter the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student budget in Munich are not really little.
Unlike Germany’s top residential areas, however, one of the prices is like Peanuts.
The Real Estate Service Provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in winding heights.
There are tens of thousands of euros - per square meter, well-known.
Well, who can afford it...
By the way, Munich is not at the top.
Champions League: Bayern-Traumstart thanks to Müller and Götze
Twice gate protection in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller simply has a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a earned 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign pick-up of the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given a dream start to the “Mission Milan” to FC Bayern in Piraeus’ Hexenkessel.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their pick-up game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52/90.+2) and Götze's hit (89.) earned at 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th starting success in series is to be the first step towards finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
Müller received a friendly support from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto at his 28th match in the Champions League for the Bayern leadership, which allowed one to pass as a flank thought shot by the world champion.
“We will not underestimate them,” said Bayern captain Philipp Lahm before the game at the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans, and the Münchner held word.
They showed a focused and committed idea, without glaring.
Piraeus had won his youngest six home games in the royal class, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
Borussia Dortmund (1:3).
But the Bavarians, unbeaten in seven European Cups with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They ran bravely, but in their offensive efforts, they often turned to works without cause.
The attacks were too often launched by game move on the left side of Douglas Costa, who rarely went through the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flank from the right half field in the upper left.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave the possible 2:0.
The best opportunity in half had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos stormer Ideye Brown hit Poland's headball off the line (26th).
Then by direct decrease, the Torwart Roberto paired with the knee (35th).
Although the Bavarians raised their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to set needle stings.
At Torhütter Manuel Neuer, however, he was left.
For example, when he directed a shot from Ideye over the latte (56).
Before Neuer, Guardiola had a four-chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did it well.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the frame, first sat outside.
The WM-Held gave green light only after the completion training, said sports executive Matthias Sammer at “Sky”: “Whoever wants to make something else out of it, that’s already malicious.”
During the first change, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the attacked Lewandowski (59).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by eleven meters, Müller put another one on it.
Before the game, it had come to Krawallen in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially mutilated Bayern fans in their audience block apparently provoked the followers of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and went on strike against the Munich supporters.
At least a Bayern fan was transported from the stadium.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth
Anyone who smokes, not only harms the lungs, but also the teeth - this suggests a Pentagon long-term study.
The good news: In case of neglect, the risk quickly drops.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees from the German Institute of Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
In comparison to non-smokers, smoking was at risk of losing their teeth prematurely to higher the 2.5 to 3.6 factor.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth decay are caries and inflammation of the gum, the DIfE emphasizes.
For this parodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss therefore goes back to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear how much smoking increases the risk of caries.
People who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time, the researchers wrote in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it may take more than ten years for the danger to fall back to the level of non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University Birmingham.
People had to be convinced of becoming non-smoking, said study director Heiner Boeing of DIfE: “Smoking shortens the life span”
Not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health up to high age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE said.
Previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure.
The new long-term study underwall the findings.
Archaeologists shoot at Cologne Rheinufer on the rest of the late Antique
For a number of times, archaeological findings have been made at the right-hand Rheinufer in Cologne.
Near the building site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historic buildings, Museum leader Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of construction on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called ground monuments.
In all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always used as a specialist for archaeological monument care.
In the third building section of the Rheinboulevard, archaeologists have now been found.
It has already been known from text documents that a church was established in the 4th century and in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 tombs was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman caught by freight train
After a young woman at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Linderen has crashed, the federal police ask the population for help.
On the early Wednesday morning at 1:40 p.m., the woman crossed from the direction of the railway station building coming to the end of the railway and was caught by a freight train that came from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, she suffered the most serious injuries of this train.
She was treated emergency medically on site and taken to a hospital by rescue forces.
There is no evidence on the basis of the young woman's nightly crossing of the track.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passengers from Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarher Straße (L364).
Notes given about the cause of the accident can be given below the clock and free federal police hotline under phone 0800/688000 or any other police service.
EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
The EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system in order to defuse the dispute on the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP.
The controversial private closures for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be resolved by a more transparent system, which in its way corresponds to much more traditional courts.
“We want to set up a system that citizens trust,” said the responsible EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström.
Sweden has proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position into free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced support.
TTIP will create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people.
Plans for reforming the current arbitration procedures specifically provide that the EU and the US together select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are to come from the same parts of the EU, the US and from third countries.
For the first time, there is also a second instance.
It would allow it to raise opposition to judgments.
To date, the members of the proceedings have agreed on arbitrators, and there has been no possibility of opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion of the past few months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, she wants to work on an International Investment Court according to her own information.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clarified.
The investor-state separation procedures (ISDSs) particularly required by large-group companies are considered one of the main reasons for Europe’s major resistance to TTIP.
The traditional arbitrations are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, over which companies are subject to damages from taxpayers, to impose national laws, or to enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organizations, such as Campact, referred to the proposals of the EU Commission as inadequate.
It was mainly criticised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
However, the German Secretary of Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as major progress.
The Commission took into account key points in the reform that Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel made in the spring with other EU Trade Ministers.
The old system of private arbitral courts is from the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European BusinessEurope corporate association warned against restricting the opportunities of the economy through too many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could be affected by this, it said.
When talks about the TTIP Free Trade Agreement (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, it remains unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been under way since mid-2013.
The issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year.
This date is considered to be non-resistible.
Delicate People of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sat on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
In addition to him is a flip chart on which the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, has almost been given by Stevens.
He tells about his fascinating and tenderly arranged songs on different sites, which he repeatedly signs on the map.
Where it originated and what it looks like, in its home.
Stevens has since proved to be a wonderful creative sinner.
With the 2003 release and third album Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State, cleverly composed songs appear to be very close to the American people of the late 1960s, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
The rumor, \"Michigan\" would be the first part of a moving series: each of the 50 U.S. states will be sung as a result.
However, as early as 2004 and in Rheinnacht, “Seven Swans” has already appeared and is breaking down positive expectations.
Reduced Stevens appears here.
Live enough for him to play guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
With \"Illinois - \"Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise - 2005 appears a surface-covered celebrated masterpiece.
Overboarding ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard Charts and lacks an annual best list of influential music media.
After highly productive experiments, Stevens then uses “The Age of Adz” (2010) very extensive electronic offsets.
This sixth-class studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
As long as the smaller clubs escape, the stage shows will be here for the colorful spectacle of neo-store tapes and large fluorescent stage deco.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring as part of a five-member band through Germany.
In the dark held Hamburger More!
The theatre presents the “Carrie & Lowell” available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now trapped in their chairs, the clearly matured Stevens returns to intimacy and to the people.
Without directing a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the wide-enriched album.
From the audience we hear that the talk is “opulent” and you can throw away the “plate in the ground” with it.
First, thanks to Stevens’ modesty, he plays acoustically few older songs and ultimately deplores himself with a great deal of applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's question hour
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut is expected with tension at the Prime Minister's question hour.
The new Labour chairman Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at the Prime Minister’s question hour and to start with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will raise himself to ask the first of his six prescribed questions shortly after lunch, with his performance likely being reviewed by the media and the Labour deputies nearby.
He requested “less theatre and more facts” at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip a few meetings to leave her colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, for after his appointment she will be appointed as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the Labour Chairman’s decision to hold a 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem, to provoke criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the center of several title-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesperson for Mr Corbyn said he had \"stand in respectable silence\" and he recognized the \"heldness of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England.\"
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem, \"independing on his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.\"
Almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, calling for differences in the economy, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party initially supported him as leader.
The BBC’s political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also within Labour’s stacks, according to Mr Corbyn’s statements on the position to the European Union and the limitation on profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is making changes to remove the whole idea of a restriction in total.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow-working and pension minister, said the party was \"very clear\" that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman to face David Cameron, since he is Tory chief, in the last decade across the Dispatch Box in Parliament.
The Labour Chairman, who promised another policy approach, says he has “crowd-sourced” ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the prime minister’s question hour is too confrontational, and that he will avoid both “sluggishness” and the dispute with reeling, and instead has taken action to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister, will represent him if he does not participate - for example, when Mr Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word, and that he spoke to John Bercow, the spokesperson for the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a Kasperle Theatre, which is often linked to the question-hour of the prime minister, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the question hour with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of a leader’s judgment and leadership in the lower house and his position among his colleagues, although critics argued that they had become a cartoon and needed far-reaching reforms.

pound increases through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
In parallel to this, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9% compared to the same year-on-year period.
This percentage has been the fastest and quickest assessment of the time of an interest rate since 2009.
The pound rose by more than 1% compared to the dollar to $1,5505 and was climbed up to 0.84% compared to the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229,21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20 % jump after the rival AB InBev's acquisition offer.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods.
Richemont’s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China — a key market for Burberry — are again increasing.
Glencore’s shares rose by 5% after the mining industry said it took $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a decline of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had put his rating on “sales” for the company.
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for half the year.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages threaten expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher working costs of its company, he says.
The cost could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappish 21 years old, a henfling with upper skid fresh.
The type with the platinum hairs is 100 million euros hard.
Even more.
Currently is Monsieur Bieber in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is running through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name \"Ritz Carlton\".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
It includes Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the pole has been sitting on the cold stone plates in the form of Berlin luxury hotel at the Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here is your idol, whose posters are hanging up in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite, where the Canadian singer lives, costs exactly as much in the day as her mother Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
He said, \"In fact, my Wiktoria had to sit in the tenth grade in high school -
“I’ll fill her with a dream.
School duty?
Who's itching?
The fans are not.
Nor does Bieber himself.
He's taken care of anyway.
For advertising at the Superbowl's advertising break, he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel device washing many, many dollars on the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like he and over the store table, Bieber also cashes.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you stand on the window pane.
More than 100 million are to be exploited.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is now in the United States and the UK with his new single “What Do You Mean” at number 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida Plakat brings Lebanese to potato dough idea
The potatoes or the doughs?
It goes both - in the potato döner, which the Oldenburg Imbis owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the saying “Cartoffel instead of dons” on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay has put potatoes and meat together on a menu.
The idea brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription “Cartoffels instead of Dons” he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, in his store, a grill is turned, fitted with meat and potatoes.
“This is multiculti for the stomach,” says Alhay.
The idea has now been submitted to the Lebanese patent office in Munich.
There, according to the authority, it has been recently protected as a pattern of use.
How much meat and how much potatoes the pie contains, Alhay doesn't want to betray.
Just as much: “It tastes even better together,” he finds.
The culinary understanding is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches ground resistance campaign to combat Aldi incident
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branch from an aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $700 million aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media, as well as through events like Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as Ice Manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and shop owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
It is expected that Metcash will release further details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment will carry out his annual investor strategy day.
There is much to be said as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA charging stores and generate higher winning margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the Eastern States.
Purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoretic provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will cut off around five percent of the food market in these two states 12 months after opening its first markets and will remove all existing players, but mainly self-employed retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose 360 $ million sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that in the next year, Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and achieve a sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the amounts on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the Eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash’s sales in food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, and will reduce the market share from 14% in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14%, and income from Metcash’s food and food trade, which provides about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction at the same time pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million in order to compare sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products each week, and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and providing a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash’s chief manager, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustments and charging remediation programs will be put to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the \"collateral damage\" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented Duos, who is repeatedly referred to as \"Special Ks\", suffered from the notorious confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the judge, with Harrison calling out: “Wawrinka would have to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child.”
While he was last seen crushing a tennis striker after a crash claimed a potential US-open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against the UK.
“One thing about which I am quite envious about is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi was a little drawn into the dispute,” Healy said.
He broke a striker when he lost in the U.S. Open due to a crash, but he's not the first player to break up a hitter from frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, really, he's behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the relatively provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a little too strict.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the clothing field, he is training hard, he is good in form, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be paid according to his own merit.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the \"common decision\" as the right for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return as a long-term solid part to the team.
“First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think that Nick has made the rise very quickly, to which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside the crash light in which he can only think about it, I think it's right, and it's best for the team and it's the best for him.
Europe’s refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and reached the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get into the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-one's country and responded to Serbian officials with outrage.
The people who had fled from violence were trapped in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries for an unknown period of time, and had built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter swung over them, the migrants “opened the border” and shouted insults against the Hungarian willing police.
Some show back food and water from protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister declared it was “unacceptable” that migrants from Hungary would return, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbian) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the coming days - said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulences at the Hungarian-Serbian border came one day after the 28-nation block at a controversial meeting in Brussels, and no joint immigration policy was agreed.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed their hope that eventually, next month or by the end of the year, the EU states would adopt another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a European Union special summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent’s immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes in a brief action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so that they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants across the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were employed in the race to create the stack wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant engpass for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, and to the point of entry into the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the upcoming economic refugees who are looking for a better life, and not war refugees who are entitled to protection, are a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-metre (13-foot) high fence, which the government had built along the southern border to Serbia, a crime. These laws also set higher prison sentences for convicted human trafficking.
“Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency,” said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree with the military’s use, which is expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, a national security consultant for Orban, said that authorities have caught 45 people in trying to cross the border, 15 others had already entered the country deeper.
They come over by harming the fence, they are now in police custody and are charged with the prosecution of crimes according to the new laws.
The authorities are quick to repair the fence.
On Tuesday, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia, after a train wagon had arrived with barbed wire to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pushed a crowd to push in there.
About 20 were able to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection of Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they could enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead in front of Bernie Sanders in national survey halved
Former U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her over to the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre-elections (58 percent earlier), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will apply for the Presidential Office, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-election.
More than five months before the start of the pre-election, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS news survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while Sanders has achieved some gains.
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moderates, but these prophecies have decreased.
Their support for the men has been significantly sank, and Sanders is back here with only 5 points.
Clinton’s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years of age has been elusive, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
Clinton, however, has a big lead for the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with two-digit lead for the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead at this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the pre-election countries say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if she nominated from the party.
A quarter would support her with some reserves and another 15% would support her only because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
It may not be surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are particularly excited by her.
The views are more deeply mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them excitedly.
While 48 percent of pre-election democratic voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35%).
If Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why she wants her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters are also mentioned in connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent for dealing with the problems and selectability are also cited.
As the Vice President throws a potential for the Presidential Office into the scale, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not.
If democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
More than half of Clinton's followers say that Biden's second choice would be far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nomination of Democrats, Hillary Clinton's lead ahead of Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, this number of 78 percent has fallen last month.
Biden is a second in this measurement at a distance, but the percentage that sees it as the most selective has risen.
However, when asked what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about selectability.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the pre-elections is considered unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important features when electing the pre-elections of their party.
Most view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden best cuts off with the three candidates at honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of democratic voters don’t believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of it.
Democratic voters of the pre-elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server are continued as a foreign minister during the term, most Democratic voters of the pre-election are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions at all.
But it is a different story in the American public.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with their declaration, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton's general opinions, although 36 percent said that their opinion had yet to deteriorate.
It's mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views have become worse by Clinton.
Although Clinton is regarded as honest and trustworthy by their party voters, this is still a problem for them among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less than since May.
62 percent of voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the eligible nationally also see Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump receive good notes in leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush cut off the best in honesty.
A majority look at Sanders rather than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the applications of 351 Democratic voters in the pre-election is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson gets up close behind Donald Trump in a nationwide survey
Ben Carson is located at the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now lose half of the voter's support in the new survey, and others lose dramatically on hold.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers. Support grows from 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also revealed that Carson is well-arranged in demographic groups and that Trump surpasses higher education among Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the lowest, from 10% support in the last month to 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place.
The margin of error in the application of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson is rising in the polls - he lands at 19% support for Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
ABC News/Washington Post’s latest survey also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a carson rising last week, Trump found some side-hike for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Acceptable bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is already sufficient for bath holidayers to find warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea may be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer enter the sea: a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
On the other hand, bath temperatures continue to provide the Mediterranean: in the east, it is even up to 29 degrees.
In the Adria, it is at the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College newman
Almost two years after a student dies during a schianic ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, mortifications are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood attacked Chun-Michael-Deng during an introduction ritual in September 2013 brutally and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police reported.
Officials said he had been charged with connected eyes with a 30 pound backpack full of sand, and were repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng’s clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
“At this point, members began hiding Utensilien and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Deng,” Police Chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added with mute force injuries to the head, hull and thigh.
“At least one student has died from the Shikans every year since 1970,” said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family.
Brethren and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge for murder's third degree for the first five members.
Twenty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with shikanous attacks and formation of a criminal association.
“Not only do we want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this - official or informally - we will also take them into account,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has withdrawn its belonging to the local group.
This will happen if the Fed increases interest rates
An increase in interest rates is coming, and the houses are going to rise in swings, returns for bonds will rise, and the economy will slip into a recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long it will last and how long it will last.
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance on the outcome.
A recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial institutions react.
Thus, U.S. Central Bank representatives have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates, rather on the period required for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could find that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest rates.
“The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of ‘fair money’,” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a statement to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal heights, but still to low level to lead to the sixsome shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a historical trend based on how some areas of the economy might react:
As the market has seen in the last month, presumption of interest increases can make things more volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for asset gains to be dropped 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy,” said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the Fed’s interest rate increases.
More precisely, the market has been mostly up-to-date in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to an increase in interest rates, quite flat in the 250 days following ( average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal state after 500 days, with an average return in the past six previous cycles of 14.4% according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, Chief Investment Street at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and that the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that previously did not exist and that could accelerate a recession.
It is also noteworthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the event of a Fed interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rates since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect it to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rates in such a fragile economic setting could be risky and raise the question, whether it is different this time, the Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have taken on an interest rate increase in the Fed all year round, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategies and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, the future trade only gives a 25 percent probability.
“In our study, all increased cycles from 1950 to today have been in a supercycle with increasing vibration in GDP and pre-recession heights very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadow,” the report said.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatil, as the market is taking a rise in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that in the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when changing their strategic price.
In the case of bonds, the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase/reduction takes place in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bonds immediately fall, the Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies believe that the increase in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds to collapse and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although “we are still careful to expect higher yields,” Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more strict monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, credit tensions have expanded and the volatility has risen - all features of the market when the Fed strengthens its strategy.
In large and large, companies that develop the greater part of their business in the United States will benefit when interest rates rise and local products will be more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will get worse as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market as well as the financing of their debt.
“The story shows that “quality---based shares tend to respond very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet have averaged 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns as well as low-volatility in their shares also exceed their low-quality pendants by an average of 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points).
Debts become a big problem.
Businesses with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher earnings, even if experts are different in their opinion on how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for his “dumb”
He argues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said they just imitated The British
parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said it wasn’t very original.
BBC Radio 3 “turns” to Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he is doing something that the private broadcaster does not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public-law radio station was “dumby” and increasingly no longer distinguished from its commercial competitors.
\"Radio 3 seems - I use the word \"Damn - not like - but it seems to turn into Classic FM,\" he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be just under a different name.
So when you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually just imitate what’s already on the market, Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director-General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 lies far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3 I will never learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is really unsurpassed.
“And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to commission new works, I really consider it important, too,” he said.
Early this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that harder work must be done to engage the public than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not, however, the only element of BBC production that was under fire during the hearing of the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport.
The Tory-Affiliated Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced \"on special BBC-wise\".
He added that he wished the company would find “a hit from our house-to-house stable” when it started a series of entertainment next time.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of further series of The Voice in the future or spend money from the taxpayers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose slowly in August and Black Friday may be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe Black Friday has slowed expenses in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
“If you look at the growth rates for the previous year and go back to 2000 then this has always evolved over time,” Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG sales index told the Guardian.
He explained that the online sales intensified three years ago when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, e.g. at home on the sofa.
But now this is commuting, and we may experience that growth decreases.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the neglecting turnovers.
Experts believe that buyers hold back their purchases before this event, which takes place last Friday November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers cut their computers to make their cuts, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought for snuffs, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail consortium found that of £5 expenditure, a little more than £1 was spent online.
In some products such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now carried out via web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims buried in Mecca during the Kran accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims through the streets at the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia is putting the collapse to the last part of the huge Saudi bin load group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed at Mecca Grand Mosque.
Grievingly filled, largely dressed in white, the route to earn their respect when the first of the dead arrived at their last trip to the Al-Moaissem Peace Court.
The mourning procession passed over at the Holy Place, where only days earlier a bulwark fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then the prayerers.
The corpses were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanctions on the building company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 betters that were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already confirmed that the Haddsch to Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said the bin-laden group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state Saudi Press Agency, said the bin-charge group was responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company was prohibited abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crash of the crane, which crashed into an courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddsch, which occurred later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the cranes, and their representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal decree also co-operated with meteorologists because of non-current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia’s ruler family for decades and is taking over larger construction projects.
Al Qaida's deceased leader, Osama bin Laden, was an abducted son who was deposed by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people were hospitalized.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million Rial (£174,000) be paid to the members of the deceased and the same sum of permanently injured.
Other injured receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British are increasingly employing craftsman, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at artisans
At the same time, Kingfisher 60 B&Q will close sales sites nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that British lay down their hammers and brushs in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European artisans who carry out the work in their homes.
If you can handle using a hammer or brush to pick up walls, you’re apparently a minority today.
Because Britain is increasingly employing artisans to perform homework jobs in their homes, the company’s chief behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new manager of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has now been exceeded.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix Shops aimed at artisans and close 60 sales sites of B&Q.
Mrs. Laury said she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores, because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the employees are considering the men.
She said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that do more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, “It still works a majority of men in our branches.
We need to move this more to a balance.
Basically, half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of products by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a UK FTSE100 Index, has also distorted her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial board.
Mrs. Laury said: “This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher stated a decline in half-year profit and turnover after the group had shouldered the cost of closing stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
On Wednesday, the Court of Justice of Klagenfurt held two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice Champion Aich/Dob responsible for infidelity and interference.
The defendants did not know themselves guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was declared acquittal in May.
The current process was challenged.
According to Attorney-General Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it was crystallized that in the years 2006 to 2011 the defendants used funds from association accounts that they were allowed to disposition in their functions for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also charged with financial offences.
This fact kicked out the chairman of the Schöfensenat, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later time.
To reject the infidelity, the defense indicated that the association had at no time been a asset disadvantage.
The sports officials would only have calculated expenses and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had spent a lot of time and money out of debt - the passives amounted to around 600,000 shillings (r. 44,000 euros) in 2001.
“At that time, we faced the situation: to continue the club or to shut it down,” said one of the defendants, a large-scale auditor of the financial office in the bread profession.
With his colleagues and fellow prosecutors, he decided to take over this task.
With all the risks.
“We’ve put money in front of us, put our life insurances as security at the bank,” he said at the meeting.
The association agreed: You can manage the money freely, no debts can be made.
In addition, in the case of appropriate financial success, the payout of the expenditure damages was reimbursed until 1991.
Therefore, some of the expenses were paid only years later, i.e. from 2003 when a plus was on the account.
Therefore, there are also separate and non-detailed bookings, the former obman explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, the second defendant said.
Why the payouts were not disclosed to the club in detail, the judge asked.
The association has not been interested in the details of the financial gesture, but it has only been the freedom of debt, the answer said.
When an official investigation began in 2011 for abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association account.
That was a setback, the defendants explained.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association according to its statement.
“Why,” the judge wanted to know.
The interviewer knew no answer for a long time.
Then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The accused had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as a “harm recovery”.
Why damage?, the judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never been damaged.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, “With this you are all out of the tailor”
“I am a lawyer,” he asked.
In addition, the official said he never had a cent salary, he calculated he had only mile money and diets.
He charged the association 1,000 euros a month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
For the early years, the defendants could not provide accurate documents.
These were no longer preserved after a operational examination in which everything was considered to be correct, they declared.
The money was also the second defendant.
All the repairs were done in bar, and he had to travel from his place of residence to the bank to Bleiburg, he declared in his statement.
The main negotiations will continue on 23 September with the interrogation of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard strikes another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the loss of staff for three years, the computer giant will deplete further jobs when the company is split up.
The jobs in the U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) do not end.
As part of its restructuring, the U.S. Technology Group plans to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its company customer savings.
As a result, costs of $2.7 billion (2.4 billion) are to be saved, the company announced on Tuesday.
The move will lead to a special burden of around $2.7 billion, which will attack from the fourth quarter.
The decline of 55,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years.
HP employed around 302,000 employees at the end of the 2013/14 financial year.
Hewlett-Packard's stock was 2.3 percent.
The large-scale group of printers from the California Palo Alto is currently split up: the computer and printer business is to be merged into a new society, apart from the more forward-looking areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and the other services.
Both business parts are to be noted on the stock exchange.
A once again disappointing PC set and a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services was the second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo in the world.
In the third business quarter at the end of July, the sales of PCs and printers declined by 11.5%.
Sales fell by 8 percent to almost $25.4 billion.
The proceeds returned in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds to the change in the industry with a split-up and massive job cuts.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, has only recently responded to the fact that customers buy more smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans generally predict the degradation of around 55,000 places.
Conflicts: majority support the anti-IS mission
However, direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would largely result in rejection: 54% said, on the other hand, that 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying air attacks against IS in Iraq and Syria is 61% positive.
On the other hand, 24 percent are involved in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian ruler Baschar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent of them would.
29 percent could not decide.
Car: Second Press Day at the 66th IAA
The main focus of the trade fair is by September 27 connected, self-powered cars as well as electric mobility.
After two press days, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International automobile exhibition under the motto “Mobility”.
The wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organisers of the VDA Auto Association expect about 900 000 visitors as they did two years ago.
Röszke: outbreak of violence on Serbian-Hungarian border
On the Serbian border with Röszke, the Hungarian police used tear gas and water heaters against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported on the phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
Dahinter had formed a police line and behind the police station a water-lighter was available.
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officials initially used uninterrupted pepper spray.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards refugees.
This caused the group to be dissolved.
The refugees have been returning a little lately.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who had breathed the tear gas shouted.
Other refugees sat down together and left under breath.
The Serb police also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. bank
The world is watching when the U.S. note bank comes together on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not for the first time the interest rate has been raised for almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half who was still last week of the view that the Fed will do this now thinks that the Fed will endure a little longer and keep interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.25%.
It is a historic event because it has been seven years since the Fed put interest rates on NULL.
“For the first time, we’re approaching a situation where a large central bank might leave the zero area and start a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior employee at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good level of performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and only generate a small amount of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to turn to an increase, but the signs indicate that chances against such a step are good.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 AM MEZ on Thursday
Death protections at Delta State University left apologies
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before he shot and killed his colleagues later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he \"suffered\" at the first murder and wanted \"he could do it inconveniently,\" authorities announced on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a lecturer for geography and social science education at Delta State University, called for the emergency call number at 10:00 on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call center that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, \"I shot my wife last night, and he also mentioned that a \"sex dog\" is in the house but \"will never bother anyone\" but will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prenticeiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, who said: “I’m so sorry, I wanted to make it go back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “of course there was something in Mr Lamb’s idea.”
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prenticess also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday, there was no information, no evidence - for a \"threat relationship\"
Auertiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married for about seven years, as a \"good man.\"
The two were born 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentice had a daughter who is 19 and she was destroyed on the ground.
He said Prentiss was her daughter “absolutely best friends.”
Auertiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Auertiss.
Knowles said that Prenticess, who had a dog called Lightning, had met with Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help other people,” said Knowles.
Police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, \"He's not going to jail.\"
When police officers picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the forest, and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate in the spring of 2015 from Delta State University, according to his life on the university's website.
Stars Who Lost Their Lucky Ones
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, due to cancer.
The actor also alleged to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this certainly calls for his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is remodeling the Group
The Lufthansa plans a large group conversion.
Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save on its own with a better organization.
150 of the world's around 1000 executives will cost the company a job conversion.
With the pilot trade union there are new negotiations.
The Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evaluates the Eurowings budget.
The aim of the realignment is to contribute around 500 million euros a year from cost and redemption synergy, the airline announced on Wednesday.
There will be no board for the passenger business at the Lufthansa in the future.
The Eurowings airline will be developed as independently as possible for this purpose.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the board team around Chief Carsten Spohr.
With the new edition, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group plans to join Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
To date, the organization of the 120,000 employees was complex.
The airlines established under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which places three-quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with pilots
In the tariff conflict with the Pilots' Association of Cockpit (VC), negotiations are to be resumed this Thursday following the judicially stopped strike.
This was announced by the union.
The subject of the talks is to be the retirement arrangement for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve portable results as quickly as possible in a year with a forecasted record result.
The conflict between trade union and airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transition supply of the pilots, the saving concept is “Wings”
In the fight against competitors, the Lufthansa is outsourced on the Eurowings Group’s own budget line.
Under the title \"Tomorrow in the South\", paintings by Leena Krüger can be seen in the artist's house.
The Finnin, already established in Göttingen for a long time, has put together a selection of titleless work for the White Hall of the House, which will enable its viewers to make a thought-provoking journey.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United cannot play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at Manchester Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left outside defender to wine and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hoping Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said, “He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital.”
He will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operating in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 and has it very hard and then plays fantasticly, and then it happens.
In the dressing cabin he had an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and hanging an elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the judge, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian judge had been wrong.
You can judge for yourself if I say an elfmeter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw’s account was: “I thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my path to healing begins now, I will come back stronger —
Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
With the European Championship in France, the English defender has an added incentive to recover until the next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: “It’s a very bad injury.
If a player leaves the place with this kind of injury, all are very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
“He’s doing very hard because it wasn’t his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you hear that it’s a very bad injury, that’s not good,” Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows the Lorax better.
It’s one thing all parents learn soon: If your child loves a book, it won’t take long until you know it almost externally.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, the environmental fable of Dr. Seuss, decided in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company’s SuperCamps website, and continues: “Lost, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it’s a book I like to read to my children, because there seems to be always a picture or message we missed so far.
Everything is beautiful and good, except that the following paragraph, where Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book, instead displays a content specification of the 2012 film version, added the new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text.
“In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a ware, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by his desire to see a real tree, will be satisfied.
The text provided by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax movie presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins: “In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams —
Although he admits to being a cardiovascular father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the book’s action. Here, an unnamed boy, like the local environment by the money-hungry, tree-falling, Thneed-stricking one-ler is destroyed in spite of the protests of the so-called lorax, a horrendous, thorny creature, speaking in the name of the trees.
It is likely that such a relatively low PR order was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times after each other to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it's still difficult
To push Pakistan into the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the frame that England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test Series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude an outward victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting creation, and the community spirit is strong; they will not bear scars of 2012, only a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth separates from the England test framework and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth, of course, is difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, there - and I've said this before - players are their own best pickers.
Long ago, one had extended the course of Lyth, but he had control of his own destiny.
If he hopefully beats out more runs for Yorkshire, another chance comes.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not provide such good performance, and that doesn’t surprise me; he’s primarily a team man.
The question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his sign is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only prelude that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a drummer I highly esteem.
He is an X factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge, which hit us very much.
He must get at least the same chances as those before him, but this, of course, depends on the team's creation in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen hit next to Cook, which would give an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a drummer can't hit there, and this left-hander has already shown that he's a devil's candle of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He managed three hundred runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the frame as a backup spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he has impressed me very much as a young man.
People may be looking at his statistics - an average of 31 with the striker and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's no large number of backup spiners that raise their hands and the coaches have decided for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made a few clever supplements at the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the Test Games could be a master's coup.
He is one of the best guys in the game who will bring a lot of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup.
I have always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing cabin, even if the news is in line with the previous one.
Collys teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Dayers, Red received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and teammates will not determine the timetable.
And you need to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made easily.
Brexit store (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could win in run-up if the economy was in a flute by 2017
David Cameron’s unexplored new negotiations strategy to keep Britain in the EU is becoming more difficult every day, even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy — Is it Yes or No — Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, which is raging violently due to Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend said that some member states, as deeply intertwined in various crises as the EU has once done and not always out of their own fault, have been filled with split commitments and disturbing contractual changes that they do not want to do.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it even if it endangers social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb at summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants a UK looking outside inside the EU tent - \"Let's not leave with France alone - says Berlin - and let's see if more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautiously appointed chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as it has happened to the exaggerated long endurances such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a blundering force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will be cut out a leg to help the selfie britt whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland’s exit from the UK — something they don’t want because most similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even deliberately plan unhelpful remarks, entirely in the SNP style, during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
\"The renegotiation was a pleite - and \"Great Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiable\"
Europeans know how ruby the Fleet Street can be at its expense and which EU sceptic is the oligarchy of the press barons, as it was during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can easily recall Boris Johnson, the Orz-Euro opportunist who made a name for himself as a “EU-Gerade-Banan” Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
At all his insanity, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the medley of tax-fearing shurks, telephone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo non-inlanders, which most of our major newspapers have.
In fact, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but noted that when you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distribute bananas to distract him, rather than become his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum swirling, for Blair had laid down the principle of the EU's unacceptable constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which thus opened a back door to him.
The press never let him go.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly clapp on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needed time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake at the time and today.
It may take, but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I express it kindly - in development.
He said we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukips are traditional blue dye trend and the wilder felts of Torys Klein-Englandism can say yes to everyone.
It’s what Hilary — A Benn, but not a Bennite — said Benn on radio and on television this week when the roadfinder in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn’s appointment of the provocationist John McDonnell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried to be illoyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to remain \"under all circumstances\" - Benn's expression - wasn't what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his opponents and MPs after all reports at their Monday evening conference.
Whatever Corbyn’s rostery bottom-up image wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and, above all, in the strudle of social media, a breeding place of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s right to not give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to hold Labour’s support in the referendum campaign for a naturality, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic multi-reliance to EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for which narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his multiplicity to NATO - Tom Watson is rock-proofly convinced that JC does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in all.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make loans to the British if this can be pointless?
The U.S. has already been quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded at the start of Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England's report on e-cigarettes
According to a state-funded agency, e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “found report” last month and described it as a “substantial review of the evidence”
However, some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and point to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A guide article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the “extremely windy basis” on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers wrote in BMJ and asked if the allegations were \"building on stone or sand\"
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said that the public expects that PHE’s claim that “the most current estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” is based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who have been called in to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to lead their opinions on the damage of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director was to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s reference to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting declared that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding they would have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, according to reports.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the body will not be provided, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting also took part in the tobacco administration of PHE.
The group’s research work “understands that there is a lack of “hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria,” wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's allegations that \"there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smoking\".
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ’s allegations had already been responded.
He said, “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
Every second life-long smoker dies of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what it does not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System £2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not at risk, but only represent a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfill our national jurisdiction.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former chief of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, saying commercial rivals would \"give their right arm\" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs that are likely seen by a smaller audience in hard-hitting time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and of broadcasters like BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with the BBC during Channel 4 for six years.
“I have problems with the idea that BBC is giving or sending programs that would also clearly show non-subsidized rivals,” Johnson told the Board of Communications as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I don’t consider a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least give its production on programs that others don’t do or commissioned.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course nonsense.
Johnson said, “I don’t see why a regressive tax program can be funded that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, adding both of its own productions.
In fact, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I try to see how this should be public-law television.
I don't think that would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC is guilty of hunting for reviews — because of the ambitions of people working there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support.
His comments on the BBC’s most popular broadcasts reveal what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-law niche programs should go to BBC4, where you can't quite measure the audience, but they fulfill their tasks, and they can argue if they go on their seemingly sacred missions to justify £4 billion of broadcasting fees, \"Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that no one has seen\"
They put it in a time window where no one ever wanted to see it.
For the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: “I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who can get the best value out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a great value for £150 a year here, but for people who are a lot of money for the £150, ask me if that is true, because they don’t consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also said in front of the Committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review their Reithian mission, \"to inform, form and entertain\"
He said little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it is 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and it should take an example of changing this to \"inform, educate and entertain\" to public television stations in Australia and Canada.
For the partnership’s question, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the proms, of which he said that only one handful is shown on television, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
Sonogenics can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction in which they are irradiated with sound impulses that have high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by turning on Motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Further on this subject: researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new process called sonogenetics in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep-hirrification, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fadenworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air blows.
The blaze, he found, strengthened the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes by some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically changed the worms so that some of their motoneurones carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When applied to the modified creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the microblades and transferred to the worms where they turn on the modified motoneurons.
The process has some similarities to optogenetics, a ground-breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neurons with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics might have some advantages over this technology.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down to the desired site in the brain at an optical fiber, low frequency-ultrasonic waves can pass tissue unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
“We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments,” Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The ads shame Britain’s arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Shows Video.
Frightened murder drones!
Footgear crushing legs!
Strictly bombs!
And electric shocks that cause painful pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest arms trade is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the willingness of the British government to crush weapons to repressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains that require a second look.
\"Important announcement: From 15 to 18 September with DLR (Docklands Light Railway), you can read the London Underground fonts and the DLR line markings that are changing to the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will drive with the DLR... Customers will be asked to help with the stop of the weapons trade fair.
The 300 posters are from artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped spread in London and used “Ad Space Hack Packs” a £6 package of inbus keys, which is claimed to gain access to about a third of the bus stops advertising areas on the planet.
Transport for London finds this poster “Vandalism” not fun.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will be more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-weapons trading plates greets the pendlers in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profitly with the graphic and voiceover artist, who also works free of charge.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence surrounding the advertising for the arms trade - by an empty spot of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid”
They played with the invention of a more realistic two-light company advertising, but \"by inblowing with bright colors and animation, it remains more secure.\"
“They have done a fantastic job by helping us to sharpen awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair,” says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an entry into the British government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be carried out illegally in front of our doorway.
Perhaps the most creative art around the weapons trade fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where cardiovascular fantastic euphemistic products sharpen.

Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved into a student’s home, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I’ve been angry with - and the numerous, long-suffering complaints about others.
Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entry into student dwellings ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely frightening.
It’s tempting to sweat: people tell you where you come from, whether and where you took a Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you “honestly say Marmite doesn’t love or hate, because in earnest, boy, it’s just a yeast extract HAHA, I’m in my room.”
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like as opposed to those you wouldn’t talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and these fire extinguishers were.
Let people go.
People’s rooms are often transformed into beverage receptions, film night venues and municipal meeting places, but they are also the places where people are attracted and their underwear.
In this regard: Do not think about starting a relationship at the university
Introverts receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a space-to-space bummel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, “I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so I get the energy I’ve spent on the interaction with you.”
Try to feel when a comilitone is exhausted from social - and send him an SMS instead of knocking on it.
Apropos knock on: Do it.
A guy in my student home had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship closes by baking.
As you start the university at the peak of the back mania, knocking on the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of Brownies is less strange than the welcome of the 1950s “Welcome to the neighborhood, I’ve made something for you. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions.
Offering house-made delights is a good way to make friendships.
Your residents feel obliged to talk to each other and may end up associating your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Bad mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, clawing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
The chances are that they will say to serve themselves even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to handle it more balanced than my fellow residents who added to their milk a dish to punish theft.
She's in prison now.
You should not make noise that stops people from sleeping or working.
It’s not just about being a decent person, but that in the truest sense of the proverb, you belong to the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl on my floor asked her neighbors if it would make them a bit quieter, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5:00 p.m., they kindly let their neighbors sleep for two more hours before making their own music, shut down their door, and finished their three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse accidentally moved into the same student home?
Conversely, if you hold a cohabitant for your future spouse, get involved with them, divorce them again, and then have to see them every day and perhaps experience how they overtake all common friends?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot cohabitant is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to persuade your underage a little reason.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unclosed room, the border between an ulk and mobbing is finer than it seems.
A good strike is fun, but it only takes moments until it becomes the boomerang.
Share a valuable and enjoyable lesson about safety by hiding - but never fix someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their door, and place their keys in a glass of water, which you then place in the freezing cabinet - but take their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice.
Rowhouses for refugees, single-teachers, low-servicers
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in the middle-ranking corner row houses for people who don’t have a lot of money.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: \"Not only do refugees need living space, but also the single-parent and the low-serving -
“I show you how to build cheaply and well today,” says the 44-year-old in the interview.
Thousands of refugees are forced into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes in knowing how fast cheap housing can be created: he builds in a project series houses for refugees.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees are forced into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or turnhalls has no sustainability.
People stay here for a lot of time.
In view of the refugee stream, we also need sufficient housing over the next few decades.
A very banal, three-story row house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs the least space.
It makes integration easier.
This is different if people are accommodated in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses just built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price of 160 square meters of living area per house is 184,000 euros, without property.
That's supervisable.
Six months of construction.
That's appropriate.
Have the construction regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I have successfully passed my project.
It is always particularly complicated to make the threatening steamoclesic value special construction and the setting arrangement.
Grussy.
It is still under way, who in a row house creates three apartments, needs at least three places.
Only in the cities lack the space for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the residents respond to their row house project?
Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What definitely isn't right.
But do you not strengthen the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True: In the last five years we have had a building tree in Germany, but have been built luxury apartments that can hardly afford more.
My project has the message, and the normal people also need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the minor.
I show you how to build well and cheaply today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially engaged in environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app, clicking on “General-Tip and then choosing “software update”.
If you are ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have been hit by problems after installation because they receive an error message that reports that the software update failed.
To deal with the problem, users are advised to either wait until the attack goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made this more unlikely by slimming the update, just as it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may be off half way off and this could result in a breakup of the update.

Rosberg's only choice: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the fight for the WM title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton just one more choice: “Full Attack”
The WM second emphasized before the start in the crucial seven overseas races, “that I have nothing to lose.”
53 points separate the Vice World Champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and double champion Hamilton.
The British have already won seven of the previous 12 seasons and are also taking on the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will influence Singapore's Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a dark bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club, Bad Kissingen, founded three months ago, recorded another member in its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is a member of the Bundesverdienstkreuz 1st class and honorary citizens of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation that was accepted by Chairman Alfred Klein.
It is therefore possible to include chess players who cannot apply for a member contribution.
Youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club “Red-White” be seen as an expression of his association with the Kurstadt.
Quartz Office Finds Direct Contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonispin have joined together under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new starting point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to advice, you can also participate in courses there.
The Social Foundation draws it from the mountain to the city centre.
More precisely, at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and consultants will receive information on such issues as care insurance or health care services.
For years, with our ambulance care service, we have found that caring members are often left alone.
There are endlessly many questions.
“Even though most of the cash is rarely used because the complexity of insurance is not yet understood, the new house manager Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antoni Foundation and the civil hospital and the ambulance service Amadeus, explained.
In addition to the advice, the new VAT office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
To this end, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as stumbling prevention, memory training or physiological treatment.
The offers from the Senior Centre and Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, precaution and reha.
“The Senior Centre for Care and Care,” said Heike Riedel, managing director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new headquarters in the city centre is that both managers see particularly in demographic change.
Because this made a good decentralized infrastructure essential in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the inauguration ceremonies, the Agency also dedicated itself to the Association in the age of: “There are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular social presence.
The Social Foundation thus makes a significant contribution to the ability of seniors to live as independently and well in their familiar environment as possible.
The airport office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9am to 14pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 16am to 18pm and Saturdays from 10pm to 12pm.
Eintracht Bamberg v Würzburger Kickers on October 6
Now it is official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-party Ligat Würzburger Kickers was not yet set, the 6th October was now set as an appointment.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth finale of Bayerischen Football Totopocal against third-party Ligats FC Würzburger Kickers was now finalized.
Played on Tuesday, October 6, at 19 am at the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
“We are happy that we now know when the game is about the stage, now we have planning security - according to FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the now-started card pre-sale.
It’s something special for our team to play against a third party.
We therefore hope for numerous viewers, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams, FC Eintracht Bamberg won 1st FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against regionalist 1st FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Association Cup 2016/2017.
The title defender is a third-party discounter SpVgg underhaching.
Viennese architect Karl Mang 92-year-old deceased
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, as the artist's house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist's house lost an honorary member and at the same time \"one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna\" as it was in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952, he has worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Formation.
In the 1980s, he was assigned to the Austrian Theatre Museum with the establishment of the treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lobkowitz.
Park Punishment: Tim Wiese holds police officer with money
Former footballer Tim Wiese is not well noticed in Bremen.
Footballer was once, now Tim Wiese, an ex-national supervisor in Germany and committed to Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass, according to his own statement, is intended to have been added over the past two years.
In contrast, he did not use intellectually.
Wiese had just cut the hair in the city center when he saw a parking guard exhibiting a penalty for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wise then stormed out of the business, insulted the official and threw the due fine in front of her, as the “picture” newspaper reports.
In the city of Bremen, the allegations are confirmed, but the consequences of the unusual incident are not yet clear.
“The thing is still in the test,” it says from the city of Bremen.
Only then will decide whether or not the display will be shown.

Men blow on 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses seek police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at 23:45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One from the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, reportedly followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him.
At that time the group was at the height of the bft branch.
On the ground floor of the gas station, three people were also stopped.
One of these men then yelled at the young people and hit them face to face with the fist.
The victim suffered a nose fracture in this case and was bleeding heavily from the nose.
When his two friends grabbed and complained to the striker, he left his victim at first.
The injured young man was now brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car up to their apartment and passed it demonstrably several times.
When you saw the vehicle no longer, the injured went before the building to smoke a cigarette.
There, he was attacked again by the striker and another male person.
With the help of a batting stock, one struck the victim’s face and thighs.
The victim had to be taken to a hospital for the purpose of medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1,80 meters tall.
The second striker should have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and signatories to report to themselves under phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests €310000
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
In addition, Samtgemeindeer Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased.
In many places in the country, doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is fortunate: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retired, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still on the side of his successor in the next few months.
After a remodeling phase, Müller reopened the practice on October 12, until then he invested €310,000 in the premises at St. Marcellus Road 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, years ago, who is currently completing her professional training at the Verden hospital and wants to go into practice next year.
“We always had in mind that the garbageers would fit well into this practice,” says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
“If it was, I just called them.”
The couple of Müller enjoyed the idea of practicing their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
“The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us,” says the 39-year-old Müller.
“We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years.
He also sees the advantage of being his own boss soon.
And so one agreed, the Müllers bought the house with practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, the two-time family father Frank Müller also grew up, his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several doctoral practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently serving as a senior doctor in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed the leading notary in Diepholz County and is committed to the DRK department of Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September the practice will be prepared for the new chief.
While surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a house doctor, his genus Ursel (Internistin) has specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as house physicians.
“The endoscopy comes out,” says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic surveys as well as long-term and load EKGs and need a talk room more.
In addition, the EDV will be completely renewed.
A total sum of 50000 euros will be received by the Müllers in the context of a funding programme from the county (25000 euros) as well as by the Assembly (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
\"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued - stressed Samtgemeindeer Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients are entering the practice of Felstehausen every quarter, in the North German average practice there are about 500.
In Asendorf, there is another doctoral practice.
A positive side effect of the practice acquisition by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If she had not found a successor, she would have gone too.
By the way, those who visit Müller’s speech hours continue to look mainly at familiar faces: take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the Felstehausens.
With their farewell ends in Asendorf an era, the physicians have practiced there for 30 years.
“In the beginning, we had only two rooms, and Ursel Felstehausen remembers to be beautiful.
They feel a little tired after a long time.
“But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and many patients will still see a lot of patients,” says the internist.
Your husband adds, “We have a 6000-quadrate meter base piece.”
“I have always pushed myself before gardening, now it could be different.”
In addition, the couple has two grandsons and enjoys traveling.
Croatia: \"We let the refugees through -
“Now the border controls are also being raised at our southern border,” said Minister of Interior Johanna Mikl-Vierner.
Controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wishes to make an asylum application can do so “of course.”
The care and safety of the people are at the forefront.
It is clear, however, that “there is a need for clear signals,” the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept boundless migration flows, even across the Austrian-Slovene border.
It needs a controlled procedure.
Croatia considers 'Corridor' - Slovenia refuses
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also want to send refugees to Austria and Germany and may also establish corridors for refugees.
This was not the case with the interior minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is \"absolutely unacceptable - Slovenia will instead intensify the monitoring of the border, especially to Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, has already been strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area.
As the minister emphasized, Slovenin does not want to unravel his limits on refugees.
“Every EU member must fulfill its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work,” said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government reported, the first refugees had already been trying to travel past the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in Eastern Croatia during the night hours to escape registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick her up in nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have always been in the Croatian Tovarnik.
It mainly deals with Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country will account for about 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far taken migrants to the Hungarian border, would redirect to Croatia, reportedly agreeing to Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, argues that it is up to people to take certain routes: \"We can, nor do we want to, do it - it was.
According to the media reports, at least in the early days, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, and over the course of the day further buses were expected to arrive.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling throughout the night from the approximately 500 kilometers away Macedonian border through Serbia.
“We have heard that Hungary has closed, so the police told us that we should go here,” said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
As a result, the past Balkan route of Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbian Hungary could actually be expected by observers to come to a somewhat further western route.
Croatia: \"Exemplary opportunities for border control\"
Croatia’s Interior Minister, Ostojic, had previously emphasized that in the event of a strong influx of refugees, his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member has \"overemphasis for border control\".
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, and since then EU partners have been making a good witness to the country about the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side behind the Hungarian border fence, there are still about 300 refugees.
According to Czech media reports, they spent the past night at the Horgos border crossing leading to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two Horgos and Backi Breg border crossings remain completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday early in a local warning signal in Horgos: he held the debates over alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not be very high refugee numbers at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun distributing maps to refugees on which alternative routes are signed by Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not uncommon: there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatia War in parts of the border area.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of miners in the border region had been sent.
Stock Exchange hackers: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is to have been among a ring of cybercriminals who have been accused of having repeatedly provided insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information used is intended to make insiders business in the financial markets.
In this way, the investigators were estimated to have raised more than $100 million in total.
“Today’s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are eventually caught,” the SEC said.
The trial against 32 other accused in the case took a long time.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are intended to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical hospital aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Manhattan Paradeplatz there is a regent operation.
People do their concerns, some quick steps, some cozyly bubbling.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim Autonalons at the Paradeplatz.
Stadtbahnen.
Pulsating, boasting life in magnificent autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large tables each with the headline “Before I die I want to die”...
The ecumenical hospital aid made this action focus on its 20-year existence and is clearly confronted with mixed reactions.
“It’s about life, so we went to the city with the action, and among the people,” says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospitzhelp is available to the passengers as well as to questions and conversations as well as to the honorary employees.
While some passersby occasionally attack the creed and can “buy my life” to read, “with the camper going through the U.S.,” “stop the war, or “do not suffer for a long time,” others remain short, read, say phrases like “so far I am not yet” and then go on.
Time and again, small discussions are developing at the edge about the action in itself, about life, dealing with death.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
“Only when I make it clear that at some point the end of this world is coming to an end, can I live responsiblely,” says the director of the Diaconian work, Mannheim, who is a carrier of the Ecumenical Hospitzhelp together with the Caritas Association.
Therefore, this public action is good for the 20-year-old.
That not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables, however, is understandable, and ultimately it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death has still been held with Tabus, the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospitism movement in recent years has contributed much to people’s opening.
An assessment that shares Angelika Godefroid.
The death and mourning companion is one of the first hour's employees.
Faced with personal experience with the subject, she read a lot of literature and decided to become involved in death aid.
When the Ecumenical Hospital was seeking honorary aid by call, she immediately reported and was present at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid is one of a team of 45 honorary women - 43 women and two men - accompanied by the affected and members in private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and the Hospit Saint Vincent.
All of them are carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her job and the experiences and experiences that are made.
“I see life from another waiting, think it’s precious and appreciate the moment,” she says.
The offer of the ambulance Ecumenical Hospital Service is free and confession-dependent.
The financial support of the health insurance and donations of members and associations enables the training and training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Every two years, training is offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Other personal wishes can also be noted on postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial outlook reduced for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant reduced its share of profits to an entire year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said earning a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey of FactSet.
In spite of the price increases, an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective on 4 January, and in spite of the higher additions for land transports of heavy and large packages that will be collected as of November.
The company said it still expects the result to increase over the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will bring solid benefits if you consider the weaker as expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade.
The plans for the holiday employment were announced a day later than those of the rival UPS, who plans to suspend 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share was $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, the twelve of Zacks Investment Research surveyed analysts predicted.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks surveyed analysts expected $112.23 billion.
FedEx has reported a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which brought sales into its unit Express shipping.
But the tree in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
Last quarter sales in soil transport rose by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices, while the result was lower due to higher working costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares dropped by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Strategies spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide if it is time to raise the lead interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Threatening over them at an end of the decorated, two-story session hall is a wall image of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation’s economic interests ahead of all other things.
The Central Bank has a twofold commission from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and to keep prices stable here.
But since the major recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too close to predicting it, and it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be eliminated by the unprecedented incentive due to the short-term interest rate near zero since the end of 2008.
Although most economic data show that it is growing solidly, the recent turbulences in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to increase this volatileness by increasing the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is also just a quarter of a percentage point.
“Of course, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for a precedent not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus as to what the Fed will do, which in itself is insecure to the financial market.
About half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
However, the financial markets expect to wait for the Fed, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the set unless the strategies melt the blow by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average rose by 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will keep up the set this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the sentences at that time, he said.
If she does, “they must go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic.”
Other experts argued that an interest rate increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed is going to act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on a good way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow deterioration of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that despite liberal complaints this year that more economic progress would be required, she expected an increase in the sentence.
Although the creation of jobs slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Pay increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy “can handle higher interest rates and need them because of the tension on the labour market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month, after China had downgraded its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% in May when investors feared that a slowing of the Chinese economy would droop global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the dow now being nearly 10% below the high of May.
For the Fed representatives, the market turbulences affect the complex calculation when you increase interest rates.
“If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have attracted the lines in this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. bank employee.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to get the effects better.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what the effects will be on the U.S. economy, and there’s almost no reliable data describing developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Fed, so it should not be included technically in its decision making.
But in the end, the Fed currency authority in the world has become.
The impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication of the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed can \"unite\" their monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can expect to monitor not only developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Her decision-making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for asset management at Envesnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that “the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are apparently not linked to economic fundamental data.”
Lacker, a voter member of the Federal Open Market Committee who is committed to an increase in interest rates, cited decisions in 1998/92 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its lead interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions, “as a result of limited visible impact on growth in the U.S.,” Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability at first during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Committee on the Bank of England’s Interests.
The latest turbulences do not come near this level, he said.
“She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are excited,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it is amended, I do not think it should advance time.

Hoyerswerda: Small Life Help for Refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To prepare you a warm welcome, do not go without the commitment of countless honorary helpers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support non-profit asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is with body and soul teacher.
She still enjoys teaching with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum camp at Dillinger Straße.
It helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from teaching at a proper school.
Brazil's pediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy silences
The Brazilian Pedagogical Organization SPRS tries to shock women about how important good nutrition is during the quiet period. She does this with the presentation of images of babies who suck at breasts painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Mother’s milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build up a strong immune system.
Due to additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher intake of calories is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernried Sports Hall
The Bernried Municipal Council approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flat for solar installation.
The plans for the long-awaited turnhall construction at the Bernrieder Sportgebouds are progressing step by step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the elaborate construction application was drawn to a close without great discussion.
Previously, the body had decided, among other things, to apply for a building legal exception, or, respectively, liberation, from the valid construction plan.
The “exception” was the permission for a special form of roof construction.
A Saturday with a non-medial first and roof oversight should therefore be built.
The background of the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar plants: “We get together a wonderful large south roof,” said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The 'freedom', in turn, was about the inclination of the roof, which, for energetic reasons - other than required in the construction plan - should be under ten degrees.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A 'freedom' was therefore necessary because the construction plan on roofing did not allow for \"exempts\" - where the Bernried community council is usually more restrictive in the case of liberation applications.
However, Turnhallenbau is not a recurring project: “We do not create a precedent case,” said Steigenberger.
Turnhallenbau am Sportzentrum is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
At a cost of around 2.3 million euros have been calculated.
Aids are expected from school and wide sports promotion.
In the next process step, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now submitted to the Landratamt for testing.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new medical director at Schongau Hospital.
The station as well as the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This provides the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county, which Landraatin Andrea Jochner-Weissen confirmed.
However, a decision is made by the Supervisory Board, and it will take place on the next Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans were implemented, then all of the almost 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to work.
The vast majority moved to Schongau with fishermen and the more existing inner station.
The rooms are there.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-Weitz.
The employees are informed of the plans.
The change triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been a medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year, and is now changing to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
In the question of who should follow, according to Jochner-Wissen, the name \"Fischer\" came into play, who was willing to take the lead from October 1 and switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case a 'upgradment' and a spread of the offer in the field of 'Inner Medicine', according to Jochner-Wissen.
Fischer is a specialist in heart-step makers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
For the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board approves to run both houses, should finally be closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years, until the next year the former hospital of the Knappship, which still has 35 beds.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018 when the current renovation at the Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Landraatin Jochner-Wweiss, who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board, countered rumors, after which the house, which is owned by the Federal Knopf, is to be used as an accommodation for asylum users in the future.
“That’s what I’m going to do: As with the property, Jochner-White could not say there are several considerations.
At present there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a daily psychiatric.
\"What betters could not happen to us, such an opportunity will not come again - so fishermen have been taken over by the quasi movement to the Lech, which has been recorded by the employees - positive and very understanding.
A real perspective for the house where fisherman has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years has not been given.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the position of the Director-General.
The Peißenberg Hospital (one hundred beds) has been repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, such as surgery and birth aid.
The handballers of the Rhein-Neckar Lions are required tonight (20.15 p.m.) at the Bergische HC.
Although the table leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, there is no cause for exaggeration.
Last season, the bathers at BHC had a painful defeat and had something to do with it.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractors were seriously injured by shots during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the aberntens on a cornfield near Pratau (Witenberg County), several hunters were in use as police reported.
After a shooting, a 63-year-old man suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospitals.
How exactly it could have been to the accident was not clear at first.
The criminal police determined.
Lost 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Violence
A suspect has led police to the body of 16-year-olds missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
During the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing youths and throwing her body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old man from North Rhineland-Palatinate has been a victim of a crime of violence since Saturday.
The young woman’s body was found in Rockenhausen at Kaiserslautern on Tuesday evening, as prosecutors and police told him on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old also arrested on Tuesday night, who confirmed the act and led the investigators to the foundation of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after not coming home as agreed on the night after a visit to a autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
When looking for the young woman, the investigators first hit the victim’s personal objects.
In the case of interviews in the friend and acquaintance circle of the missing, a suspect of the 20-year-old finally emerged.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to police interrogation, the arrester admitted to the authorities that 16-year-olds were killed and the body was placed in the canal.
The 20-year-old should be led to the arrest judge on Wednesday, the investigators charge him death.
Disclosure over the closer circumstances of the act should bring the further investigations.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns of housing gap
The location on the German housing market is exciting.
More and more refugees are looking for a affordable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution battles in the German housing market have long begun.
With the upcoming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overburdened in many major cities.
They compete with weak-income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
In order to meet the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units had to be built by 2020.
This results in a study on behalf of the association's association - social housing -
For comparison: 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
This means that 140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in a first-class accommodation.
Many then enter the housing market and settle into the long snakes in front of the rental apartments.
According to Statistical Federal Office, however, in the last year less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increase in refugee numbers.
The study also poses significant obstacles in housing policy in recent years.
Germany faces an apartment deficit that is increasing from year to year.
Currently, around 770,000 housing units have been missing in the balding areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in emergency rooms in WG rooms.
Young adults remained unvoluntary in the \"Hotel Mama\" because of the flute in the housing market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per capita has been reduced for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the Alliance — Social Housing — proposes a restart.
New incentives to re-enhance social housing.
Thus, the basic income tax could be omitted and the basic tax for funded apartments could be suspended temporarily.
In addition, attractive tax writing opportunities are required according to the Alliance.
The support programme for refugee residences of the State Bank KfW is already well received in cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, on Monday evening, 184 million euros had already been retrieved more than half of the available around 300 million euros.
Now the project could even be raised.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridors
After Hungary, there is virtually no more income, as more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia.
Zagreb announces to give the passage through Slovenia to the north without any obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to get to know the neighboring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
“I have spoken to the Slovene Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor,” said the Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the OER Zone.
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a OER country.
After the shooting down of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees to Croatia have broken up to get to Western Europe.
500 people have come across the Tovarnik border, the Croatian television station RTL reports.
Hungary had closed its border on refugees on the previous day.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, in addition make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to let refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: “You can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity.
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who do not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had raided the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighboring country of Croatia in the morning.
Most of the media reports came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They arrived both by bus and with taxes in the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they had tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees did not cross the border.
For this, the border strip has other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslavian Civil War in the 90s.
Mining spacers should quickly create a safe passage.
After Hungary closed the border, there was little more refugees.
On Tuesday, police counted 366 people arrested.
Shortly before the closure on Monday, there were 9380.
The new Hungarian laws staged the conquest and damage of the border fence as a crime.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings were introduced.
The convicted threatened prison sentences up to five years and the expulsion from the country.
On Tuesday, according to the Immigration Authority, there have been a total of 94 asylum applications received in the newly established transitzones on Tuesday, of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees had stopped there.
In practice, however, no one has a chance to get asylum in Hungary.
In the Hungarian view, Serbia is a “safe third country”
The rejected asylum seekers are to be expelled there.
Just a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the “Transit Zone” in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers began cleaning up with it.
They gathered the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Lock-gitters were decommissioned and one of the receiving bearings in the border site was rebuilt.
For the purpose of this conversion, no one wanted to express himself.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria only a few refugees are reached.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants remained in the country, however.
In Salzburg about 1,400 people are waiting for the departure to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped on the eve of German authorities.
In release, smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot.
Mayors drove “Stranded” across the border
“We were busy cleaning up after the festival of the bridge on Sunday, when suddenly ten people with travel bags stood at the entrance of the tent,” said Wernstein’s mayor, Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted by train to Passau.
However, because of the refugee flow of Germany on Sunday, the railway with Austria was surprised, for them it was closed in Wernstein, so Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the stranded along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the Near Passau.
Previously, we had bought the unexpected guests once, with Jause and drinks.
We said we'd take them by car to Passau.
“That was of course for us,” Stadler said in an OÖN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man could not take a generous donation - 100 euros for the firearm.
“We were very happy about that,” Stadler said.
The stranded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train towards Passau on Sunday evening to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that train traffic to Germany had been suspended.
However, the regional train was decommissioned before the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border generally is high in the course.
The Brückenfeste associated with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday is a social highlight, a two-bridge sporting run on the day before - organized by the Union of Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends other zig thousands to us is a logical result of a seemingly holy policy:
Instead of immediately helping in the construction of structures to ensure humanity in the Röszke camp, our federal chancellor has officially and publicly expressed the attitude of the Hungarian government in the dark circle of nationalism.
The suffering of this policy is not only the Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees also need to find out that the “believing land” that they have invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the ongoing flow of refugees and the approaching winter, to produce human-worthy conditions for seekers of protection.
And it will be an even bigger one - maintaining peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof quarries
Konrad has to do all his hands with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up budgets for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording centre Traiskirchen has already got Konrad in touch.
“We no longer have homeless homes in Traiskirchen,” he reported of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was also without great concern, Konrad said and praised the organizational \"master performance\"
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a “crisis-like situation”
In total, Konrad expects 85,000 millimetres a year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodation needs to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be provided to the countries, 15,000 of the Federation.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
“But it’s not a barrel without ground,” Konrad said.
He has already spoken with the heads of the state.
They would have assured him that they would also be able to create for the future refugees.
“In Upper Austria it’s going well,” Ferry Maier said.
The former VP mandater supports Konrad.
In the morning there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, which will explain how the church will help.
Big expectations also put the Asylum coordinator in the ORF action “Helps Like Us”
On the platform, private individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, you hope for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized the standards of accommodation as 'very high' yesterday.
In times of need, it may not be possible for brushers to maintain a certain height of the towel holders or size of the upper lights.
For a limited period of time, “notable standards” must apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, Konrad based his experience.
I am an older man who is not told the truth without anything else in the face.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause any costs to the Republic as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their staff to three to four.
Her own self-sacrificing search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are apparently problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
In the past no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees plans the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, since the affected can currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, for the case of the emergency, further locations should be examined for their virginity.
The head of the city is critical of the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: \"No borders are locked -
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), the head of state Josef Pühringer (VP) came to a close on Monday.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be locked.
The further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there is now the corresponding border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist.
However, the seekers of protection would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
Leaders from other EU Member States once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue.
The fact that Austria also re-enters control at its borders is a logical consequence for pühringers from the process of the Germans.
The Next Runtastic is a Question of Time
The general restoration of the new yard in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the partner-notated IT Group S&T, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
“In IT, the smart heads are our raw materials - and we have to try to work for us,” says S&T chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New yard and later acquire any.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - some of which Niederhauser promises: “The next runtastic is just a question of time”
1.7 million Euros were invested by S&T in the location, 3.3 million Euros from the Techcenter, each of which belongs to a third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Republic (FFG).
The building is dedicated to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years by Linz AG.
30 per cent of the 2,700 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented, for another 40 per cent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni owner opened second store in the arcade
In the new shop, Furla handbags are at the center.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to lay down a dog.
This project had to put up the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the pigeon market arcade for a short time: she has now gained growth in the form of another business location.
In the Furla store compared to the store in which they sell bags, suitcases, shoes and gear from different manufacturers, everything turns out to have women's handbags of the Furla brand, money bags are from 75 euros.
Greater bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday, the new shop has been in operation.
A few weeks ago, it was rebuilt.
“I’ve been thinking for a long time about whether to open another store,” Breit says.
The decision was decisive, among other things, that the Furla producers at home in Bologna were also anchored by the idea of a private location where only their handbags are sold.
“We’re the only ones in the large area of Linz who sell this brand,” says the mother of two daughters who owns Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been put into the eye by her mother.
I think most of the time when something is developing and I can show new trends at reasonable prices.
Why so many women, when they look at a beautiful handbag, are not able to answer with the latest certainty.
Perhaps it’s because a beautiful bag is uplifting every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The palace ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called providers.
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become U.S. president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for rioters.
Whether he expresses himself externally, journalists argue, or reveals gaps of knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. President's Office strongly calls for the election campaign.
And cut it well.
This is also recorded in the Polish Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire came from.
The New Yorker with the Föhfrisur is a term many in the Winzerdorf on the Weinstraße.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant location are related to it over -zig corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in election mode.
Simone Wendel filmed a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
“I think those who find this somewhat exciting, but in their Kallstadt kind, are also not so deeply impressed,” says Simone Wendel.
The birthed Kallstadterin has filmed an enjoyable documentary about the place and its famous sprayers, including Trump's Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also comes to the fore in “Kings of Kallstadt” (2014) with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the king of the heart.
While there is respect for the family’s performance, it also tends to think that Trump is “a little bit of a big deal,” Wendel says.
Randomly, the nickname, which Kallstadt has in the circuit, \"The Brulljesmacher\" - to German: the provider, she says.
Trump comes from the village of the suppliers.
Trump’s success story began in 1885, when the late grandfather emigrated and opened a site for gold graves in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate group was the first property purchases in New York.
But the lives of the grandparents were not free of tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
He did not take up Trump because he had once been dismissed without permission, the director of the Institute of Papal History and Volkskunde, Roland Paul, had declared the film launch.
Trump is the grandson of a \"illegal immigrant\"
This is in contrast to the mercenary statements of the afterlife.
He had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
“Like the poultice, this isn’t so sympathetic,” says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump, “The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandfather was born Heinz.”
The winner in retirement sees the American beggar, \"he's always so exciting\"
Does he believe Trump is coming?
“I can’t imagine that,” says the 72-year-old.
\"He never cared about Kallstadt.\"
The pension manager Veronika Schramm mentions as some Kallstadters that a descendant of the Heinz family, upon a visit, donated something for the church's norson, which was generally well received.
“I can’t imagine that from Donald,” says the 68-year-old.
They think it's better if he doesn't win the election because \"he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good\"
If those who had said this in the U.S. at the time of his grandfather would have been like him, “if he had never arrived there,”
“There are more interesting topics than him,” says Winzer’s daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
“My president is not,” she says.
And: “The grapes will also mature without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, which was long interviewed by Trump, saw 12,000 cinematists, also in the United States, awakening interest.
The upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first \"Bergsteigerdorf\"
From the hand of the Vice President at the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabiter village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 mountain resorts in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association there is responsible for awarding the award.
A \"Bergsteigerdorf\" may have a maximum population of 2,500.
At least a fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rushed to Canberra to report the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it did not make any major shifts in today’s reviews.
Nine’s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull created Tony Abbott’s crash.
The rival Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a one-week series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers among the five capital cities, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase in ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind from the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, today there were an average of 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for checking!

The great novelty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear “Yes”
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and easily hit The Block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30 p.m.) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 a.m. to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot-seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour, 720,000.
Hot-Seat averages 620,000.
The decline in the odds of the second evening of The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot-Seat will finally pass through at 17:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for millions of dollars minutes that didn’t make it to exceed the McGuires show.

The last three votes agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret reveals? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have been unaware of who won The Bachelor.
The woman, who eventually landed Sam Wood in The Bachelor, was caught in the biggest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not praise whether she is the one who received the last Rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons Fellows the day before three will be, you may accidentally have given an indication who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women left out in a lyrical way why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked “If not you, who should get Wood’s last Rose,” their answers could become the player who won the heart of the bachelor’s degree.
Jeavons Fellows and Markoski both quickly called themselves Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the first day.
“From the moment I went home and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam’s energies, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that throughout the show,” said Jeavons Fellows.
“Sarah stands with both feet on the earth, it makes so much fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said the house visit made her clear last week that Wood could be \"the one.\"
“As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game — I am now unreservedly set on him,” she said.
And when she was asked who would choose Wood, if not she, she was puzzled.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I love the remaining girls the same way - it's a disagreement between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 19:30 p.m., on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches had banned Hayne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a gerangel as it did the Aussie Rugby League conversion at his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point-return and also to the ongoing game after an injury from Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing cabin after the game.
Instead of milling his rookies before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fits at a point that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings game
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian succession had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the playing field quickly after the Fumble and later told Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career.
“That was a thing that happened now, you’re just taking care of the next game, and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his original debut in 2007, when a pass at his own in-goal range led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, however, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted for a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian wheelchair with gun force.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, seized his oil company Yukos, and banned his democratic efforts.
The Free voters are demanding the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high number of refugees.
Party and group chief Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn clausur in Großwallstadt of a severe crisis at Bayern's schools, when there are no appropriate new teachers for the many new students: \"We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing,\" Aiwanger said.
“At some point we will get rejections in the Bavarian education system.”
The Landtag Group of the Free Voters will be held in the under-franchised municipality until Friday.
In fact, very different main topics were provided.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the free voter meeting.
“Of course, the issue of asylum will overlaid the clause,” Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger demanded the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they did during the Yugoslavian Wars in the 1990s.
“So it doesn’t go on, we have to get to the causes,” said the Free Electoral Chief.
Abandoned asylum seekers want to drop the Free voters as soon as possible.
As a result, Aiwanger also requested more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: “We also need at least 50 new asylum judges,” Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticised that several federal states are not consistent: “We need federally uniform standards of the federal states.”
“Bayern is disembarking, others are not.”
“We need to be more able to act.”
However, national policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
In the new school year, Culture Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) at 47 gymnasiums has started the pilot trial - mid-level plus - in which an extension of the high school level of three to four years is tested - as a result it will take nine years to graduate again.
But this is not far enough.
“The theme of G9 needs to be accelerated,” said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all gymnasiums who want it.
Free ride at G9 wherever it is desired.

4 people killed after police shooting rubber shots at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber shots into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out in Rupandehi District on Tuesday evening, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, chief district officer, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before taking off on rubber shots.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber shots used, which are known to kill, but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The dispute was the last week of violent protests in Nepal’s southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus who wanted their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent disputes since the 10th century.
In August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted on certain clause in the Constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Building area planned in the city

Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement at the Little Sea at Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.

For months, behind closed doors was negotiated, gritted, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested person, the medium-sized emder company “System-Bau“, presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Emder Council’s urban development committee.
Initially, this point had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP Group, who favored the investor and the administration of intelligence, Ralf Behrends went from the system building business management to the offensive: “We don’t yet have an answer to all the questions,” he said to the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The €10 to €12 million project has been under discussion for months.
Huge reactions among sea-bud owners who came to the meeting, the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction called out.
Roberto Schulz, sea Buddhist owner and member of the board of directors in the interests of the prosecutors, Pro Hieve, complains: “This will be a giant plot that surpasses all the other builders.”
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would greatly increase by the intended size of the plant: “There must be a whole bus charge so that it will be calculated,” the report said.
What exactly happens on the well one-hectare area of the former guesthouse, however, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
“First we must have a key concept,” Ralf Behrends said.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans were still variable.
Twin-year-old at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased with its young people at its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Diana brought twins to the world yesterday.
Twin births are rare in Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years back and has also been in Frankfurt in 1967, it is called by the zoo.
The sex of newborn gorillas is not yet established, as Mother Dian keeps them close to the body so far.
At first, the “picture” had been reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday a wide low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verden islands predicted, which has a 60-percent chance of developing into a tropical spine in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, for example, in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical vertebral storm in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches duplicate donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double donation campaign to raise $111 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who overrolled the European nations as they fled war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach when announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
“Our journey included many dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and anxiety,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally collected donations will be doubled to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugee charity to $11 million.
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For easily overweight diabetes, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say if easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
“The mortality data takes a long time to show something,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote a guide to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, adipistas operations for treating type 2 diabetes have proved to be effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are ill-fated with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI of more than 30 are considered fatty.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach bypass and stomach tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained with those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments about the same time as 29.
Among those who underwent surgical surgery, 36% had diabetes completely and 28% partially.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes was completely resolved by only one percent and in part by only about two percent.
In addition, the results were better in the controls of blood pressure, the Triglyceride and the \"bad\" LDL cholesterol, in general, in the 'surgical' group, the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood level of cardiovascular A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Chromosome A1c is best held below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average cardiovascular A1c level dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better ‘glycemic control’ - as reflected in the improved A1c level of cardiovascular A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to leading researcher Dr. Chih-Ceng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compares average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas drawtomie group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater returns in the BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and cardiovascular A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded more complete victory of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was estimated that some 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients, Blackstone said it would be reassuring for individuals with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group, without increased risk of death or kidney disease,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long for people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think that once they have gathered these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult.
Love story plays in the Hunsrück
It is a topic that currently finds increased attention in the Belletrics: a young woman, at school hours unpopular and unsatisfied, again meets the swarm of her youth after years, and this one falls in love with her.
Similarly, in the recent novel “Really we are not so” by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love story, the novel may be of particular interest to Hunsrücker readers, as it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding localities.
The chief professional author grew up in Langweiler and rejoiced that she could set a literary monument to her hometown.
\"It's impossible that anyone can come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot take all refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the homelands of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, under the given circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents.
He also emphasized that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is commendable, but the situation is not appropriate.
“It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe,” he said.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria praised efforts to cope with the crisis, he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution.
“In order to care for several thousand refugees, it’s wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, how a real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries,” he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
“The use of violence has never solved these problems,” he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush’s actions after the September 11 terrorist attack, stating that the U.S.’s violent response was a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I expressed my regret in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in nonviolence.
“I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and this has produced unexpected consequences,” said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in use of hand-infectants by children in the last 4 years
Gift control centers in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow strong alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of intake of hand-infectants in children under the age of 12 who report poison control centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are more and more often coming to these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them are going to go into emergency care,” Lopez CNN said.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a courageous attempt at social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing mouth water to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
“A child doesn’t think this is bad for it,” Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, vine and orange fragrance, which are very appealing to children.
Hand-infectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In the case of young children, few injections can lead to alcohol poisoning.
“It is highly concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Gift Emergency Call Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, the Fox 4 transmitter in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn’t let Sluck Whisky stand around, but people leave these hand disinfectants in reach of children, and when children get to it, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four injections of fragranced hand-infection agents in the school after strawberry, was taken to an emergency hospital.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice the threshold considered to be drunk in an adult by law, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah called her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children’s hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and hit her head, Ritchey said.
“That was very frightening,” said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use non- alcoholic products or disinfective cloths and to store hand disinfectants outside the reach of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand-infectants that contained a toxic, unexplained drug.
Health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was noted as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-class students in New York State planned to poison their “common” teacher by explaining antibacterial products around the classroom, reports a police report.
The teacher is high-grade allergic to hand-infectants and expelled them from her room.
The police considered the abandoned plan to be “insanity” and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schweningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old car driver was easily injured in an accident on the cross-pange between the North Ring and the Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the cross-spange towards the county transport industry area and took note too late that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the circuit.
As a result, he bragged with his truck into the rear of an Audi and kicked this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta.
In the accident-inflicted vehicles, property damage of about 10 000 euros resulted, police said.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready and had to be dragged off.
Rumors: No Disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the speech of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hopes are in a bad place, but that he will turn again.
Hearts will fight SFA for the charge of Neilson and be warburton cautious in January-term obligations that could destroy the unity of the frame.
Dons increase leadership over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half gave Aberdeen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays talk about disharmony down
There are rumors about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was suddenly rejected by Griffiths, which insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control, as they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don’t think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: “In Holland, they don’t show any highlights of Celtic games anymore and why.
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what they’re interested in.
There’s a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I will turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian chief vows to turn things around.
After defeating Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat was followed by 10 men from Aberdeen, who now stand clear at the top of the table with five points ahead.
But Deila said, “Celtic had bad times before, and we’re going to come back.”
Now we want to get out as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel exactly that way - but we have to go on.
We really need, really, the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Being together now is so important.
Warburton cautious at January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, pointing out that he reached some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new entries and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox cadre.
Brentford’s ex-chief said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.
The players coming in summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you’ve seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal instructions
Swansea stormer Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation, has indicated that he can withdraw when his contract with the Swans runs out.
For two years, the 29-year-old has been plagued with an annoying knot and has not managed to complete the departure from Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA Battle set for Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1, when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Card of the Defender was later lifted - the third Red Card of Collum, which was recalled in eight months.
Neilson remains with what he said and insists: “I didn’t question integrity, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The unenhanceable Hibee was justified after he admitted to having sung a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a knee in the field of Roseburn of Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
“It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment,” said the stormer, adding: “It’s safe to say that I don’t return to Tynecastle if it doesn’t play for Celtic Glasgow.”
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United management

Derek McInnes boasts that his team from Aberdeen desperately had to fight against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory, which brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic on the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half.
McInnes said: “There is no team that has won everything, in pokal games or leagues that have not even won games of this kind.
Employment in Scotland remains unchanged as it increases in the UK overall.
The unemployment rate in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July, while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK’s 5.5 percent, as the figures of the National Statistics Office (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2.612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% over the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: “The long-term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It has been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Introverted Disruption
Since security personnel could not satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could officials take the troublers into account.
A respiratory alcohol test was found at a 16-year-old 0,89 permill.
The growing man was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 minutes and remained in custody at first.
Why I'm going to be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is brought to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I will sit in a spectator gallery in the death room in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison spray.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was first made in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to fear myself.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists may see executions in the United States, and since there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Those who are selected will observe it unfeelingly.
I can't.
I will sit next to Richard Glossips' closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison officials say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wishes, and you get access.
I complain to her.
She admitted that she could have done better, but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he would.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks the public work of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post reporter, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have made.
I don't want to go back to all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would blame him for being a benefactor of the deed.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can contact for.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded to come out of the Canning River after a dirty police chase.
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry when he talked to the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man of Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he found himself in good water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to \"slow him to return to the shore.\"
The Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday for a domestic peace break incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't come too far.
“He stood in the water and said, ‘I don’t come out, come and get me,’ said senior Sergeant Trader Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to make his uniform wet, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - \"A good police officer traded\"
“Sometimes people do fun things to try to escape,” said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, cousins drove his car into the graves to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to humorously plan a Ben Cousin Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy out him and threatened to finish racing
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they were carrying out a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's Late Scratching due to a racing day care, the last straw half on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media has always tried to do what is best for racing and he himself has found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt-tupper sample at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had held back 18 months because of the espionage allegations and did not want it \"look like too high hanging grapes\"
“I had to say nothing about it, and I’ve sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that everything comes out at once,” Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you respond, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around raised heads, and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don’t do that, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I do with my license.
Earlier, Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out its stable.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I will call when I’m asked to do so, and offered him employment in my stalls to provide information about what I’m doing within my stable,” Moody said on Racing.com.
They obviously believe that I am a fraudr.
If that is the case, they should certainly have been attached to their noses because they failed in trying to grasp me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still today.
Should this make me think it will be personal?
Does the RVL have fair behavior and maybe makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Perhaps people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I say will make them think about it now.
But I have now arrived at the point where I don’t care, and that makes me sad.
That really saddens me.
I will put pressure on them and force them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration level has been built up with the long-standing cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led to his saying that he could \"throw his license over the table\"
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, called the race day rule \"laughs\" after a pack of mud or sound was applied to the horse legs, which violated the rules.
“It’s against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
“One of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg.
It could have been so yesterday night.
It could have been that way throughout the day yesterday, whatever it was.
But it did so on the race day.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the pack on race day. An investigation of this issue was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules know nothing about the horse.
“We all see that we need rules, but here we went too far,” Moody said.
Man arrested by driver fleeing
The police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver in Cobram on the weekend.
The cyclist was delivered with the helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray-Valley highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia was sitting in Shepparton.
It is expected to be charged for driver fleeing and neglecting aid and for other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram remains in the hospital and is in a stable condition.
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy backs against rivals for allegations of ring fighting
Melbourne-Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of the tactics of his players \"Agenda setting\" by two NRL Premier League favourites.
Sydney Rooster's coach Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed the storm players \"ring fights\" with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney's qualifying final on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a hardly-hidden note to the storm team after his team won the final win against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening. He called the game a \"favourable example - the Rugby League and said the two from Queensland were not \"too good\" in the ring.
Bellamy defended his team's taillimg and said that they were only focused on their \"talking\" during the tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team was confident as it meant that they were worried about being hit by the storm team.
“That’s always coming up — I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they hit us 24:2” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has brought us the trend turn.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he’s probably not used to losing it, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It’s funny, as it always appears at this time of year.
Bellamy has attacked Bennett’s idea of “spanning football” and reminded his mentor that Bennett’s St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with “long-suffering” football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting her game was, Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he will take care of a shit draught.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this type of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit concerned about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16:12?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are you taking a break and not a point something exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will still meet them at a stage.
The storm team is free on this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday evening in the pre-finals at AAMI Park.
Cerber with $200,000 deposit after drug charge
A man who might be threatening a lifelong punishment for his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggling to Queensland was released against a deposit of $200,000.
Marko Maximovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drugs on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and installed in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was watched as he met his fellow prosecutors in the hunting port during the morning and later in the cafe Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life-long penalty for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maximovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the whole amount and that in the cafe it might have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maximovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia - he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather offered a deposit of $200,000 as security together to achieve his release.
“After reading the two people’s mutual statements, it is clear that the claim of security of $200,000 is a real financial burden,” said Judge Flanagan.
But this alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maximovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he left his Australian and Serbian passport, reported to the police daily and held himself to an exit bar of 18:00-06:00.

Stevan Hogg used girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone when she slept, log in to an online messaging service, from which he received a number of inappropriate pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping dog.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages, and immediately alarmed her mother.
Police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered “related” web research that used terms to search for inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it, as it would lead to “paedophiles on the Internet” and then “preceded to be a police officer to scare them.”
The state attorney Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: \"He said it would be a addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were done by him, but said it had happened because he claimed to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he drank, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: “When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was sitting and crying.
She also saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the disabled computer and play station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of indictment to have taken indecent images of children on 14 June last year, to have violated the lawsuits on 25 January this year and not to have appeared before court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one can argue that “no significant sexual element” can be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the ruling by October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bailout in this case, but was kept in investigation due to hearings on other cases still pending.
He was included in the directory of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Closers soft on small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being caught apart from the major control points at the German-Austrian border.
Many lockers caused fear of discovery and arrest to increase people on smaller border crossings
On the Austrian side out, a spokesperson for the Federal Police said.
Along the Inn border, more than 1,000 refugees have been captured in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and staves.
There they are received by federal police officers and sent to register.
At Münchner Hauptbahnhof, more refugees were reassigned to the Federal Police Department as compared to the start of the week on Wednesday.
By 8:00 a.m., around 700 people had arrived in the state capital, a spokesperson said in the morning.
After the re-entering of controls on the German-Austrian border, refugees had reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Runoffs from Tropensturm - Henry - in the south-west expected
Meteorologists warn of storms in the south-west of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area across Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) reported in Stuttgart.
The mighty depth is the foothills of the Tropical Storm (Henry), which has been drawn from the Bermuda Islands across the Atlantic in the past few days.
Huge storms and thunderstorms are expected mainly in Baden.
According to DWD, it is also in the Black Forest until Thursday morning, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance to expect trees of 60 to 90 hours.
On Friday, the sun can be seen for a long time.
The crowd does it: Every two years, the autobuilders on the IAA show their novelties.
2015 is mainly the movement of compact cars, which are currently very well-selling.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly requested: around 28.1% of new permits are decommissioned in August alone on this segment, according to the Kraftfahrt-Aueramt (KBA).
This is also reflected on the IAA (Federal Days 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new super-class and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is Opel Astra, which will be at the dealers in autumn.
“The Astra is an extremely important model for us,” said Opel chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive for it.
Opel offers an entry below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at €17650.
The current Astra costs 16 990 euros.
The Astra has a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the esses offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW, PS to 147 kW//200 hp, including three-cylinder-benziners for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only five-door.
As a second variant, the combination will follow in the spring, which can also be seen on the IAA.
And what will be going on next to the Astra on the IAA to new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-doorer in a conventional and a emphasized sporting GT version.
He will be trading in the beginning of next year, then also as a combination.
Infiniti: New in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan depositer wants to find its position with the new model in the highly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti is fully integrated into the brand’s design line with its forced lines.
The base model will receive a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
However, a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp is also available.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
Offers will be the model with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque according to manufacturer data is 170 Newton meters (Nm).
The sale start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but all around renewal is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën depositor were especially hand-in-hand on the front part: here, the cooling rigrill was re-drawed and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system has been modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touchscreen and for the first time integrated into Apple’s CarPlay.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are being added to the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are human unworthy
The Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex-keeper to the law firm Tegel, who had been housed in a too small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
Those affected can, according to the judges, hope for money even if they were locked in the too narrow spaces for only a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-keeper with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: he was housed in the Berlin-Tegel judicial facility between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor area; the toilet was not spaced.
After that, the man, according to his lawyer’s report, had been moved back to a larger cell.
His indictment charges for the unworthy terms of detention against the country of Berlin failed.
However, the Constitutional Courts upheld the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin and returned the case for re-examination there.
They see the man's human dignity hurt.
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were essential for the period in question, there was a compensation claim.
Otherwise, to fear a loathing of the legal protection of the personality would be to fear.
The Court of Chamber must now clarify the amount of compensation.
In the past, the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
So they only addressed a prisoner’s damages in April because he was naked locked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple installation of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy of human dignity.
In addition, on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court confirmed that a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 had certified a humane accommodation.
The claimant was housed between 15 to 21 hours a day in a cell similar to that in the Karlsruhe case for three months.
The Berlin prisons have also been in the headlines in recent weeks due to missing personnel.
The prisoners are therefore repeatedly included for 23 hours, the aggressiveness is increasing, even for beatings due to the tense situation.
After the judicial press release, 21 sites in brick have not been occupied due to minor shortages, 19 are to be removed in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the Refugee Policy: “We create it...
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the federal chancellor is determined to accept it.
What is going on in Germany?
About 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: “I say again and again: We can create it, and we create it.”
As far as Germany is concerned, give the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimation of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as is built (250,000 apartments).
Dramatically, however, the lack of living space is mainly in the case of affordable rentals: each year, 60,000 to 80,000 social apartments fall out of the rental price bond, and refugees will also apply for these particularly favorable apartments.
Federal Minister for Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to a billion euros.
There is little to do with this from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80,000 social apartments must be created annually, and for this, the federal government must invest in funding of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and federal construction ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates from the Institute for Employment and Professional Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not systematically ask for their qualification to help them get started, criticising Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, the integration of refugees is crucial if they are to find employment in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the recording society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt says.
In Germany, according to Dränhardt, there has been a political turning point: from the ban on work for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was previously a work ban for asylum seekers of up to five years, in November 2014, it was reduced to three months, as well as the residence obligation that asylum seekers were limited to a place of residence.
In society, even due to lack of skilled workers, the majority of people have adopted the view that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is lack of German knowledge.
So far, there has not been a sufficient supply of general and professional language courses.
In addition, studies show that jobs are most often given through personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore considered by Thränhardt of the King's Road for employment integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that few displaced parents give their children to the Kitas, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: “It is only once very important for parents to keep the family together,” says Ilja Koschembar, a spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, the administration distributes handset in various languages.
If the need for educators increased greatly by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity, for example by allowing more schools of expertise.
In the countries, students will be prepared for lessons without German knowledge in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stofters of the Berlin School Administration.
The German student work estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal asylum seekers or patient students prohibit the study - the only exception was so far Berlin, interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his attitude.
Students who are willing to study could be made easier to access to the university.
Because refugees with a residence permit or immersion no longer receive services under the asylum application law when they start a study.
The latter does not receive a bafög because they do not fall under the circle of the authorized persons.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to Bafög, this span is reduced to 15 months from 1 January 2016.
However, this financial gap also needs to be closed, which requires Steffen Krach, Berlin’s Secretary of State for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play an important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively exercise the same rights as it has the churches, and further develop the existing state church law to a new state religion ratio.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that professionally cares for the newcomers.
The rights also include obligations.
For this reason, Islam’s representatives must be able to work together with the state in many areas and arrange for certain control options.
This includes the willingness to take care of religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the president of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to express such conflicts in Germany “have their right to go here, in Germany, to work here,” he said in the Bavarian broadcast.
He proposed to translate the basic law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more than today a subject of the whole society.
As a result, the majority society will also have to change, the decline of discrimination and racism will be more pressing.
Germany, as a result of European decisions, has been an anti-discriminatory agency and a general law of equality for almost a decade.
But it learns very slowly how the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: what migrants organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long been demanding and to which international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention of Germany are committed must become reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and use its new citizens to the good of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical medical care to the previously expected refugees, according to Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
“As far as Man power and capacity are concerned, we create it,” he said.
However, additional money had to be flown into the system.
In order to avoid traffic jams, Montgomery demands that all applicants be delivered immediately when registering health cards.
The services provided could later be calculated with the Federal States.
In the long run, it is highly questionable to have so many people with the limited performance catalogue that the asylum application law provides.
Otherwise, the doctors are mainly going to create language barriers.
Even so, according to Berlin health scientist Thea Borde, migrants are getting worse over their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in doctoral practices, should interpreter costs be taken, she demands.
However, many refugees would also be helped with more general medical approaches in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic view.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned with HIV education.
However, with some of the other medical images, German doctors got clear from their training, Montgomery says.
\"Parasitism or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize - and with regard to the lack of doctors, the refugees may even see relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, and many refugees were even doctors.
In order to be able to practice, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and, if possible, review again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates from the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from post-trumatic stress disorder or depression.
Especially vulnerable are refugee children, said Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study by TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is being traumatized in Germany.
Those who are suffering from post-trumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with respiratory distress, sulfur, heart rate and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong fear and emotional deafness.
To prevent symptoms from being chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz said.
So far, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers in the social offices may be able to apply for psychotherapy, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, most professionals or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether or not a therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misunderstandings, says Munz.
Many invite to dream
With the new stage “Leidenschaft” the Circus Revue attacks on the traditions of circular art.
The goal is to attract every age group in the banners of fascinating acrobatics, animal dresses and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Vue invites to the mange on the brick wash for dreaming.
“Our passion is the circle.
“I can’t imagine living without my circular family,” says Stephanie Auer, animal teacher and junior chief.
‘Leeding’ - under this motto is the current man-made scene.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family Revue.
The gift of enthusiasm is, therefore, in the blood of the family.
“It’s important for us to get people away from their everyday waste and take them to a completely different world for two hours,” the 27-year-old junior chief executive said.
\"Manegencocktail with world-city flair - so director Reinhard Revue calls his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3,000-mile-long tour can now experience this flair.
The circulation’s program convinces with talented artists from around the world.
Excellent at the international circulation festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with jokes and charms in their banners.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their crafts.
With the heroes of the silent films, it wants to keep the Cuban duo loose.
Easyness and mobility - in these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the mast is to conquer women’s hearts in the storm.
Apart from numerous laughter ointments, the acrobatics of the Circus Accord also fascinate with finger tip feeling and jointness.
Balancing the wheel on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Serpents fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinates with its mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
“The animals belong to our family,” says Stephanie’s mother, Brigitte.
Mistakes in the attitude of circular animals are only too often the subject of various animal protection organizations.
Stephanie Vue also points out: “If our animals are not good, we are not good either.
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stroke unit.
The “four-legged artists” as they are lovingly called, will be read from the eyes if possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel comfortable, it doesn't want to be in the mange either.
The top commandment: make good care for the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhength and a Zebrasthute, the family background is proud.
The two animals lived together for eight years and nothing happened.
“But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there,” Brigitte says.
The zebroid is not yet ready for the mange, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Accord.
So, for every visitor, something might be there.
“One thing is certain,” says Stephanie Auer: “No matter whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and are with all our heart.
The Circus Accord invites its ideas every day from 17 to 20 September.
On Sunday, the program will begin at 11 a.m. and 16 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the idea at 17:00 the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open every day from 10 am to 18 pm.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe gives a false speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell from a podium down the stairs at the beginning of the year.
He remained undefeated, but the case's video spread quickly through social media.
The opening of Parliament was also driven by allegations of opposition by MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and that they had been warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's address with bully calls.
Last month they had outgrown him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesperson for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones, which they warned against disrupting Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
“The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title ‘Death’,” he said, according to Mugabe’s speech.
It warns the Member of Parliament concerned that immunity in Parliament will end, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was \"carried about\" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings efforts of the company’s services.
HP will split into two partner-notated companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its faster-growing business terminal and its service business activities.
The expected job loss leads to a charge of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies in transitioning to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better established than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion of annual revenue and will be focused on providing previously unsolicited, integrated technology solutions for companies - such a statement from the company.
It splits a company founded by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s to produce electric plants and whose Palo Alto Garage has been called the birthplace of the Silicon Valley.
HP has gone through massive interference to cope with the decline of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP’s measure, the world’s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in this field, based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger emphasized to Wilshere that it is not until September and if his return is due to plan, there is no reason why he can’t play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England, and given his history, his participation in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain next summer.
The great shame with this current problem is that Wilshere had strongly ended the last season after a separate knee injury and then recovered to his old swing during the previous season.
“This kind of injury does not threaten the career,” Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
This is not a bigger matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his knees or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated danger of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different diseases from Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five games.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs in six out of eight games since 2007/08, which have the most days of injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
“Sometimes when you get back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time in which you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident he will do it and he will run a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on the upcoming Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta may start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and the players who need to have a small break-up,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to get on through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the biggest deterrent effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after the “unbeatable” campaign started last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the teaching from the previous season with the Champions League surrender against Monaco and remains driven by the far hope of leading the club to its first European Cup.
“This drive is immense,” Wenger said.
It never happened to Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar portrayals in shows is obvious, especially with regard to the need for men to open up, now even more desperate than ever, as suicides among young men at a 15-year-old high prove.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM campaign against a painful life) announced 2015 as the man’s year, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the centerpiece in the struggle to master this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school patients with depressed symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with “healthy mood,” his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you first have to have friends so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its focus on style on substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, life-sustaining and successful, even though in reality the isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call eccentric values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health much more deeply.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money can’t really buy luck.
The beautiful thing about friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was defined, not by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent embraces, moments of football-watching in cozy chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all of this came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it, even if they often hold back, fully exploring their feelings.
“My role in listening to people who feel depressed and are suicide-threatening has shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference.”
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old use of speech “I come to terms with it” has a huge effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you talk about problems openly.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the culture completely redesigned to celebrate the day, why not take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
When Mary meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his encounter with Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass by Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held the course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Prince's Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of her Champions League debut as a PSG player, who led the French champion on the way, but then they missed a number of occasions before finally raising their lead when Cavani reached a headball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master, as they not only strive for the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement along the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while she got the points, it was not a class game by Laurent Blancs Team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities ahead of the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League, so it’s a good start to win 2:0, cause our opponents problems, and relax back even if there are certain things we still have to perfect throughout the season,” Blanc said.
“This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn’t reach one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which on the weekend was able to hold a 2:2 draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was kicked out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing tower was referred to as the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he pointed out why, when he left in Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense, he ended up with Johan Wiland in the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the midfield raised a heavy opponent.
But except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who was far past Kevin Trapps Pfosten in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some missteps and bad conclusions, not least by Ibrahimovic, who, in no less than five attempts alone, was put in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani put it on after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic, who turned Di Maria into a screenplay, which was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the Pfosten...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, and the Uruguayan achieved his sixth season goal after Ibrahimovic fished a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could get back into the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi was averted a goal in the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: “Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The skills games are not enough.
Have a hat in front of Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The mining giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, which is affected by outstanding raw materials prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt relief plan.
The London registered company Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling raw material prices, as China’s economic decline is pushing demand and devastatingly affecting markets.
The issue of reference rights brought Glencore’s share price to the trade on early Wednesday morning a rapid increase to the top of the London Stock Exchange.
The stock rose by 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69% higher.
Glencore had announced the $2.5 billion stock sales last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to charge around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares to 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the final course on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns regarding long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other raw materials prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long escape.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The latest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xis' first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and will be returning President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders have conducted bilateral talks.
\"President Xis visit will offer the opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation in a series of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, but also give President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to approach areas of disagreements constructively,\" the statement added.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington in Seattle before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
It is expected that Obama and Xi will address a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns regarding alleged cyberspionage of China and its growing self-awareness in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
440-PS sports car borrowed and driven to scrap
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrow a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway then came the evil awakening.
At a company in Gotha County you can fulfill the dream and once borrow and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
So did a 29-year-old from Gotha County.
On the A 71 at Arnstadt the dream was then out and over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, drove on wet track to the Schleudern and drove into the lead plank.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who then played for FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times Cup winners, four times Champions League winners, two times Club World champions, two times European champions, one time World Champions - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In summer the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now betrays that he was already standing before the 2008 EM before the graduation from Barcelona.
“You told me that Barça wants to sell me.”
“Madrid won everything at the time, we didn’t tell anything,” he said.
And that also registered the FC Bayern.
Xavi: \"There was an offer from Bavaria -
\"Forty Years Wanted to Have Me\"
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi did not change
But the change did not happen.
And the decisive man for this is working today for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: “Barça has taken Guardiola under contract and I have played a great EM”
\"Pep told me that I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me.\"
\"That's why he got me.\"
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 game season would have run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the Champions League quarter-final against the Bayers all over the distance on the lawn, turned off the red (4:0, 1:1) and at the end celebrated the King-Class triumph.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in film creation
Matt Damon confronted African American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity and said she will not need behind the scenes.
During a follow-up to Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when he emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the project's selected screenplay.
“When we talk about diversity, you do it when the film is occupied and not when the show is occupied,” Damon assured.
Brown responded shockingly, with insulting incredulousness, and called “Hoo! Wow. Okay” when the actor’s comments of The Martian got stuck.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
“I want to encourage people to think about it — whoever will ever be the director — as they treat the figure of the Harmony,” Brown said.
The only black person, and she is a nut that is beaten by her white waitress.
Dear White People’s producer set himself up for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for directing rights to the film; Damon replied that their direction “in the end could give us something we don’t want.”
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disapproval about Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing “Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that’s SO WEISS that it hurts.”
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the top of social discussion.
After the teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved nationwide effect and forced legislators and authorities to discriminatory practices against colourful compliance.
In February, the singer Prince made a play on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
\"Album's silent matter - (Album still has its meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
In recent years, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have released a statement in response to the question of Fox news personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,” the leaders said.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogules invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' Wins First Champion
Professional athletes and operating assistant Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the grand prize of $1 million.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competitive participant who was able to complete all the stages of his slavery course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten managed to go to the final.
The last task involved climbing on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the struggling phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished this challenge three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard-fighting victory, still under the shock of winning the Great Prize of $1 million.
“I mean, it’s amazing to think about it, I’ve never earned more than $10,000 or had to live — Isaac E! said about his bunch of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how that is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer, Kent Weed, joined The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why British, even though he was the first to finish the race, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
“If there are more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time,” Weed said.
How much the money is a wonderful prize and life changes, it gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's going to have any groll about it.
He is just so happy to have done what he did.
He received many awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, \"If I should be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac.\"
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had confused the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, the rotation will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers drag over to Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS- The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Previously they were once one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers were reduced to their role as spoilers, but on Tuesday they played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins lost a chance to climb within a half-game of Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard pitch.
For Detroit, though only for an evening, it was a return of the three letter F-words, which was so hard to grasp over much of the second half of the season.
“All wins are fun, no matter what happens,” said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) struck up 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine matches.
“I want to end this year,” Simon said.
It’s hard to throw every game in the bullpen, so I want to go into the game very focused.
The designed Tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
“He had a good blow on the wood,” said Ausmus.
He looked good at (schlagtraining), looked much better at the bullpen, and he brought it directly into play.
With three runs in the afternoon at the end of the seventh innings, the Twins had their best chance of returning to play.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bunt, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived wall, the only man with whom he was confronted, in front of the designed rookie drummer Miguel Sano, who went to the right-hander Drew Verhagen a two-run.
With a pair of runners and the finish round in the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League that Plouffe hit a double play.
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Wall created an RBI double against the locker of Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the level of 5-4.
However, the right-hander challenged Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of the game to catch up with a not yet moving Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-hand veteran, who had been beaten by the injured list before the game after he had failed for more than a month due to a back lead.
“Of course not the beginning I wanted,” Hughes said, “but I felt better when I got off and felt that I was going to create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning.”
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez to the game, who created a single \"up the middle\" in the first round of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers added in second, reaching a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center-fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
“That was a big blow,” said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn’t hit very well, but he caught the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch count, did not reach points in the third inning before being replaced by the right-hander A.J.Auchter.
At Hughes, there were three runs in six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
MEMORIAL: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez kicked out due to an injury of the throwing shoulders.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injured list due to a shoulder distortion, is scheduled to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is beaten by the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers, since being purchased in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been missing since August 20 due to a breakdown in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people in need should then be accommodated in the bathrooms in the area, as the city of Wiesbaden reported on Tuesday evening.
She calculated with 450 to 750 arrivals.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily be accommodated there.
They should then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the Government Bureau responsible for the initial capture, 7500 people had arrived in  hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also established emergency accommodations in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be a possibility.
“I believe that the decision-making of military action options should not take place without Germany,” he said.
He accused the European states of \"collective way-viewing\".
Four years ago we were happy that the keelch of military involvement in Germany had passed.
“Now the conflict is falling in front of our door,” he said in Germany’s radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on site for refugees.
Austria controlled on southern and eastern borders
According to Germany, Austria has also introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Vierner said on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF, no one will be returned to Hungary.
Germany also did not send refugees back to Austria.
“No, that’s what she said,” she said.
For the question of an agreement after which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Vierner said there have already been conversations between the Director-General for Public Safety and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete numbers and referred to conversations on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany began temporary border controls on Sunday.
EU states have not yet been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
EU ministers want to take a new approach to binding distribution of more than 120,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday (September 22).
In view of the strong refugee rank in Germany, the federal government wants to be more supportive of countries in the first collection and distribution of people.
The alliance will manage this together with the countries, announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after nearly four hours of consultation with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor’s Office in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those who need protection also receive it.
However, those who do not have a remaining perspective cannot stay in Germany either.
This opinion has been explicitly shared in the round.
The chancellor emphasized that the state as a whole now has to cope with a “rich effort”.
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-mile-long border with Serbia on Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that the border in Romania would also close with a fence.
This neighboring country belongs to the EU unlike Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent Schlepper from seeking alternate routes across Romania, Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said to the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had crossed the fence.
Thousands of other migrants were on the way to the Greek border, according to eyewitness reports in Turkey.
Space probe - Cassini - finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the ice tank of Saturn's Enceladus moon, a global ocean fluctuates.
Close researchers from observations of the space probe \"Cassini\"
Then the moon easily dangles around the ring planets on its path.
Although this Taumel movement is only small, yet too large for a continuous solid celestial body, it is said in a communication from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal Icarus.
For a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
As of 2006, “Cassini” had already discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn’s moon, which spewed water vapor and ice particles and thus fed Saturn’s so-called e-ring.
At least in the South Pole there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at the time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama is missing in 1860 Munich for several weeks
The 1860 Munich must refrain from offensive actor Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation resulted in an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association announced.
Rama had already complained about pain early in the week.
According to Münchner Lionen, the diagnosis means \"presumably four weeks of forced break\"
“It’s hard to believe Rama is a loss.
“Of course, we need to think now,” said sports director Necat Aygün of the “picture” newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a united professional.
However, as a training guest, the Sixziger first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croat currently has “the opportunity to prove his ability”
Tor hunter Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his brain shake.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is scheduled to enter the training course.
Okotie had been injured in the match at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent collapsing on the head.
In contrast to first fears, he remained without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy sweet.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his lean line, it is often more likely to be removed from them.
Because mangos contain relatively a lot of sugar - especially Saccharosis.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: B-Vitamin and the vitamins E and C. In particular, however, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta-carotin.
Those who eat the fruit thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell.
The shell color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet foods.
However, a mango also gives hearty dishes a special note.
It milds the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicoree and radicio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
The U.S. U.S. Patrol Service UPS is resuming up to 95000 aid for the Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
Drivers are mainly sought.
As early as last year, UPS had raised its workforce for the holiday season by 95000 assists.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making preparations for Christmas business since past year.
In 2013, late deliveries brought harsh criticism to the package services.
First Föhsturm, then marked cold front
The next night, in the valleys of the Alpennord side of the Föhn, it breaks through, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and on the night to Thursday, the fencing partially blows with stormy strength through the fencing valleys.
After dawn on Thursday morning, we cross a marked cold front that brings powerful rainfall, wind forests and a temperature decline.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area across the British Isles in a strong south-west stream.
On the Alpine side, on the night of the Wednesday of the fencing, the valleys break.
As a result, the fir blows into the fir valleys from 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in Urnerland, with over 100 km/h.
The furry can, in a way, advance to the adjacent Mediterranean, and even hurricane trees of over 120 km/h are possible on the mountains.
While in the north on Wednesday’s stormy hair provides summer temperatures of from 23 to 27 degrees, the moisture on the Alpine suspension begins to stagger.
Here is rain that lasts until Thursday night.
In total, south of the Alps must be calculated in the next 48 hours with partly over 100 liters of rain per square meter, this after large amounts of rain have fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning the Föhn goes out the air, as a result, a cold front with strong, partially wet rains from West to East rolls over Switzerland.
Along with the cold front, the wind is strong until stormy, and the temperatures are significantly reduced.
The following days will present themselves in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, on the south, on the weekend it will be more sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, a so-called place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on Wednesday in the name of the German reformer.
At the \"Piazza Martin Lutero\" he is now regarded as the \"German theologian of the Reformation\".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome just next to the Colosseum.
The naming was requested by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the Popes over centuries as a minority could often only live in hiding their faith.
With the square, it becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) held up as a young Augustinen monk about the turn of the year 1510/11 in Rome for a few months.
He then saw the city as a perfect symbol of sin.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him in the view of historians in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then launched the division of the Evening Church with his theses against the surrender trade.
Hammer Artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Old painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
At first, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpretations of Biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His \"speak\" with colorful colors and fantastic shapes has been given to the 75-year-old - which, however, is by no means the same with \"loving\" images.
On the other hand, adapted to the respective topics, this can be quite dark.
For about three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many subjects of the \"book of all books\".
Its origins are cycles that devote themselves to topics such as crossroads, plagues, commandments, or father-in-law.
As a result, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to Luther's publisher with his theological orientation as well as to Kettler's publisher with his focus on art books.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Altepost, who, on the basis of the painting, has contended with the respective Bible sites.
He has interpreted the Bible sites selected by Otmar Alt and has translated them into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's painting.
They are embedded between Martin Luther’s original Bible quote and a set of artists who here form his very personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry tape has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately all the triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrhuter order.
“The education had already happened with the pipe stock,” Otmar Alt recalls.
“I have tried to work on this in order to perhaps be able to deal with the Lord’s Father again.”
His second concern is to restore art to more priority in a fast-paced time: “The perception of visual worlds today is marked by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolics are being pushed there.
Artists have a different desire and desire to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
“In this respect, I am a dinosaur.
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to “fall into the pictures, let them act on themselves, discover and feel what force they have: “The image is looking for its opposite.”
Klaus Altepost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Old Bible in the Otmar Alt Foundation, \"always - a lover of Otmar Alt's art: \"I like how he perceives life with his pictures\"
Alt did not consider taking the Bible completely, but chose the key issues that were important to him, including mysterious topics.
“This was not an eye-high collaboration,” says Altepost: “This is about the pictures, the text simply explains, created a picture Bible.
For Hans Möhler of Luther Publishing, this work is an invitation to deepen his life and find freedom.
Otmar Alt's images speak for millers both the (biblical) language of love and those of responsibility.
Part of the original - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, which will be opened on November 15 in the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX train close
Plans were made, space was found, companies were assigned, earthenware hill modelled for a round course: A year later almost everything was finished - but even before the official opening of the BMX train was completed.
Failures in politics and administration caused confusion, especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the train.
So Hills disembarked, sought new space - now with formal planning and application for construction permit.
In October, the First Municipal Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now informed in the Children's and Youth Committee.
“I hope that this year is still visible,” she said.
It will then begin working at the former hall pool without a further break of remembrance.
DFB strengthens engagement for refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees by 2019, the Bundesliga setting a clear sign on weekends.
Football responds to Germany’s top-point situation and secures its help in dealing with the upcoming problems.
“I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the reunification,” he said.
“There can be no one to say in principle, I don’t have anything to do with it.”
“It must be of interest to each individual to get this topic under control,” said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
“I am in the chancellor’s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Özoğuz and the Chancellor there.
“The issue will certainly play a central role,” he announced.
Football can and will help.
However, the decisive weeks must set the policy.
The German Football League has therefore expanded its refugee initiative —1:0 for a welcome — by four years.
“About the Egidius Braun Foundation we have guaranteed that this programme will continue until 2019,” Niersbach said at the edge of the UEFA conference in St. Julian’s/Malta.
Some federal ligists also support this program.
Already on this weekend, the 36 professional clubs will have a clear sign when they will be wearing on the left jersey instead of the otherwise common sponsor logo (Hermes) “We will help - #refugeeswelcome”.
“We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only,” said Leverkusen’s sports chief Rudi Völler of the “Picture” newspaper (Service Day) and described the project as “of course”
“The refugee drama is about everyone, no one can see away.”
“We football nationalists can, no, we need to take advantage of our power, influence, and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly,” said Michael Preetz, Hertha’s manager.
Hoffenheim CEO Peter Rettig spoke of a “prominent sign of the League”
For the EM qualification game against Hungary this Friday, the women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach referred to the support of refugees as \"a large community of German football\"
The fact that all 36 licensors in their locations had started their own projects is great.
It is just as great that small and small clubs are active there.
The message -1:0 for a welcome - which we have issued is living in football.
“That’s very important,” he said.
In this and the following year, the Association, together with the DFB election and the Federal Government, will provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees.
“The clubs have already released the whole sum for 2015 as well,” Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in accident
The CEO of Europe’s largest software group, Bill McDermott, has lost the left eye, according to several reports, due to a crash in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother’s home in the United States, he fell on a glass of water after midnight, which he carried in the left hand, the “Agricultural Week” reported on Wednesday.
“He was almost closed, was powerless, then dragged himself out of the street - which he told us last week - citing the “WiWo” SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott can do his job.
“At the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf,” Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager will be at the meeting and will be “full of work” -
McDermott announced in an interview with the South German newspaper (Thursday edition), he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
“I’m full of SAP, full of my job.
“Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board all the time, and its chairman Hasso Plattner,” said McDermott of the SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the United States, but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP center in Walldorf.
It is important to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the SZ said, “Anybody can do that.”
\"It's important to get up again when you've fallen down.\"
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen except for fighting ...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he crashed from the wheel.
He is therefore not as much a reserve driver for the two tribal pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the weekend in Singapore, as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfelder im Tor
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have been finally shattered.
The national player will also be missing from the table leader of the football national league in duell with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 p.m./Sky).
“We can’t go back to him,” Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen, the BVB coach said: “We expect him to return to training on Friday.
Given the high load of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his stem self at the Giant position.
So he announced a change in the tortoise position.
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
\"He trained at an absolute top level - the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether weid fields will be used in all European League matches in the future, however, Tuchel left open.
He will likely also contest the second match.
The research statement by co-player Reus that the final draw for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, explains midfielder Julian Weigl: “It’s not as wrong as Marco is.”
“I think we have a good chance to access the title.”
Robot Cars: Government wants to lead role for Germany
Germany is expected to be, according to the Federal Government's will, in the change of the car's technological precursor.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA car fair about a \"new mobility age\"
The automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and make it less dusty, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA.
The Department of Transport’s strategy paper emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid shift to digital listening radio.
In order to test new technology, a test section is currently being created on Highway 9 in Bavaria.
In order for the driver to be given no additional liability risks, the Federal Government wants to review the legal frameworks and, where necessary, to adapt them to the new developments.
For example, Germany wants to use itself internationally to increase the allowed maximum speed for self-caring cars from 10 to 130 miles.
The Federal Government is also committed to a change to the Vienna Convention, which is so far only for the people as a driver.
In the case of automated driving, the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more the passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that collect the environment and process the data in seconds.
After a study submitted by the Ministry of Economics, highly automated driving on highways will be technically possible by 2020.
Despite this, driverless vehicles on public roads are expected to be in the first place after 2020.
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany are estimated by the authors of the study for 2025 to be around €8.4 billion.
“The vehicle’s digital network can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic,” said SPD transport politician Soren Bartol.
However, the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the driver's personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, the German self-caring cars still see skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey submitted on Wednesday at the AA by Forsa Institute on behalf of the Dekra audit organization shows that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will continue in the next ten years, 32 percent only expect to believe 31 percent at all in 20 years.
In France, 21 percent of those surveyed expect autonomous cars, 33% in the United States by 2025.
In any case, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely fully on a self-promoting vehicle.
After a survey of the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to issue control throughout the trip on all roads.
On the highway, at least 15 percent could be imagined in the flowing traffic, at 45 percent.
Almost every fourth would not leave control to the car under any circumstances.
Boll says team and double start at table tennis-EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to save only in individual terms in the title fights from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision is to fall by 22 September at the latest.
“This is a huge loss for our team.
“The boys learned it in the morning.”
“But we’re strong enough to get the title even without Timo,” said Federal coach Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
At this time, Boll was on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsoring date in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
“Without Timo is the disadvantage, we’re no longer such a clear favorite now,” said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the set list in Yekaterinburg, also remembered the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
“At that time Timo also failed, and we became European champions,” he said.
“We should focus on that,” said the world rankings-five.
English football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has committed a serious injury on the right leg.
In the Champions League match at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis, in the 20-year-old player of Bastian Schweinsteiger, pointed to a rail break.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible
It is a mix of very large fashion show and a wax figures group cabinet: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: Show window dolls, which look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and thus he put men in skirts.
“I can’t say today that I’m the Enfant’s terrible of Haute Couture because I have white hair.”
“It used to be turned out, it’s real,” Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition “From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk”, which can be seen from September 18 in the Art Hall of the Hypo-Cultural Foundation, it is fortunate that the fashion creator changed his initial rejection attitude to a look at his person.
In fact, he had been against it because, “I heard an exhibition a little after death,” he said.
When you die, you get to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
“It’s about so much more than just beautiful clothes,” said the director of the Art Hall, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits provide an insight into the man’s hardly-to-be-surpassed work that has written fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is an excellent choreographed overall artwork for which much effort has been made: To freeze the dolls, for example, a stylist has been dedicated.
14 tons of material has been transported to Munich by the creator Thierry-Maxime Loriot.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was another special smack: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women — women are smarter than men — and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer's first, visible fashionable walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he attracted his teddy bras and clothes, Gaultier said.
To play with a doll, his parents would not have allowed him to play.
The design of fashion was later taught itself.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, I bought it, of course.
For his first own fashion show, he couldn’t pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clamoths.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener Spitze as fashion niche
Previously, it went into the long stickers and around plumbing around making meters.
The stuck fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers who continued to process them, for example, to cover and curtains.
This alone does not work today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of the fashion peak Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener peak, Mode played a larger role, then was pushed by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as niche.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: top in jewelry, at accessories such as bags and at regional moves.
At all times, the so-called vintage fashion, which lends itself to past style poaches, depicts an increasing potential for order.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all the orders.
In addition to nine other companies, Modespitze Plauen is a member of the Plauener Spitze and Stickerreien industry association.
Only they can wear the protected label.
Over the last 15 years, about 80 percent of the revenue has been lost.
Private business and wholesale are almost non-existent.
Our products hardly reach customers in this way.
Today, mass goods are being manufactured in the Asian area a lot cheaper and almost exclusively distributed via chains.
Exports are also weak, currently moving to Russia and the United States.
Enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score by environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer explains by the stickperle in Falkenstein: “Since this year we have carried out a quality seal, which shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible.”
Reinhardt adds: \"This also refers to the materials used -
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger extraterrestrial office of the West Saxon Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and specializes in embroideries and tips.
In order to counter competition from the Asian area, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
It creates a field of tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think mainly economically, says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only easily varied to keep a customer base.
Some years ago, textile designer Kati Reuters revived the historical snowball peak.
In this case, the machine sticks small cuddles in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Kraße was inspired by this: “I had never started with traditional Plauener Spitze before,” he said.
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it characterizes the pattern in silver.
“Many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old,” says Reuters.
It also supplies in the United States, to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and who want a memory piece.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador to the Plauene peak.
Disney plants new -Mary Poppins -Film
Legends should not be touched, but Disney still dares a new film of his classic Mary Poppins.
However, according to Entertainment Weekly, it is not a refilming, but a kind of continuation that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical girl.
It is about the experiences of Nanny with the Banks family in times of world economic crisis in England.
Those who play poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already standing: Rob Marshall, last with \"Into the Woods\" in cinema.
Xi urges the economy to open wider for the world
The economy needs to open up further outwards in order to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday a group that was tasked with steering the reform.
“China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business foundation strategies,” he said in a statement at the 16th meeting of the Central leadership group for deepening a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new foundations and moving forward reforms will lead to new vibration and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a number of policies, including a negative list of market access regulations, the relaxation of border control policies, the promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital, and the acquisition of the population waste system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is constantly tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important as it assigns a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources, guarantees a legal environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also shut down controls over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how they manage their businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas of private investment will be opened.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-financed companies and provide better services for them,” the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card, which will facilitate the requirements and facilitate the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their activities and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also filed at a meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also participated in the meeting, as was reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury border value in predators
The European Commission wants to double the thresholds for mercury in large predators and thus provide consumers with a significantly higher dose of nerve poison.
The Foodwatch consumer organization, which has an appropriate work paper from the EU, criticized the plans harshly: “Risics and side effects of missed industrial and environmental policies are being passed on with full weight to pregnant and small children,” said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish for economic reasons, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
Large predators, however, are already so heavily burdened with mercury that on the basis of the remaining limit values, about 50 percent of the catch may not be sold.
After double the limit values, only 14.5% would be unsales.
In return for this lockdown, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to sharpen the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
However, Foodwatch referred to this as “trick” because smaller peacekeeping fish, such as carpentry, are usually so low that they already meet the planned maximum values today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore “a perfide distraction maneuver that helps the economy alone,” Wolfschmidt said.
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which greatly enriches themselves over the food chain, especially in predators.
The Federal Government therefore warns that “ready to cause small amounts especially in the event of unborn damage to the nervous system.”
The Federal Ministry of Environment, however, declares on its homepage that a “health risk to the general population” is not to be expected.
mercury is mainly due to coal combustion into the environment.
According to a written statement from the Federal Ministry of Environment, German coal power plants to the Green Country Day Deputies, Annalena Baerbock issued more than six tons of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fishes, for example in Elbe, Rhein and Danube, has been \"permanently and coverstly exceeded - had the mirror quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe’s wide warnings about mercury in fish have already been among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
