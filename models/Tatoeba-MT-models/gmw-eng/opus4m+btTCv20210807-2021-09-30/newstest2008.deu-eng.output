Food debt to European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation measured in the eurozone is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the eurozone, the cost was higher than expected in November - after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, according to the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official predictions have gone from only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
In contrast to the American, British, and Canadian bank of note, the European Central Bank (EZB) has not lowered the sense of leadership. According to your opinion, the reduction in interest rates would favour the increase in raw material prices and the slight decline in unemployment the emergence of an inflation spiral.
The ECB is committed to keeping the inflation rate below two percent, or at least barely at the two-percent market.
According to one analyst, the bodies are in the wickmill: one must “deal” the inflation to exclude later action needs.
With 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in Germany reached a 12-year record high in November; in Spain, the rate rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
It is responsible for increasing inflation in the eurozone that the increased food and energy prices are.
The MATIF wheat notes rose by 88 percent, and the course for Soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
Food oil and milk products also had a significant cost in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly US$100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but it is expected to decrease to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts are going out of a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
the Gallup Government Crisis
After long stagnating, the number of Fidesz sympathisers has increased significantly by the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has had the largest base camp, while the approval for the socialists according to Gallup has reached a low point of 13 percent that has never been reached.
In the case of the party-faithful voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition advocates: More than two-thirds (71 percent) are facing a fifth (20 percent) approval for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary entry threshold: they come in the total population to two percent.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
In contrast to the latter, the overall economic mood has continued to deteriorate - never before has the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be \"promisingly bad\" so high (41 percent) while further 46 percent consider it \"very bad\".
After more hopeful views in the spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation more pessimistically.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth of the population is affected.
A Gallup survey conducted in December revealed that 71% of respondents — a historical high — considered the prime minister’s work “presumably bad as right.”
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the proportion of advocates for Viktor Orbán accounts for 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of Fidesz’s party chief.
One of the indicators of political mood is the number of those who think that one could get the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister even without change of government.
After the riots in last October, 35% had spoken out for the stay of the government and the chief of government, this share today is only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) see the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the People’s Vote, 60 percent replied that they would “partisan” and give off another 20% of their vote, probably.
For comparison, if parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55 percent — with security — would go to the urine, further 15% would hold their participation for “probably” in view of these trends, the result of the popular vote would be bleak.
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital daily money.
Converted to the group of people who participated in the People’s Agreement, the shares of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would be 81, 84, or 89 percent.
Also the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth.
The hypermarkets in the Buddhist trading area have also maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Buddhist trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of Napi has also increased by 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets, price increases have been recorded by over 1,000 HUF.
After prices in the food markets have been “adjusted” in the past December, the cost of food has not fell dramatically, compared to the previously high, previous level of output.
However, it certainly does affect consumers appallingly that for which they paid far below 9,000 HUF in the last year, this year is not even available for 10,000 HUF.
The price of the Napi cart exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the surveyed markets.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800, the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at a previous year’s level, but the prices for putenbrush fillets, nose and mouth have increased greatly.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of breadweeks for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price drop in the product to under 200 forints.
Also surprising was the price of a two litre of Coca-Cola Pand bottle of under 200 forints, thus the drink including Pand only cost 257 HUF.
However, this year in the \"Napi\" shopping carts-Compare Auchan is the most expensive, and Cora is the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased prices in the Napi shopping cart compared to the last year’s Christmas prices by 15, while Tesco and Auchan each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of the present year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of the last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1,480.00 HUF.
The average price increase was 1,206.00 forint in the previous year, but the increase in VAT in prices at last Christmas made it remarkable.
This is exactly what trade has done: the goods houses were apparently unable to decide exactly which price teams they should apply to the individual articles, since the impact of the price increase on consumer behavior was inescapable.
(If the dealer plans poorly the circulation rate of a product, it may fall for substantial profits in the price range that is aimed at traffic intensity.)
The cost of the Napi shopping cart in the past year fell dramatically, so that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forint, whereas the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket costed 1,630.00 forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest, there was a price increase of 1,284.00 forint.
Compared to the two last Christmas seasons, a disastrous price increase has been shown, the price of daily consumer items in the hypermarkets has increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: For some basic foods, the Statistical Office established a more than 30-percent cost in 12 months.
This is also the case in the case of eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the Napi shopping cart, this seems almost impossible, as the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has risen by little more than 10 percent in the worst case.
Clearly, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - however, they were able to cool the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is reported continuously by good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warehouses are no longer looking at prices.
It is bought from all large quantities, sustainable foods go into pallets over the store table.
Wednesday morning in the middle of the morning, there were endless snakes in all three warehouses when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multis complain to the opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned sales, not only in food, but also in sustainable consumer goods.
Many locations are saved from disinfectants
Today, more than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals, which were due to an improper treatment of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overburdening of staff - all factors that are not directly attributing to the incidence of infections, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, the disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumaatology department of János Hospital, a MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The bacteria resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection.
The victim of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with a MRSA infection. An important operation had not yet been performed since due to the bacteria still in the patient’s body.
By 10 December this year, multiresistant pathogens had reported infections to the National Nosocomialis Monitoring System from hospitals in 1094, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemic Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multiresistant pathogens have been safely registered in hospitals, but the dark number may be higher.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by the MRSA, which is resistant to methicillin-oxacillin staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carries about a third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as neck inflammation, constipation, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well-healed.
However, if the agents are dosed too high or used improperly, the well-responding bacteria produce antibiotics-resistant which spread rapidly in the hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in older, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the hospital everyday.
One could not confuse the infection with the epidemic, said Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA only doesn’t exist where it is not sought.
Resistance to antibiotics
“Such patients are isolated, the care staff wear rubber gloves and masks while providing, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
While the patients are being investigated for MRSA during their hospital delivery, infection cannot always be avoided.
Samples too rare
The majority of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the currently prevailing conditions and circumstances would be unfavourable for the prevention of the emergence or the spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and old-fashioned homes, the hospitals should examine the patients supplied and immediately isolate MRSA infected.
In the Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not practiced as often.
Not least because there are no grants for this investigation on the part of the state health insurance company.
Therefore, most cases come to light only when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
From the European Union's side, there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, that is, microbiological investigations are necessary so that no resistance to the drug can form, but this directive of hospitals is not always held.
Among the ambulances, or patients in the basic care, microbiological samples are even rarer, according to Karolina Böröcz.
In the case of disinfectants
Scientific evidence proves that MRSA is most often transferred from one patient to another by care personnel.
That is why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks, is of great importance, but there is also considerable weakness in the hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by drug infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient in the local hospitals.
The rooms are even often crowded, the beds are barely arranged together, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz continues to note, unfortunately, in the financially less well-formed hospitals, it occurs that in disinfectants, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that directly favor the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are taken, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections in contact causes health insurance huge costs, which is why they are fighting everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or their intervention in the government programme, was held.
According to first signs, the program is successful - as published data proves, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the emergence of multiresistant pathogens (including MRSA), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Death control police were not drunk
In the case of the car accident caused by the chief of police of the XXII district with a fatal outcome, the official report is now available.
The newly retired chief of police of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday in a car accident, was neither alcoholized nor under drug influence, Attila Morvai, the press spokesman of the Budapest Attorney-General said on Friday, after the official report was submitted.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before putting himself to the tax.
The former police chief bog with his own car in the XXII district entered Kossuth Lajos Street and crossed a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked spot.
(But, according to StVO, this is not a milder situation - the Lenker has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the Zebra Strip, after all.)
The pedestrian is causing his injuries after his delivery to the hospital.
According to police reports, the Lenker suffered a shock, then put his functions back and sought retirement.
The Budapest prosecutor has initiated their investigation into the incident.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former chief of police has been cooperating with the investigators from the beginning.
More EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three loan agreements in Budapest on Friday, totaling EUR 400 million.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) has approved a EUR 300 million in 2006 to finance transport and environmental projects, which are implemented with grants from the cohesion fund.
The sum agreed in the loan contract of EUR 150 million is also to be applied to the budgetary funding of educational projects.
A total of EUR 300 million has been approved for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later as part of the extension of the credit contract.
In the field of innovation, the Contracting Parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will be mainly flown in research and development programmes at Debrecen University.
At the meeting, the subway line 4 also came to the language.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary clarified the details of subway funding with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded a total of 113 projects in total of EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The credit interest rates are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is made available by the EIB at 8 years of age, without commission.
Bulgaria, the property-paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe is looking closely at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who is still buying the EU’s cheapest market, but who is getting more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is now undoubtedly the most desirable patch for real estate purchases in the Eastern European area, with favorable ski apartments and houses on the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, the Albena, the \"Gold Coast\" and the \"Sunny Coast\" and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar are the racers, but real estates around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly requested.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country sooner or later attracts investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the outstandingly favorable area of Russians.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - trading and office areas offer highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive European golfer paradises, and thus, in addition to the summer and winter season, attract tourists in the other two seasons.
Pre-sighted investors are already buying in a large style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria are also striving to change their life-changing lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested persons from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle buy either revitalized property by €50-100,000, or come down houses by €5-15,000, which they then renew themselves.
Good connections and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are written large, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category is those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group make up business people who invest with the goal of a medium- to long-term value increase.
Real estate in the capital is becoming increasingly expensive, as a result of the ever-growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but over the past five years, there has been a increase in prices by 21 percent annually.
The cost of real estate prices is far higher than the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the Six Hungarian percent
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries advise on the Bali timetable in which the emissions-reducing measures are set for the period following 2012, i.e. after the execution of the Kyoto Protocol.
At present, there is a fierce debate between industrial and developing countries.
The United States has already signaled that they do not want to negotiate on concrete numbers, but would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether industrial states are willing to support developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on the support of developing countries has also been reached.
The adjustment fund provided for by the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, expected to be read out at the UN Global Environmental Facility (GEF), as in the Piac és Profit.
Hungary's six percent
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, in the name of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection measures, and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister declared that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured by 1990 values), regardless of whether or not the “renewal after 2012” will be successful. The Union would be willing to make a 30-percent reduction, provided other major industrial states of the world, or developing countries are also willing to meet their obligations according to forces and responsibilities.
Gábor Fodor emphasized that the objective of the states that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU had already committed to 8% with its 15 member states at the time.
The requirement for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will fully meet as set out in the Environmental Ministry press release.
In this case, the long-term international climate policy agreement will not follow a new, international emission reduction system, the IPCC, the international Nobel Peace Prize-winning scientific climate change committee of the UN in its latest report.
As a result, emissions reduction would slow down, and the increase in Earth’s average temperature by more than 2° C. would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
The British Army is working on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
At first, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan have been loading videos of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The shots mounted on helmets are checked at the Kandahar Air Force terminal and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
Soldiers of the Air Force have already assisted 139 such recordings, their “channel” has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under “defence headquarters” in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (commonwealth Office) and the international peace forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force has released the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual goals of foreign deployments.
Such a kind of published propaganda is almost free of charge compared to traditional TV advertising, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message in themselves as they confirm the right of existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Advertise Americans with game
However, the army must also fight against amateur recordings, which also create a network in addition to carefully processed, censored footage, such as those showing the death of soldiers: in the somewhat more hypocritical, \"official\" propaganda films, the losses are most frequently discussed, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, numerous videos on the platform have already been loaded by the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British have only recently discovered them.
Americans, on the other hand, advertise something else, namely with the free downloadable shooting game “America’s Army” in which the player can slip into the soldier’s skin as part of a more or less life-sustaining simulation.
Christmas with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministries
Working Minister Mondika Lamperth is by no means immeasurable: Instead of a Christmas celebration, she conducts a working conference where her employees can finish the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some Ministries celebrate with live music, other charming Christmas vocals with Tombola or drives into the official hearts.
Party, Christmas Voice, Concerts and Buffet - so celebrates power.
Christmas fever has already taken over the offices as well.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held today in the defence resort, but it will not be expected by the staff of the ministry.
At the Waisen Christmas celebration, children are given by fallen soldiers, during the “Mission Celebration” family members are cared for by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other resorts, the National Agency for Development (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport beat the lines.
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economics will be held in the house of the future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a Tombola release.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) has held its 4.7 million forint expensive Christmas celebrations on Wednesday in the House of National Justice (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The hall rent was 1 million forint, the rest was issued for the more than 400 guests charged.
According to our information, a Department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas celebration, which is administered by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU countries.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater - Vígszínház - was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information as we have not reached the permissions.
What is the suit?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, who held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with an address from the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
On the request of [origo], it was announced: there was no ball dress or suit duty at the ball.
The Ministrys of Health, Work, and Self-Management prepare themselves for Puritan celebrations.
The Ministry of Health celebrates the celebration for employees in its own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Minister of Labor Mondika Lamperth officially does not invite its employees to a Christmas party, but to the annual conference.
It is estimated that about 180 guests, who, according to the press department, are only treated with coffee and pogats, will be celebrating with 350,000 forints.
Self-governing Minister Gordon Bajnai will simply be in charge with his colleagues in the Aula of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) celebrates a Christmas in its own feast hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenditures were measured with 2,500 forints per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent boosts.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the staff of the PM celebrate this manner every year.
However, there will be no right party vote - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration was set for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites January 20 to a new year’s reception, the Ministry’s Christmas celebration this time.
One hundred guests are asked to visit the castle Vajdahunyad in the city park Városliget; according to the location, the expenses are measured with 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception to which only accredited foreign diplomats are loaded in Hungary.
The receptions that are administered each year traditionally begin with a brief address from the minister and sound with a back-to-back noise.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Ministry of Education.
Asked about the cost of the Christmas celebration, it was not possible to provide information at the Department of the Environment’s press department.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is performed at the Art House Museum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
On Friday, the League Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation formed their coordination committee for the strike to begin on Monday.
On Saturday, a protest grand assembly will be held, on Monday - on the day of the People's Convention on the Health Insurance Act - the employment reduction will begin.
It is expected that strike-related significant traffic obstacles will occur, as railway traffic is almost completely stopped, and Budapest public transport companies (BKVs) will also strike up to 13:00.
Details of Monday’s strike are announced together on Friday afternoon by the League Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also established which is responsible for the coordination of the actions on Monday.
On Saturday a protest meeting will be held, and from Monday all organisations that have joined the strike will lower work for an indefinite period of time, provided that no agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike starting on the day of Parliament's vote on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the health insurance law, the trade unions immediately take the call for strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees will meet to consult on the further process.
Due to the National Council’s agenda on Monday, it is even possible that it will only be in the later hours of the evening, or even at midnight, to vote on the health insurance law.
The strike starting on Monday will require significant traffic barriers: the railways are laying down their work for an indefinite period of time, the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies are silent in the morning.
At the same time, there will be many local highwayblocks in a direction.
The call for the strike has followed numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the Liga website.
Some organizations have announced strikes on indefinite time, others are planning a temporary job reduction.
By Thursday afternoon, between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the railways VDSZSZ could not yet be achieved any agreement on sufficient services, although more and more people are on the train just around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, at the BKV from the start of operation to the 13 a.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy lay down the work for four hours, and the teacher's union, e.g., the Democratic Teacher's Union, have called for 2- and 2-8 hours of strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association reaches nationally changing times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Association of Health and Social Affairs Employees, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points requested by the League is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and submits a new conception for social discourse.
The second requirement relates to the step-by-step introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Call for number three is that the claimable professional groups will be allowed access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ belonging to the League of Trade Unions has not accepted the offer provided by the Ministry of Transport and is now demanding a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Department of Risk Analysis (Risk Analyzing Division) of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guards founded in this August, with the support of the “Moving for a Better Hungary,” raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
In the Institute's 'Construction Warning Report', it is said, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk represents the \"enhancement of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Zigeun population in Hungary, which could even lead to a short-term, violent ethnic conflict.
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is likely aimed at provocation of such a dispute, according to the Research Institute.
As reported, this is considered to be a failure by the political representatives: “People of public life have left the discussion of Roma-questions representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary gender.
It is suspected that this would reinforce the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent disputes.
The research institute also says that the activities of the Hungarian Guard had, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the pages of the domestic and foreign media, “the image of Hungary abroad has significantly damaged, in particular with regard to trust in stability and democratic maturity.”
We remember that since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extremely right-wing groups in Hungary has been on a continuous rise, so that since summer 2007, several “national self-defense” organizations have been formed.
“These groups mean that they define themselves as a civil organization, while openly bragging about preparing their members for defense tasks, including armed defenses, national defense, order protection, and the impunity of the police, the army, or the state itself.
And further, all of this happened in accordance with that method, which tried to tarnish various political and party-based aspirations of the population as a civil initiative.
Therefore, the emphasis of the civil character and form of association does not merely serve to reverse legal hurdles that could appear at court in the course of the registration - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard also represent a risk-enhancing factor for relations with neighboring states.
“In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighboring states, so some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighboring countries see in the creation of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region - it said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the founding of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose founding in August 2007 was announced by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the creation of the Bulgarian Guard, the Roma mass outpourings took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents immediately as an occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organisation is “national protection”.
In fact, in the last 17 years, a regular “Zigeunerterror” in Bulgaria has been felt, but the state has remained inexcusable and indifferent,” according to Political Capital.
And further, the initiative would have sparked a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also confirmed by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to establish their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guards have so far shown many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not to be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also, with organizing their own protections, will respond to the threats, according to the Political Capital’s risk warning report.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annually, risk analysis reports would be published, and should risk-changing trends be recognized, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the risk warning report being issued.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are legally regulated, so the practice of redisposing the working days around the holidays has now been established, but we are now subject to the coming year less such days.
In the EU and the United States, something else is also understood under the terms of State Day.
The Hungarian legal system differs between public holidays and work-free days.
Work-free days are usually church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are working-free days - the latter only so that the New Year’s delegates can rest.
We have fourteen holidays throughout the year.
The state holidays are March 15 that commemorate the 1848 Revolution, and October 23rd, the anniversary of the 1956 Revolution.
On 20 August, the foundation of the state will be celebrated on 1 May, on 1 and 2 November, we will commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each on Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall to a weekend, the practice of “workday shift” has proved itself in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on Saturdays, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finalised, the Minister of Labour has been set in its own regulation for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public employees and public service officials.
Only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on the holidays, are excluded.
Today, the order of work is only somewhat confused by the holidays at the end of the year: From December 24th, life here remains formal, since most of the days between Christmas and New Year’s, or take their own holiday.
The following year, more holidays will fall into the middle of the week, or to the end of the week, so that there will be less redispositions during the working days than this year.
The calendar will first be put on the head around the day of work so that people can stay at home for the same period of four days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a day of work so that Friday, May 2 may be a rest day.
The second redisposition is due to the holiday day on October 23rd: On Saturday, October 18th, you will have to complete Friday, October 24th.
The end of the year, however, will be restlessly in the sign of the holidays, after everything will be and will remain until 24 December, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six scary little ones to anger colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send out language messages we never receive - harmless lies that no longer come to our attention: they bring “colors” to everyday work.
The question is whether you are accustomed to these small inconveniences, or you are better at the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandings from being aware of other distressing situations.
Tipping.
“Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department,” says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
Best of all, you regret it and try to do it again, perhaps by calling at the marketing department and standing around, you would have forgotten to align the message (that's the less common method).
Most of the time, the case has been settled with an apology.
Before getting caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should consider how to really prepare unpleasant moments for your colleagues and try to deliberately avoid these situations.
Learn something that doesn’t belong to one’s own?
There’s hardly anything more nervous than when you access a document, office address, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Last night the lifter was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost ballwriter discovered on the desk of a colleague?
Without question, nothing should be borrowed from the colleagues, for they are rightly offended when they find that something has come away.
So, don’t put the bags or post-it out of the office in the bag, because it could happen to one of yourself: no one there anymore, if you need it urgently.
Talking about the private life of colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a trach that has already been put into the world.
Who made with whom?
Where and why?
You should not bind the information (or assumptions) about the private life of your colleagues, if possible, to each of them!
And if someone opens up and betrays us his inner secret, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to be silent like a grave, rather than the ones who are not currently present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
No reason to be ill reported?
If you call in the office to report ill when you call for a severe headache, because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, unsuspectable completions, projects with fixed appointments must now be done by colleagues rather than by yourself.
So don't play bad with my colleagues.
If you already know on the previous day that you won’t be able to do it in the office the next day, or that something could come in between, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the chief are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Tall, Kikcher, Phone
One is just deepened in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud gecko of the Pharisees?
Wouldn't a phone call be included that you shouldn't have heard?
One should not be able to sit down with sums, sings, loud conversations (which you lead across your heads), get trampled, keep squeezing or nagging.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not just deepened in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are they always the other fault?
If a project is not finished in time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important message, you should not seek the blame of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not be able to talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others have also been affected!
The question of how to recover the error, or how to recover the failed one, is just too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training pants and slipping: Comfortable for home, but has not lost anything in the office!
Not once should one dress so lower if it would actually allow the workplace!
Don't be too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress accordingly in the office - if desired, also nice and elegant!
Everyone wants to do it right - or how to get uninterested for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning.
A strange melody sounds out of the radio: the sound of a violin, coupled with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume higher.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song “Wings of Love” by Zagar, which sounds like mr2.
For a long time, the domestic music scene didn’t beautify us with a high-quality electropop.
But now you can even see the stuff differently when you hear Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene gradually contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock is back “in” with its guitar squirrel, the domestic electropop proves: There is new under the sun.
Baláz’s Zságer started playing in Pécs himself in the band Yonderboi before he - perhaps because a host house doesn’t tolerate two peppers - began his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which melts elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, only created it when asked to compose the soundtrack to a film, came to him (e.g.
\"Szezon - von Ferenc Török\".
The formation, which was initially performed in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the “wan2” magazine ran their first album in 2002 under the top 50 domestic albums, and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, cut the nearly only trendetter to be marketable in the West.
No doubt Zagar and his band were “trendy” but there was no interest in whether they would like to wear this brand as well.
The band has responded as it should: With a new, even better album.
The new album, entitled “Cannot Walk Fly Instead,” could open new ways for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The term originated from the time Baláz’s Zságer was still on his way with another band.
The airy, flying play would also be in order, but in addition to the essential character of music, the sounding guitar, the influence of the Rock'n'Roll, corresponding to the time-spirit and trends.
With these songs, the English-born singer György Ligeti has appeared at the premiere in Millenáris with the band “The Puzzle”.
A song from the album even made it to the radio hitter - which has since been broadcast from early to late pop music, mr2 Petőfi has recorded the listeners with the song \"Wings of Love - which was recorded under the influence of six domestic singers \"Underground Divas\", successively put the earword.
Everything is all right (?).
The hvg.hu asked Baláz's Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent does your music remain reserved for a certain layer?
Baláz’s Zságer: The term “shit music” doesn’t mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so, the so-called alternative or underground music can be visible and nothing-dealing, but it can also be produced only for the sale that makes it a commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The audience's willingness to receive the hearing also works in accordance with this principle, regardless of language and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience of your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers or twenties going on concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them, much more attentively because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many hear your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it's a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
For us, music does not come about for a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually felt in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but that is only in the unresponsive changes of the moment.
However, one thing I have noticed is that if you want to do it all right, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his way, let alone trying to interpret this into our music again and again.
We see ourselves as team players who rely on the other person’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi stands “Wings of Love” at first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was opening with a slightly more popular style in the direction of a wider audience deliberately staged?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which is then to be kept as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought to be the album's final, with which we wanted to resolve the soundorgy and the slightly more difficult issues.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why is it, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting together the choir from gifted soloists of the domestic music scene.
So the six-headed choir was created - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized later “Underground Divas”.
hvg.hu: Do you want to have the song the same way, or did it shape the girls?
B. Zs.: The song had been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material was finished for the album, we thought that this song was still \"something needed\"
The chord sequence has formally demanded a singing voice.
I still sang the melody on the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came practically to Anhieb and frighteningly spontaneous.
I can remember that I was quite electrified at the time, but it already needed the “divas”.
With my voice alone, the song would never become so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the plate and at the concert, however, you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (except for the short solo by Judy Jay), they don’t have their own role, sing perfectly together and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not just accompanied by music.
They were on stage as well.
Is it intent?
B.Z.: The fact that they were in the back was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to let them have solo roles.
In the number, it is also about forgetting his ego a little, forgetting who came from and where is going, let’s simply admit that these particular wings that elevate the wings of love.
I would have liked others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most expensive song?
B. Zs.: In the musical work of creation, there has been more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, at Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I played on a concert slave, or at \"Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls\" where the Groove didn't want to work for longer, but gradually everything came together like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes with the concerts constantly and even now where I have the album \"lost\".
There are currently “Prophet Is A Fool” and “Never The Same”
Deceived brokers risked billions of dollars due to feelings of inferiority
Unscrupulous frauds
Thus, his former employee Jerome Kervel refers to the French bank giant Société Générale, owner of the so-called Komerční banka.
It was worth almost five billion euros.
However, it seems rather so that Ker much was just a big player who wanted to do the same for his colleagues, and certainly was not capable of doing it.
In contrast to all major bank houses, he soon recognized the crisis at the American mortgage market.
“He is mentally weak,” was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who showed him to the police.
However, as the statements Kervels revealed, published by the French media, for example the daily Le Monde, he was a person who had achieved profits of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year with his business.
Crisis not just in America
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn just half a billion euros in the American crisis.
The opportunity to do so was at the beginning of the year.
In February, there had already been first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given low-income customers or those who had previously had payment problems, would be in trouble.
However, influence on the entire economy should not have this crisis.
Ker much didn’t believe that and kept right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profits to EUR 1.6 billion.
“I didn’t know how to explain this when I earned the first half billion,” she added, adding, “but he definitely didn’t keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he has faked documents so that they do not come to him.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though gradually the Eurex stock exchange was interested in his business.
Risk Benefits
Was he afraid to fly?
Hardly.
“I thought it satisfied the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank.
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to step up his position.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual income was about $51000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker, and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
However, he knew he would never earn as much as others.
“At my first meeting in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development, \"Kervelt told the investigation officer.
But soon after his entry came the first great success.
With the Allianz's shares, he earned a lot by setting half a billion euros for the loss of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, let's
“That’s like a snowball,” he said to the police.
But the chiefs allegedly knew about everything, or they did not know.
As long as I made money, my eyes were closed.
But then at the beginning of this year the great blow came.
On a single day, he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to compensate for this.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer a bank employee.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they get to him?
He was suspicious of a holiday.
“I just took four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn’t take a vacation is one who doesn’t want you to look at him in the cards,” Ker much said.
The Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
The Czech Minister and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will allow the Czech Republic to reach 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns) in the next few years.
This is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programs.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns from the programme, companies and innovation.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into traffic expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can get from the fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The programme - companies and innovation - aims to help entrepreneurs and companies to gain funds for innovative enterprises.
In this way, companies are expected to gain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
In the previous EU funds acquisition, the Czech Republic among the new accession countries is among the least successful.
Nicaraguan court confirms twenty years in prison for ex-presidents
On Thursday, a court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced for financial fraud of $100 million (about 1.8 billion crowns) in 2003.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hazienda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state comes back behind, according to the news agency AP is currently unclear.
The chairman of the appeal court, Ileana Pérez, says it will now depend on the arrest officials whether to let Alemán be released from his prison or whether he has to go to prison.
A court ruled four years ago that Alemán had regularly moved money from the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to their relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually landed in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his 2001 election campaign.
Budget is through
Yes, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget designed by this government, and which was adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The current year was still approved with the support of the ČSSD (social Democrats) because it had been submitted to the Minister Sobotka (of this party), and the ČSSD could therefore not allow itself to reject it.
In contrast to the lively debate before voting on the distrust of the government, nothing dramatic happened at this time.
The House of Representatives favoured this traditional little, yet highly significant law in all peace.
This is a certain paradox.
All government starts and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the household, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is covered by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they devote more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
The state budgets have left under three weaknesses among the past Social Democratic governments, which cannot be eliminated at once for the 2008 budget:
The first is the high share of expenses committed by law, with not only pensions, but also social expenditure, which has decided the “slow” coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communist) last year before the elections.
The second is the deficitary fiscal policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction consists of the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and, in some ways, under control.
However, a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors have given up other sources of investment except income from taxes, loans and bank loans, often unconsidered debt bills, by which they owe their townhouses to excess.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts through massive sales of shares of the energy and other supply networks that they have received from the state in the course of privateisation.
Now this source has already been completed.
As far as we only adhere to official and checkable facts, we find that:
For a few years now, like the rest of the world, our economy has been going through a growth phase, the ČSSD of which is famous without neglect.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owe the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have been much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a huge shame, which is mainly attributed to the former governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are at least threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have been inflated to a huge extent in recent years.
Even if it has managed to cut off some of the unwise populist spending that year before the elections, it is clear that if in the near future it does not come to a shift in pension retirement age and to a pension reform, then virtually any policy in this country ends, and, no matter who is in power, it will remain nothing but pure administration.
It is only easy to exaggerate if it is said that then reigning politicians will become officials who share most of the tax revenue mechanically on pensions and social expenses.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but only the displacement of normal expenditure by duty spending can be covered by compliance.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns provided for in 2008 would have been superfluous if previous governments had not spent what was going on in the last ten years.
If we do not want it to really come to be from ruling politicians to become purely administrative officials, then we must be patient and this not all too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it can on taxes and fees to seek rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these enable a gradual enforcement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided together to fight the crisis on the financial markets.
This means that more than 100 billion dollars will go to the currency markets through auctions.
On these auctions, banks increase interest rates to which they are willing to borrow each other money.
For example, the U.S. Fed sends $40 billion on auction, another 24 makes it more comfortable for the European and the Swiss Central Bank.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to defence or abduction of the consequences of a financial crisis.
“This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can afford,” Bernard Baumohl wrote in a report for his customers from the Economic Outlook Group consulting firm.
“The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unoperated loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more billions more.
“The central banks must have been really afraid of what can still be accomplished when it comes to this process,” said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he said.
The central banks fear that if the banks themselves have hard access to bonds, their customers will also be more expensive loans.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession, possibly affecting economic growth around the world.
The central banks decided to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank interest rate used in the loan between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to borrow each other’s money, and that although the central banks of the United States, Canada, and Britain had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
“This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates,” said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of Reuters Agency.
Some analysts believe that this step of central banks contributes to the warming of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: The debates of the ecologists are illegal
Global climate changes damage alleged developing countries most.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the UN’s end-to-end international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book “A Blue, No Green Planet,” he argued that the debates of the ecologists were illegal.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which forms a strange mix of government representatives and those of non-government organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric they accompanied, and reality.
“The debate there is unstructured, it is a word-fire work that is only a substitute for a real solution to present problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech President emphasized in his book that his topic is very important to him and that he is therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction at the fact that his book appears in German translation because “I often meet on cartoons of my views.”
So, now, interested people could read his attitude undisputedly.
Klaus remembered that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He is an academic, capable of understanding and judging professional deals, has experience with statistics, and is also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he referred to the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are so normal that there is no consistent opinion among scientists that the consequences of current changes are not too big and serious and thus no threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, he considered it an experience with totalitarian systems to be unacceptable to impose on other unproven views, he considered this a dangerous restriction on freedom.
On questions from presenters, he repeatedly explained that he was not against \"a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who take no note of the relationship between effort and earnings.\"
On the same subject, Klaus had already spoken in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600,000 motorists have missed the time to exchange their old driver’s license, which is valid at the end of the year.
Today is the last day that you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities will be able to issue a new driver’s license until the end of the year.
The Ministry, however, does not fear that after New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will enter the streets without valid driving permission.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not changed their driver's license.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in the vehicle exchange, the offices of the capital are flooded with tenders, and the interest in the exchange continues to grow this week.
The city administration processes around 2,000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 144,000 motorists have not yet exchanged their driver's license.
The exhibition will be a new driver's license for 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a reduced period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Car drivers who do not create the required exchange until the end of the year and leave without a valid driver’s license are threatened with a fine from January.
The offender pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also use a reminder when misbehaving.
In case of a breach, the penalty can rise to 2,500 crowns.
According to previous information, those of the community can also be punished who do not travel at all.
He could, it said, threaten a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called on the offices to let Milde walk and impose a penalty of 1,000 crowns at most.
According to the Minister of Transport, Charles Hanzelka, no one threatens a thousand drone sentence.
The driver's license is a document in which everyone can decide whether to own it or not.
It’s not about a staff card that everyone, and that’s a valid one, should have.
People who no longer want to drive should give their driver’s license.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent municipal office or to send him to it by registration.
At the end of the year, driver tickets will be invalid, issued between 1964 and 1993.
However, drivers must gradually also exchange other types of driver tickets.
People with driver tickets from 1994 to 2000 still have three years of time for the exchange.
The validity of driver tickets issued in 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million additional driver tickets.
Court reduces penalties for detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koíařík, who are accused of having made a joint case with David Berdych's gang, were sentenced to 13 or 10 years in prison.
This was decided in a legal ruling by the Prague Supreme Court, which reduced its penalty by a two-year or two.
Originally, the detectives of the \"Office for the Fight against Organized Crime\" threatened 14 or 12 years.
There is no appeal against the present judgment, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused in this matter, but initially he faces the first-time judgment.
In other cases, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
No more can he be condemned.
In January 19 persons were convicted of taking part in robberys, and the Supreme Court today negotiated the vocation of 16 of them.
Most of the accused objected from the beginning to the charge with the reasoning that it was a constructed case.
According to the Middle Bohemian District Court, members of the police passed information from police sources in consultation with Berdych, covered various robbery incidents, and helped members of the gang to escape prosecution.
The band left Opava and Koyasařík 30 percent of the prey for this.
The charge was about crimes of the gangs from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, because of robbery, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also because of office and unauthorized gun ownership.
In case of house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
The band has been charged with a number of millions of crowns due to its robbery.
Except for almost 20 men in this proceedings, Berdych courts and a number of others recognized as guilty of further robbery.
Other men from Berdych’s circle have to be held accountable in another trial, and further cases have not yet come before the court.
The main deal has so far been rejected by Tomáš Péta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody and who are waiting for the final decision on their extradition for criminal prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a dismantling clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, of the hospital in Třebíč wants 12 million crowns of compensation plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million each, for the fathers two million each, and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent.
The right-wing representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore disagrees completely with the proposal of Velebas.
“We reject such a proposal, it is too high,” Dostál said after today’s negotiations.
“But in order to be able to form an opinion on this counter proposal, we need to consider what the opposite side has created.
We will find out if it has any statement value at all.
However, we believe that this should be for all in the hundreds of thousands,” Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should move between 100,000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At first, the family from Jabloíkov wanted a million crowns for every month she had not raised her biological daughter.
Veleba served as the basis for compensation negotiations, which he had received from the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children have suffered from mental damage and stress symptoms in different strength and depths, according to experts in the field of psychology and psychology.
The men left the stress situation better, even if they saw accusations against them, they could have prevented the confusion of newborns.
Women, in turn, face the consequences of the experienced trauma, as well as the fact that what is currently happening, Veleba added to the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the disbanding clinic in Třebíč on December 9 last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslaveice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloslavov.
At the end of October, the district chief of the Vysočina (Böhmische-Möhrische Hoch) handed over 100000 crowns to each family as a replacement for expenses that had been caused by the failure of the hospital in Třebíč, which is under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are under liability insurance by law.
In the event of doubt, they must go to a reserve fund, only to be able to apply for assistance from the carrier.
The courts have so far agreed to comparatively low amount of damages, the aid was determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, except for millions.
Polívka came to His Kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the fight for the brand \"Kingdom of Walachei\"
Although the judge at the district court in Australia used the term \"Walachian King\", the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in long-term work.
Polívka did not participate in the negotiations today.
His lawyer says the matter is probably not ended, but his client will probably be called up.
“The dispute is that Mr Harabiš and his team want to participate in Bolek Polívka’s popularity parasite,” Polívka’s attorney said.
All of them presented themselves with the words “Walachian Kingdom” just these actors and comedians.
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
“We have an almost ten-year job behind us.
Money creation and concepts of activities,” he said.
According to him, the cause is the dispute over money.
“After years, they have noticed that the project is successful and that they could have something of it.
They want to win parasite at our work,” he said.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the term \"Walachian King\" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993, the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
But that did not go along with the intention of establishing a fictional kingdom at that time.
Some years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of spending whale passes.
From an original fun action, a business and an entrepreneurship activity crystallized to which Harabiš then joined the establishment of the \"Walachian Kingdom\" company.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered discounts to its owners when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also suggested that Harabiš only used the mere idea that Polívka had made public for his business intentions in the broadcast “Management.”
“The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Walachian Kingdom,” the judge said.
But she added that the soul of Harabiš project and his team were those who had devoted themselves to him.
The cooperation of the parties disbanded today lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, Polívka and Harabiš have begun to raise the disputes that had crept into the “King Boleslavs I” as elected to the Saint-Auerlein’s Day.
The leadership role then took on the recommendation of Harabiš's Jarmila Šuláková as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed against Harabiš and his company the complaint that the court rejected today.
Clearness in the dispute could bring about the competition prepared by Harabiš for the throne and half a princess.
A new king should come out of this.
He didn’t want to betray details and an appointment yet.
“We don’t want to overrun anything.
It should be something like the king's move in the Walachei.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr Polívka can also register quietly,” added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advantage disappears
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving properties were not much worth, the quality of the gear circuit, the steering and the processing could be referred to as rather below average.
But now his successor, Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The combination with the name SW is still a bit further, and I only have to revised my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the too little head-freeness on the back seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the combination is designed so that no two-meter men will suffer.
Fast forward
I just go through the interior to avoid repeating myself too much.
This is a fairly successful design, where I have objections only because of the air-conditioned central tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more design, where the car would otherwise make such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times when we may complain about too short seats or headrests.
The side attitude has also been significantly improved compared to the 206.
As far as the room offer is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In combination, the above-mentioned lack of head freedom has also been eliminated.
Bag in the suitcase room
The main thing about this car, however, is the charging room.
I have to describe (also because of the foldable back window) as very well loadable and space-saving.
The caves are equipped with holding belts that provide an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, can be pulled apart and hold more heavy objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table, it is 428 litres in basic equipment, which is a more average value compared to competition.
However, not in comparison to the best-selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains around clearly visible 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when inviting a children’s car, this value is already critical.
But in order to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat charging space or the very low loading edge after the overlap of the rear seats.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder-benzin engine with a lift space 1.6 liters and a power of 88 kWp.
And honestly, it should look like a 1600 cubic engine that drives a family hitsback.
He is quiet, has a low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes acts as if his outpouring was clogged with a lap, then I can only be excited by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
But we need to remember that we tested a well equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400s petrol engine at the height of 329900 crowns is still going on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment premium of the test car hits again with 80,000 crowns in addition to book.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc wiper release, electric window lifters at the back and...
So the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
This is a lot, but once you calculate the additional equipment of a Fabia together and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So only the choice of which brand you want to choose remains.
The integration of Slovak students at British schools is not successful
At British schools, the number of children from Eastern Europe is increasing, resulting in local fears about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far been subject to a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original residents are increasing in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe at British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where disputes between local and Slovak immigrants gradually increase.
Disputes, skikans, and rapture among students have transferred to the relationship between the parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended that the boy had insulted them with racist insults.
Police also had to take action on a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two underage girls.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and had him stoned.
“When we went home, a boy climbed on a bushout and spooked at us.
When I told him he would stop, he threw us with apples and pears and then blew his gun,” a mother of Slovak students in the newspaper The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even referred to the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases in question prove that the mood between locals and immigrants at British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks have been reported to have come here in search of work.
Some 30,000 Slovak students are therefore attending British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday will be fulfilled if you just choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea, which is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waitresses that offer pizza, ice cream and enchanting cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was its bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a warehouse or passage camp of treasures that the Spanish had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was created at the end of the 20th century.
It was one of the chiefs of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the U.S. (especially during the prohibition), was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were a.k.a.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high houses grew over the broad boulevards, cars that were among the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought himself an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havanas, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over the Americas left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autogram.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails for yourself according to your wishes.
And the cult cars of the fifty-fifties drive around in Havana to this day, because the once imported skigulis and fiats have long been falling apart in the salty and humid air.
May Havana, in particular its oldest part, have come down strongly, nowhere can you find as many wonderful colonial sights as it is right here.
Other places are just pumped out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the urgent need for money, there was green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years not only new hotels have been created in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers a marotte that is unique in the world and attracts railway lovers in particular.
The sugar pipe of remote ovens brought vapor and the same-driven narrow-track tracks to the sugar factories.
Your car park has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see putty and fully functioning locomotives, whose ageing companions are in the museum for a long time.
_Other Organiser
The most important places do not leave the majority of visitors to Cuba.
So you don’t need to write about Varadero or Havana any more in detail.
Please note that in the already mentioned estate, Hemingways is a museum whose visit should not be avoided by the author.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque angles.
The abundant vegetation grows on lime floor.
The mogotas, lime hills and rocks, rigged steeply from the valley floor, in their caves gathered fertile soil, through which also wet rock areas of dense vegetation are covered.
This valley is where the perhaps best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when visiting one of Havana's cigarette factories.
It may also seem interesting that the Chilean follow-up to the television series Major Zeman was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city, which was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
His fame and wealth brought him the trade of slave and sugar.
The wealth was embodyed in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has changed little for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road that connected the area to the rest of the country.
This isolation helped to prevent it from being neglected.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was glad he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it’s worth watching interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón Beach or the “Tall of Sugar factories”
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, which lives after the darkness, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This town in the east of Cuba is known as the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading from Guantanamo have to overcome high and torn mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
These eastern suburbs of Cuba included UNESCO thanks to its unspoilt nature in its World Heritage Site.
The best chocolate is produced there, in the church one shows the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the rides of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present-day El Castillo Hotel, is seen several tabletops, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigarettes, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the pig bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, about all of this one could be written many pages.
But as you say, see better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too little soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the United States according to the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the words of Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should design a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan was not based on their ideas, but in Scotland the representatives of the countries agreed that units were stationed in the south of the country.
In addition to growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defense minister, Robert Gates, called on NATO units to increase activity, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in strengthening development aid.
“In Afghanistan, a forward development is detectable, but military power can only be a part of the solution.
Another part is to allow residents to start even a further development of the economy and security, says British Defense Minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level for five years according to the U.S. Army.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand by sixty percent.
NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in southern territory.
According to the United States, the allies, however, have reached an absolute limit with regard to the organisation and equipment of the units.
In concrete terms, they require further helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
“We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and about the way we can achieve them,” Gates said.
Today, the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hope, expressed himself.
“I am not pleased with what we have to land in Afghanistan and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that’s too little,” said De Hoop of Reuters Agency to conclude three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries involved, there has also been a dispute in recent months as to whether all allies in Afghanistan are giving their best.
Due to passivity, for example, Germany was criticized.
“The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
However, they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country,” Gates said.
The British Boulevard newspaper Sun called the German soldiers a failure this week.
“Afghan’s non-struggled: Germans make games while our boys fight,” wrote the Sun in a post complemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German picture newspaper went over to counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to a billion in 2009
On every Czech Republic, there is a state debt of 84000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to owe itself to 159.2 billion cons this year.
In early December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the improved development of the state budget policy.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
As a result, within the first nine months of this year, they rose by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have sunk by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its information on the state debt from the beginning of October.
There is a debt of 84,000 crowns on every Czech Republic.
Over the past year, the state owed itself more than 111 billion crowns.
“At present, thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, it seems that the border of a billion crowns may not exceed in 2009.
Next year’s debt should move between 900 billion and a billion crowns,” said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, the iHNed.cz server.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance, sees: “To exceed a billion we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly, it depends on the next household we don’t know.
If it should be shown that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could last until 2010.
But I don’t think about such a change,” he said.
Increased debt
The state debt comes from the debt of the state government and is mainly due to the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The State debt is financed by credit statements, state debt prescriptions, direct bonds or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt now rose to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The foreign debt of the state now rose by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable state debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September, and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the state debt rose to 6.5 years.
“The overall debt rose by 13 percent over the first to third quarter over the year, which is really a lot in view of how well the economy is doing.
It’s interesting that growth is especially evident in debt prescriptions, where growth is 20 percent.
It’s bad that debt increases, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes,” Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of state debt for 2007 indicate that the government planned for this year to include 159.2 billion crowns.
In early December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improved development of the state budget policy.
This amount is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the 91.3 billion launched.
Furthermore, it is a maximum planned means for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion crowns, a ten million reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of state debt payments for 43 billion and the rates for the bonds at the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented today to a court in Kchromoline.
According to her attorney, the British teacher, who had been charged in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison and subsequent imprisonment on Thursday evening by a court in Kchromatia.
The British was accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be cut out.
After parents of students complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher, who was working at the Unity High School of K Hygiene, was arrested at home on Sunday and charged in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code for the insult of Islam.
In fact, this matter takes its start in September when the teacher invites their six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah, and Mohammed, school principal Robert Boules reports.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but especially one in Sudan is a very common name.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the picture signature My name is Mohammed.
The bear itself bore no shield with this name, but the problem is quite simply that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered to be insulting Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew them well, and she would never have done anything to draw close to a religious belief, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, and his concern is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion that shares numerous students of the teacher who describe it as very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks about religion in class.
It is thought that the first name Mohammed is at the same time the second name given in the UK, which is the second most common name for which there are 14 different spellings in the English language.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is considered a kind of worship to the prophets (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But how do the rules in relation to the use of this first name sound?
Is it possible, for example, to give him a toy?
This, of course, is a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, there was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last meeting in Vienna.
At the end of the failure
Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final session on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not agree on the status, said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
With emphasis on the fact that the peace in the region is at stake, his American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina called on him to fulfill their obligations to maintain peace, and continue the talks beyond the end of negotiations.
No acts of violence will be expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are very significant tensions.
End of orders on 10 December
The representatives of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province inhabited by 90% of Albanian speakers could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The discussions of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last session since the Troika was commissioned by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their commission to end on December 10th.
The Russians, who had already blocked the recognition of Kosovo's independence at the Security Council, are continuing the negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and remains a spokesman for a negotiated solution, a reasonable solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
One-sided Declaration of Independence?
After having been under UN administration for eight years, Kosovo has held independence under EU supervision for the only solution with the future.
Pristina is ready to announce this one-sided if the Security Council should not decide their favors.
Belgrade is based on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached , the President of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Cosovarian Rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade belonged to the autonomy of a past that led to murders and deportations.
Domino Effect
The Serbian President Boris Tradic, on the one hand, held that a compromise was always sought and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a one-sided declaration of independence from the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly a “domino effect” in a region that is still so weakened by the war of independence of the 90s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision be made only by one and only one in the Security Council, where its Russian allies are entitled to a veto right.
Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only one decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
You must end up as they started: in the Security Council.
The journalist replied to Fatmir Sejdiu that Kosovo's parliament will have the last word on the status, adding that any one-sided declaration of independence from sides of the Albanian-speaking people will be in agreement with the Western countries.
Bush creates an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which was held on Tuesday under its leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He further explained that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations to find a final regulation of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must destroy terrorist infrastructures and Israel must set up its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitment to the plan for peace that they had agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief emphasized that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian government under Abbas's final agreement should seek a peace treaty to clarify all open questions without exception, including the central issues.
This term covers the three grave problems that mainly revolve around the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees displaced from their homes in the present state of Israel in the wake of the 1948 conflict.
According to the U.S. President, Abbas received the word and insisted that the upcoming negotiations be carried out comprehensively and thoroughly and provide an arrangement for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
As Olmert took the word to his side, he committed to leading the upcoming ceasefire negotiations directly and without interruption and to making sure that they can be completed before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states, a Palestinian and an Israeli next to each other, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received assurance from Bush in this sense from Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a great success for Washington, has led to a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a separate path in the history of the Middle Orient, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central viewpoints, the Saudi-Arab prince in his interview with the Arab-language newspaper funded by Saudi funds.
According to the state attorney, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always in this kind of local news, official versions and rumors are facing.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the National Disciplinary Authority of Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 17 p.m., a police car headed on the Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on stripes, and drove 40-50 km/h, without bluelight, a spokesperson for the police.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without permission, not released for public road transport (see below), came controlled by two young people without a helmet, at a very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it had ignored its advance from the right, a police officer continued.
The alcohol control carried out in the vehicle passengers has a lot of negative effects.
The condition of the car (against cot wing, split wind shield, torn down rod) is evidenced by the heftiness of the impact.
Very quickly, already yesterday morning, the state attorney of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced that she had entrusted the IGP to the IGPn an investigation about the 'facts of involuntary person's murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger', in accordance with Val-d`Oise's main opinion on public safety.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the state attorney explained that it excludes the IGPN from the responsibility of police officers at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police, namely, that this small-powered wheel has arrived on their left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday, a type of rills, certainly caused by the friction of foot-raids on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained locked together until the policemen managed to brake.
The vehicles were seized and will be subject to a technical assessment.
The names of the two victims were discovered yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the round, as a result of which police officers had left the accident site very quickly, and that without providing the two young people help.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also exclude any serious errors.
According to one police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation that further investigations are needed, and in which we must take very careful action.
Libération hit an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had direct views of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital to try to relive her, this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely destroyed police officer who was sinking.
Two other attempts were made to revive one of the young people who phoned fourth.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the event and, as it seems, because of the certainty that the persons present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen from colleagues who had been caught at the accident site were taken into the car.
Still, according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the policeman's departure.
They also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police forces would have given no help to the young people.
The first aid was given to these young people.
The firefighter came immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, but it emphasized the state attorney.
In Pakistan, the tension is rising
On Monday, Pakistani police defeated the first demonstrations since General Musharraf had been called out of emergency two days earlier.
According to testimony, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken under the state of emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades who used the orderly forces there.
Jene then threw stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested temporarily.
Similar scenarios were held in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been arrested temporarily.
In Islamabad, the attorneys of the Supreme Court have appealed to a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests by oppositionals, defendants of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning the roads leading to the Supreme Court were blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations were held in Multan (Middle) and in Peshawar (Northeast).
The lawyers’ movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the population to send flowers to the judges who opposed the state of emergency, and the waste that had taken an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf’s promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special action announced on Saturday evening.
He had to refer to President Musharraf's legality in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was deposed and dismissed.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the Magistrate of The News said.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to surrender the commander of the army and to become a civilian president no longer applies since the call for emergency, said on Monday the Vice Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would release his military uniform until November 15, when his first term as president ends.
The Vice Minister of Information has also confirmed that the elections could be postponed by January.
In addition, the Pakistani government detonated the rumours of the country, according to which President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy army leader.
More than a third of the pregnancies are still not planned.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed the prevention of conception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of prevention such as the pills or the spirals still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which found that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of age who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of pregnancy prevention has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
Eight out of ten births have been carefully planned today.
For one out of five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have spent more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is essential for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools mastered by the astronauts to perform the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had downloaded Harmony from the Discovery spacecraft, a large cylinder-shaped part that was soon to take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a type of landing bridge for the module labs.
But you need to be able to supply it with electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to implement a 17.5-ton module for power generation via solar collectors already located on the ISS to bring it to its final position.
After it moved, the crew made itself to the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module, whose span was 76 meters.
And in this case it happened that one of the collectors that could be folded like chordeone was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was stopped to no longer damage the collector.
The astronauts, who originally left Discovery for a walk and then had to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was flawed, saw themselves forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30 meter long remote controlled arm of the spacecraft that had been fitted to the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skilled, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old learned doctor was selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully observing the damage, he separated the faulty cable and attached some type of rail on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who stayed near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used was a mini-hockey hitter, wrapped with an insulator to prevent an electric hit on the solar collectors, which generated several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station designed and mastered.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to Discovery to join the Earth on Wednesday.
Title EADS on the stock exchange sanctioned
After the Aviation and Defense Group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros in order to counter the A400M residues, the EADS share is currently showing a significant decline in the Paris stock market.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21,96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review their 2007 business forecasts once again referring to the residues caused by the slow development of the A400M engine that delayed the plane's maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amounted to between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus, the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operational performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when its quarter-year results are presented, it added without further detail.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new costs is related to the six-month residue.
To remember, EADS’ business performance fell from 86% in 2006, mainly due to the delay of another program, at the cost of the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had provided a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army for October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
On Sunday, it will not be exciting to count the urns: the Russians will decide for President Putin’s Party, Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, she confirms her pursuit for stability, even after authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a message to the voters, who have already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his property as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kreml Party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President did not see anything through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was pleased to deliver a new point of attack against the West Powers, who are accused of interceding -- his favorite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of genuine democracy and hope we have honest elections, extremely transparent and open, without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have gone there.
She faces an electoral struggle that has been maligned by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of each other.
After the oppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstrations, according to his lawyer, to continue visiting.
The Russians have maintained the mentality of Homo Soviets
After these no-voltage parliamentary elections, two more questions arise:
Who will join Putin’s successor as president?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December time to announce themselves.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot enter into a third mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the majority of parliament and the all-powerful party of Russia, the government and president will be elected?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the power of the present will triumph.
This is tradition.
The Russians have maintained the mentality of Homo Soviets, they are not Lord of their fate, says Sociologist Lev Goldkov, director of the Independent Centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of Saint Petersburg goes back even further: the civil society in this country, which was christened to Europe for five centuries, has only developed very slowly; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
According to the liberal reforms of the 90s, Putin has rebounded to the model of a paternalist state, which was completely adopted by the population, all the more, since this new paternalism did not follow terror, but a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman says from the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians, out of free pieces, reject personal responsibility, which they have put in place shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
Why have you been thinking about that for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
And the administration elite understands to hold the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local election lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often similar to chaos, as in the 90s.
The generality prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will also not vote for the extremist parties.
The conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why do you think so long?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why are they disfellowshiped?
A hard reminder
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are located at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, have not yet been viewed, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individual and so-called, i.e. on the question of a former victim or its members.
The eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to make them accessible to researchers and historians in May 2006.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for research to be conducted, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the health condition of forced workers, explains Reto Masters, leader of this archive managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these so-called public documents accessible to the public, due to the hefty nature of certain information.
Like, for example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The inmates lists of the concentration camps or the arrest orders issued by the Gestapo were carried out for a practical reason after the war: civilians who were deported or subjected to forced labor were found, and possibly to provide them with a means of proof of their arrest in order to break their way to their compensation.
Even today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 fixed tens of thousands of personal requests are being processed.
However, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
There is nothing to expect from these documents, Mr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, 2006 explained.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching the €60 billion per year.
The EU is India’s most important trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU foreign ministers had given the European Commission a green light to open negotiations last April, with a view to signing free trade agreements (AL) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). The mutual trade between India and Europe has already reached €60 billion a year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth EU trade partner.
A free trade deal will greatly advance the two economic areas and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the 10 most frequently exported products exported by India, explained by the European Commissioner. The Asian and European Giants exchange goods annually worth €47 billion and services worth €10 billion, had declared Daniéle Smadja, chairman of the European Commission's administration in New Delhi, and regrets that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India will meet on Friday to their eighth diplomatic in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned about preventing the current recurring concern over the terms of credit, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual duration.
In order to weaken the fears, which, according to the conditions in the financial market, will be particularly hard at the end of the year, and to give the banks a greater certainty of the way in which they should organize their liquidity positions at that time, the bank has the intention of offering a significant part of their savings deposits during the conservation phase starting on 6 December, in the form of an open-market operation for five weeks .
The Bank further explains that on 6 December, by 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation, at the basic tax rate and only by 10 January.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE has been in an open-market operation of liquidities for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds, in its communication, that it is willing to take further measures to obtain the interest rates of interbank loans from day to day with their base interest rate.
On Wednesday, the rate of interbank interest varied from day to day was 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate has relied on 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis of the summer, the sums of fines issued by the Bank of England have been coupled with fines that the banks had held from taking advantage of.
According to certain rumors, reinforced by the development of the pound rate in contrast to the euro, many prefer to sign for the sums that have been circulated by the European Central Bank, to more advantageous interest rates and with safer discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review the PS's proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which corresponds to a rejection of the text.
The text, developed in the context of a socialist niche (sitting on the initiative of a parliamentary group), provided for about ten measures taken on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, most of which are 50% for employment, re-entering the TIPP fleet, for a transport check or for limiting rents.
After UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which led to partially fierce debates between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on the purchasing power.
The leader of the MPs of PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the overallity of their proposals as an amendment to the legislative action plan for the correction of finances that had been reviewed by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no longer and no less, has served as a model for the current festival movement in America , Charlie Jones of C3 told Bilboard.com.
C3 is the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will take place from August 8-10, on a 500 acre large private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The leader of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world’s most renowned festival producers.
In 1989 he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, attracting 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added his portfolio to the Leeds Festival, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also taken care of production as a co-owner for the license concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event in which he has ever been in, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn are working parallel to each other in order to offer the area a festival event in European style.
We have selected Philadelphia as a market and are actively working with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in Philadelphia's city centre, Charlie Jones says.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained in political debates regarding the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
“We were fortunately able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately benefit the population.
C3 Presents has revived the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at the Chicago Grand Park, after it profiled together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002 in the world of the festival.
In 2007, the two events were able to achieve $9.8 million and $11.8 million each on gross tax days.
These two festivals take place in urban environments.
“The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas the unsightly are more likely to take place on the urban greens,” says Charlie Jones.
\"The objective is to merge these two concepts in one way or another to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival in the European and urban ways of the American.
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes up the burden of this event with joy,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refused to award the amounts of the agreement, but confirmed that “they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to include a festival that will hopefully have a long life.”
Charlie Jones says that the festival’s recording capacity, which is very large, is about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
“Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
His partner of C3, who has received the top independent promoter award of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets on the terminator.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal when there is no lower than the terminator.
These lock attempts are part of the delegated tasks.
A political “healing mandate” - because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who claims to be Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to deal with the “governator”?
“You have to be careful, because it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are considered the best,” he says.
The Run at the Festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, at the moment the introduction of the cinema there is a top priority.
The hunt for the Oscars began.
At all the festivals on the west coast, although that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec to evaluate them and make sure that the producers have interviews.
The dark age had a successful idea at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and is presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec has also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Does the stock exchange have an end-year rally? Disunity among the experts due to the U.S. mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks until the end of the year on the stock market, investors are already driving their hands with regard to the coming end-year rally.
However, the experts can’t create safe predictions.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock market usually starts with a positive market development
However, it is not advisable to create forecasts in short-term terms and only on the basis of statistics, especially if serious tensions determine the current market event.
Although other experts do not approve such a strong rise in the last few weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the exchange rate is determined by the market and market participants’ due to the lack of secure stock funds, mainly in pension funds, which is heavily affected by the up-to-date trend towards earning assets.
As a result, these experts believe the stock market will rather have a more lateral rate trend influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we are not yet able to estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the U.S. bank, an uncertainty which is mainly due to the rising crude oil price and the risk of the rise in inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a challenging time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, assured the expert.
The Spanish Ibex stock index has already lost a value of 4% since its highest mark on November 8 of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points due to the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional access to pension cash each year.
However, the expert points out that this year things could develop slightly differently; especially because of the final year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and hence immediately after the day of the bridge to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at the Bank Inversis, the previous ratings on the market position are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values, whose dimensions depend on the consequences of the U.S. mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
When choosing the values to drive the Ibex to new maximums, the analysts agree.
Solana of Intermoney considers that this year the great values are on the line.
Among the value winners, the expert would count the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the power sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha assures Bank Inversis that the increase in connection with the banking and industry sector will take place.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on the pick-up course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same path, the expert said.
With regard to increased consumer behavior during the Christmas season, market events will be determined in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive revenue results even if they are represented only in a small number in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been in two cases falling course.
When the technology blast was placed in late 2003, this led to the stock exchange from its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real year rally.
This year, in which Ibex raised 35 by 28.17 percentage points, December showed a 6.68% rise in rates.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth winning year (the Ibex has been rising by 8.36% since January) and can also show a final year rally will show up.
Popular will open its 200 credit institutions from Mondays to Fridays 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in Spain’s most economically strong regions.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches mean a large milestone.
But also for the remaining Spanish institutions, as popular as a first banking group, the jump is to extend the opening hours of its branches by 20.30h and to set up Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The BBVA banking group, which has also repeatedly read the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a final decision.
The current negotiations of the Bank with the trade unions seem to aim at an agreement, with 75% of all branches being closed on Saturdays and open on a weekday afternoons, though not for the customer.
Whether other banks join the new initiative that adapts to the opening hours will depend on the experience of the Popular Bank.
And that’s also the intention that popularly pursues with your project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, due to their location, can capture the buying customership of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large shopping houses.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as they are not new but modified opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will remodel the premises of those branches already located in business zones, while at the same time comparing them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of the opening hours is connected to a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more modern, colorful design.
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require larger investments, but with an increased staff setting, since a branch now no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The branches of Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently leads about 2500 branches.
And another 60, operating under the name Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants and also having extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-finance services for sale.
We don’t want to compete for our customers, explains Rivero.
With telephones, they have temporarily come to the agreement to sell mobile phones using external banking personnel.
The Spanish private station Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this statement, the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the conclusion of the stock exchange.
One aspect, however, paralyzed his joy: that's exactly what hurt me; not that we had a higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He emphasized that despite the weak market, they are not too deep.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company’s value now reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the capital’s capital (52%), and Vocento only being involved with 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and since January has reported a loss of 40.5%, so its market value is 2,193.46 million to half.
In the case of Sogecable, the market value of other exchange-listed communications companies is increasing to 3,571 million, at Prisa (Cinco Días magazine) to 2,518,53 million and at Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that these are two similar companies, Vasile said.
Unquestionably, the question still arises as to the extent to which we can actually operate trading technology, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
Telecinco announced a week ago his project to raise the first television channel with more than 1,000 million gross profits from advertising revenue, which assured Guiseppe Trenali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising company of the group.
If the project was to be implemented, the transmitter would increase its advertising revenue compared to the 365.4 million from the previous year by 3.6%.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales rose by 1.6% in the first nine trading months (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business could only have an increase of 0.7% (630.4 million ).
The main factor for telecinco’s better stock market history is that the analysts see the high payout ratio the company could have up to the present time: In 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría caused a 100-percent dividend dispensation.
Vasile, however, assures that after purchasing 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged to pay out at least 50% of the shares to the official compromise, even if we have given up much more so far.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we could already increase by purchasing 33% of the end-mol shares.
According to the analysts, the market currently has some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco for this year by 4% and 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10.5% to 8.4% and 2009 from 5.5% to 5.1%.
It also reduced Antena 3’s expected profit calculation by 4.5% for 2008 and 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.

Congress approves the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to the parliamentary work, which today ended its meeting with Congress decision in the Senate on the additional/change requests related to the project, the government published the provisions arising from the new law with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations until the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the Congress and Senate officers who had pursued in their negotiations and votes the aim of setting up the best possible rules to ensure the safety of investors and regulate individual business activities in order to ensure a generally efficient market event.
In addition to modernizing the financial markets, the MIFID, which re-assesssssssssssssssssssssssssss the efficiency of the securities service order, pursues an improvement in investor protection, increase the control claim of the Spanish securities commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows both specialized companies and natural or legal persons to offer financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the consulting companies that join the investment and procurement companies of securities.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, so that the regulated circulation markets add the quantitative systems of the securities business and the systems for internationalizing trade orders that would eventually compete with current economic actors.
The law requires investment companies to identify the focus of their corporate profile, confrontation and handling of risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate CNMV’s control task.
The Economic Commission of Congress, in turn, made further changes, stating that the debt prescription provided for by titles must now be considered a complex financial means due to its high risk level for the investor, confirmed by the U.S. mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal restriction of the employment of diplomats of economic scientists was used; 30 years after 1977 the Regulation, which limited the working areas reserved for economic scientists, was adopted.
On the one hand, the Senate established new positions in the financial sector, such as those of the economic mediator working on a foreign account, does not require authorization by CNMV and can offer its services for commercialisation of products and for customer recovery at the same time several investment companies.
The Harmonized Consumer Price Index (VPI) rose by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator, which is used to assess the inflation rate within the European Union, provides the average price development taken in Spain in November.
Its publication is in accordance with the principles of the European Central Bank and the European Central Bank (EZB), which, through the disclosure of the data, aim for a local and quality comparison to U.S. products.
The forecast for the indicator can be created in advance by applying the same procedure as with the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using a variety of other statistical modeling methods to estimate the information not present at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistics Office (INE) warned that the early determined indicator would only serve as a target value, and therefore would not have to agree with the final result announced on the next December 14th.
The consumer price index (VPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Chief of Government and Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs Pedro Solbes, the rise of the VPI in November was a temporary development; at the same time, it assured that the price index would continue to remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However, in the halls of the Congressional Building, Solbes noted that even if the current number is not good, Spain’s inflation difference has more or less remained the same among the other members of the Monetary Union in recent years.
In addition, he explained that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high rise.
We expected a value of around 4% , the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates with Northern Rock revenue of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
Northern Rock's assets fell by more than half after the bank crisis-related crisis in mid-September of last year asked the UK emergency bank for an emergency loan, and they now amounted to only 12,000 million pounds (which amounts to €16,800 million).
At the time, the bank’s assets amounted to a record $25,000 million, a sum significantly reduced within two and a half months by the customer’s loss of trust and, despite the government’s hundreds of percent guarantee, the money will continue to be secure until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the Virgin Money brand name, must bring in about a quarter of the income of the UK banks, which will be composed there from the facilities of the next three years, in order to acquire exactly the 18 billion pounds that will still be needed to achieve their goal of 30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for its outstanding advertising campaigns in the UK, aims to let 50,000 million pounds (equivalent to about €70 million) flow annually in advertising and marketing campaigns in order to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, in which three more companies are involved, as its preferred bidders to lead it out of bankruptcy.
The Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participating in urban corruption
The Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the township of Totano (Partido Popular) belonging to the city community this morning, due to the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption, which was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretarys of the municipal council and the chief of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo told Juan Morales’ office, currently a member of the Partido Popular and then chairman of Totana's municipal council, and, according to information from the broadcaster, Cadena SER could be the original cable tractor of the company.
The officials continue to cover the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales’ lawyer was accused of being the main suspect in the case of urban corruption, discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to the Cadena SER, the lawyer was arrested by the popular , and consequently privileged MP Juan Morales upon leaving the residence of his client on the basis of important documents to be related to the Court of Justice.
In addition, other sources of information from the supposed order payments of morale are reported to a galic construction company, which provided for the conclusion of a city-building contract in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
At present, eight people are in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo and, in case of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who will therefore lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of an election of the Socialists, take office of the President of Congress.
For example, José Blanco, the organization secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced in the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero was held in the party's headquarters today.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is acceptable, as it is important in politics to be able to count at the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the socialists, the mancha-based politician would appear to be candidate for the party in the upcoming elections as chairman of Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as President of Congress, who had announced last November 15 that he would no longer join in the next general elections, end his career in public policy, and instead engage in the university field of climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the government president had constantly pushed on his return to political action.
Moreover, he pointed out that the party, as in the appointment of the Vice-President for Economy, would not want to discourage citizens who would take over the position of President of Congress in the event of an election victory, and referred to this as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to convert the chamber into a house of respect and not the insult or screaming to make it seem more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, you gain the impression as if the only place where you can't speak calmly and let go of it in Madrid is Congress; so the President of the Government was interrupted once in the Senate up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to give the impression that he had already taken office, since otherwise his political opponents would call it arrogant.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate is taking the lead both in the skeptics of climate change and in those who put a social and political debate to the fore, there must be an unmerciful criticism of the movement as a whole.
Especially when it comes to a leader of the movement, who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new contract with the planet.
This proposal, however, brings him to the fore with regard to his government’s actions or non-handlings, which has played a key role in the fact that Spain is at the top of the EU, at the very least meeting the requirements of the Kioto Protocol.
Who are responsible for the failure to meet the requirements on which sectors this is due, and why has his government, which had proposed the Treaty with the planet, not stopped this development?
In addition, he is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures he has provided against climate change without wavering.
Which companies will be affected by which actions of citizens are to be changed, which individual and collective savings measures must be implemented, and which economic consequences result.
More precisely, who has to sacrifice and pay for the planet's rescue.
However, there is and will be no such explanations in the future.
It’s because it’s about sacrifice and payment.
The measures that can really be taken against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE, Zapatero appeared to be so strategically so dangerous that he saw himself forced to resume the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With its agreements with the planet, the other politician must not speak, complain, or demand, but instead follow the demanding issue of adorning the meetings and of admiring others with its gentleness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not specify that the bike will become the only means of forward movement in the future or that we should only be able to conquer with a fan.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to a supposed involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the locality of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo, and the local police chief, the secretary of the mayoral office and a hotel contractor for the alleged suspicion of urban violations, has also been arrested.
The city council was arrested at its residence, from where it was brought to the municipal office and in its premises it has been located to the present time, surrounded by numerous agents who had also been contacted by the urban administration and by the municipal district of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are in connection with the last Monday in Galicia, Murray and Madrid, in which it was found that more than 2 million hectares of undisclosed construction ground for urban projects under the management of the Gaelic construction firm Nuaria should be redesigned, which should be built on the property of 4,000 apartments after local administration has read illegal provisions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two more persons were not directly arrested, but were subject to an investigation procedure which is caused and carried out by the first court of Totonas.
The first six prisoners were brought before the judge today.
According to investigation circles, it is also determined against the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP deputy Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, is under suspicion in the country.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the township of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the CEO of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company was to have been a subgroup of Nuaria and received the bribe money.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban offences, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, committed eleven other searches, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests held in Madrid, Vigo, Murray, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally well-known poultry breeding plant, which was to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria construction group was assigned to build the largest residential complex of the locality belonging to Murray, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometers of land in Totana, which was to be converted, with the aim of achieving a construction project, which would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar that promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things That Can Happen
1.
If you agree to this, we will turn away from the express book of the month and instead try to invent a price label of other names with corresponding competences.
I already have a proposal.
People who live mean change.
Of course, you are welcome to submit your suggestions.
2. (a) What is
Our Finnish correspondent explains the comment to us yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat, published (Finland is at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment in the same newspaper, published on November 18th; by chance on that day whose issue contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy around the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is an abiturent who quoted in his news the works of Platons and Nietzsches.
In an interview of the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the Chair of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, urged the teacher to take a more critical position towards Plato and suggested that the teaching be removed from the undergraduate curriculums for the philosophy of gymnasium.
3. (a) What is
A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a breach of law, which would be committed with six months' imprisonment.
However, if you re-enact a music store under a value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you expropriate the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft will be as a criminal offence, however, the penalty will be lower than in a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you clap a car and return it forty hours later, then the penalty is still lower than in a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less difficult to participate in a stroke than in a music data exchange.
To participate in a rebel dispute, a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the data exchange results in a six-month withdrawal of freedom for up to two years.
(Article 270 Penal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less bad than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, whose authorization has not taken place by the authors, will be exposed to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Now yes, so if my colleague should be right, then someone's demands have been very scrambled.
4. (a) What is a relationship? (b) What is a relationship?
My doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially if the others get more of it.
So the feelings that result from the monthly wage payment are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was created using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the Science magazine.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Brain Research Center Life&Brain, activation was then the strongest if the participant gave correct answers and failed his partner.
The researchers were able to recognize that brain activity was always very moderate, if both participants were properly laid down with their response and thus also received the same salary; but when one of them received double, it also resulted in a stronger brain activity.
I am not very sure if it really requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
State candidate from the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been irreprehensible after the criminals of the Balkan Wars. Her office is located in the prosecutor’s office of the former Yugoslavia’s criminal court, located in La Haya.
Her mandate will run out at the end of the year, and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and a laughing eye, as the chief controllers of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - are the ex-General Ratko Mladic and former Serbo-Bosan leader Radovan Karadzic.
Their names are on the list that Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach has not yet launched as a template for the title of his documentary La Liste de Carla (2006) in Spain; a film that, with the pace of a politic thriller, pursues the Swiss state attorney from Belgrade to New York in her plans to detect the escapeing criminals and put the respective governments under pressure to narrow their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
The KFZ insurance, which covers a possible damage case caused by the driver, includes a high cost expenditure whose height depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driver's license, family status, type of car and its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, one must be clear about what we have to do with it here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance company.
This Agreement shall be held in writing by means of an insurance contract stating that the Company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged, in return, to submit the corresponding amount of deposit in the event of a damages.
The insurance premium is the price of insurance composed by several factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driver's license, family status, type of vehicle to be assured or its use.
Insurance companies determine their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contribution payments will also be due in the event of a higher risk of accident.
For this reason, more than 25-year-olds and women need to make fewer contributions, since statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same also applies to married people, as they, according to the statistical values and therefore also after the firm’s conviction, tend to have fewer accidents than single individuals.
The benefits that are measured to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus also the probability of an accident.
The more often the use, the more likely the damage.
In setting up the premium, the insurances must take into account a whole range of points.
For this reason, the driver also needs to study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that meets his or her most personal needs.
We now list the most important points to consider when choosing an insurance in order to be able to make not only a performance-oriented but also a price-oriented choice.
The 25-year-olds face numerous obstacles when choosing a low-price insurance, such as the low driving practice and the young driver’s license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance protection to complete full-casco insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full-casco with self-control so that the services of a full-casco insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay part of the amount generated by the damage himself.
The amount is set before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher than the amount to be paid , says Luis Noguera, Chief Representative of Spain at First Europe, an online insurance agency.
Another option is the extended insurance, which assures customers against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a council.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs; so increase your credit by trying to drive cautiously and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction of the basic tariff in the corresponding insurance company.
On the other hand, a penalty payment includes an increase in tariffs.
The amount of credit and penalty payments depends on the company and its earnings.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it may allow itself to increase bonus payments, Noguera explains.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practice, the accident rate falls.
Thus, it is most useful to opt for full-casco insurance with self-involvement.
Usually, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, the Spanish CEO of the European company explains, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the initial fear has been dropped.
However, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not own children to complete full-casco insurance; of course, only if it allows the financial situation of the relevant person.
On the part of the applicant, married couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly low also their contribution payments fall.
In this case, full-casco insurance with self-involvement (with an amount of around 300 euros) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which will only be used for the third year of the vehicle.
They all drive more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution, says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is possible to complete full-casco insurance with self-involvement (in the case of an amount of 150 euros), or to complete an extended insurance that is only used with a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it must be held that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it provides high costs that require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow is looking forward to the eighth final in Milan.
The FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight for the point they lack on Tuesday to reach their respective goals before completing the Champions’ League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group while it decides to participate in the Scottish.
The Italian team already has five points and has already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a disagreement in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points still needs another one to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not pick up the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place a week before the end of the sixth round of the game, as the FC Milan will have to join the FIFA Club World Championship in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the semi-finals for entry to the final, which will take place on the 16th.
Thus, this group will be completed above all others and the undisputed at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the ever-awaited result, even though both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home about the Celtic Glasgow that they would have in the event of a winning group star and would thus have a better starting position in the eighth final.
Gordon Strachan’s team could even have a defeat in a blow of FC Shakhtar, but he shouldn’t rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points equal standing the Ukrainians were able to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but were able to win in the second game (2-0).
Therefore, the Milaners will try to avoid the shots the evening, which, again, hope to reach the eighth final of the redesigned Champions League for the second time, after being defeated in the previous season in exactly the same round by a goal of Kaka in the after-game time (1-0) and by a zero to zero indistinctions on the play.
While the FC Shakhtar is waiting for the Rossoneri victory, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the eighth-final and membership at the UEFA depend on their victory and defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win third place by a win and thus compete at the UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave in the Canadian Vancouver front of 20,000 spectators the launch committee for their first tour after the band's release in 2000.
\"Posh Spice\" (Victoria Beckham), \"Scary Spice\" (Melanie Brown), \"Baby Spice\" (Emma Bunton), \"Sporty Spice\" (Melanie Chisholm) y \"Ginger Spice\" (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before her concert at the stadium GM Place de Vancouver that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people were able to experience the concert at the sold-out stadium, where a video about the band's history, which had been provided for Furore in the late 1990s, was shown.
The reunification and world tour overlaps with the release of a new album, which includes its biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and Voodoo, which appear in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden bracelets on stage, which had previously been given to them by the husband of Posh Spice, English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fan masses in the audience who brought the GM Palace to the glow, although the nerves of his spouse Victoria had forbidden him in the preceding days.
While preparing for the show, Victoria Beckham told us that the British Star has not received our wardrobe only once, so I’m already very excited about what he’ll keep from appearing.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal differences of opinion two years later moved the group's resolution, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of world publicity had changed that the feelings had changed to the Spice Girls.
And that’s why I thought it wasn’t; so I’m happy to have made this decision, Chisholm said to the separation of the band she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also announced that the disputes had been eliminated and now everyone likes to be back.
However, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of Spice Girls in 1998.
At first, the group, according to report from the television station CTV, arrived in a special machine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
Upon arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army from a child girl.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will be held next in California, in San José (December 4th) and in Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid, they will enter the stage on December 23.
New fears of natural gas conflict between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute erupted between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk of affecting Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is very closely observed.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, Russia will charge higher transit fees.
An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow happens at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be more calculated as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkey.
Analysts say that this could mean Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in conversation,” said Ukraine’s Minister of Economic Affairs Anatoli Kinakh, Reuters news agency.
“The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] across Ukraine,
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut deliveries to Ukraine.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which dramatically pushed prices to the top.
Russian gas is a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world’s largest gas occurrence, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own supplies of gas from Turkmenist and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS 'must control foreign workers'
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the pre-prison register for workers from outside Europe, a member of the control body said.
The general financial controller Robert Black’s recommendation came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought to a close with the attack on Glasgow’s airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish State Health Service does not provide accurate ideas regarding the number of its foreign employees.
However, his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a case of five health authorities.
The chief financial controller examined personnel recruited outside the European Economic Area as a result of the attack at Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a terrain car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission in Old Bailey in October and was charged with the alleged car bomb attack in the UK.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks in advance of the appointment of foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experiences and authorizations to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review pre-prison registers, the Agency does not have the authority to obtain this information outside of the UK.
The chief auditor’s report now, in addition to other recommendations, states that the Board of Directors has adopted guidelines on the criminal registry extract that help employers with checks in various countries.
“Although we found references to these checks in some staff documents, they were not routinely carried out,” the report stated.
Black said Scottish health authorities would follow their research guidelines before a high level of employment, but added: “Our report shows areas in which the system can be improved to ensure accurate information about the number of foreign health service employees is available.
BMA Scotland chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was \"extremely unlikely\" that investigations in advance of the appointment of potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
“In the report, it says that NHS Scotland’s current pre-position tests work well and it’s not clear what added value the recommendations will provide,” he said.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the majority of which are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, even because the board had problems identifying those employees who are on vacation at an indefinite time.
The investigation continued to note that established control procedures of NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian have been largely held.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for controls before employment for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: “It was a concern to me that this work was carried out in view of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.
It added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices would reflect up-to-date guidelines on the control investigations in advance of the employment of all employees, including those from abroad, whose publication is scheduled next month.

208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it arrested 208 militants for their belonging to cells that had planned an upcoming attack on an oil plant as well as on spiritual and security forces.
State television of the world’s largest oil operator said one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets.
Al-Qaida’s sympathisers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-man strong rapid intervention call to protect the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an inner-ministeral statement, says that 18 of the arrested were part of a cell led by a “ rocket expert” who immigrated illegally to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
22 of the prisoners were reported to have killed spiritual and security forces.
The government has warned more to stop Saudis seeking Iraq to join Al Qaida militias, who want to fight the Allied forces and the U.S.-supported Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the hardliners among Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaida militias consider many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in supporting the politics of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia to target the pro-western Saudi government - have left it to foreign residential areas, government buildings and facilities of the energy sector.
“This was a very great effort by the security forces over the last five months,” a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior told the state television.
The arrests also included a \"media cell\" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote \"Takfiri thought\" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims who are branded as unbelievers and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship located on a orbit shows that the planet is more like a distant twin of the Earth than ever before.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planet orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Billions of years ago, Venus had ruled conditions that would have been very similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But due to the unreinforced carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by sunlight and a slower rotational rate, Venus entered a completely different development course.
Today the planet is robbed of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is ravaged by hurricane strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express spacecraft of the European Space Agency, which examined the plants for a year, offer a sobering look at how the Earth could develop in view of the catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the Directors of Venus Express Mission, said: “It’s clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar.”
“Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago, perhaps with a habitable environment,” he said.
\"Enriched uranium\" seized by police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesperson said three people were arrested and the material was checked.
He did not confirm whether it was the enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
All still open
Mitt Romey said he didn’t consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican candidate finally agreed to hold a debate on YouTube, where normal voters take questions on video and submit them to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman who questioned Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican Party that breaks into the elections next year.
It is not known exactly how the producers of CNN who supported the debate selected the YouTube Clips to show the candidate.
However, in the first half of the debate, the longest one dedicated to a single topic, immigration was at the center of the debate.
The theme is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undisputed voters to serve an electorate when they heard things that they liked: The television station noticed peaks of consent when the candidates spoke strictly across the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who pushed ahead in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the reputation of having been postponing illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former Governor of Massachusetts of having hired illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two were particularly fierce as questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support an \"amnesty\" (the illegals would give regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Unsuspecting candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, succeeded in this issue.
None of the two men have serious chances of nominating, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have gotten earlier and harder than others on the immigration gap.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates share the same views in large and whole: sharper borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly brought to the fore as other issues were brought to the fore.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered a torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to believe that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, now opposed to all expectations in the first place in a recently conducted survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism, said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was forced to ask if Jesus would support them, he laughed about it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains extremely wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent donation success and his accident storms in Wednesday's debate.
These two were shot out of nothing because the two wings of the party had not yet been able to join one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party from the beginning and convincingly united with a victorious message about the size of America and a twin core to both wings of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
The Labour Party's Pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to invade; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly clever.
No noble title seems to be sold, no politicians pay Paris hotel bills, no extraterrestrial toes have been claimed.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has spent more than $650,000 (1.3 million) on behalf of the British ruling Labour Party for over four years, and that the party has failed to report this, is something without which the controversial Gordon Brown would have come out well.
When two months ago the Prime Minister withdrew the demand for an election, in a foolish way insulting Britain's intelligence by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, like Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once-fearing Brown developed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unskilled rescue of Northern Rock, a beaten bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment ability under committee.
Poorly thought-provoking proposals on the amendment of tax laws have raised corporate associations against the government.
The tax loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative spills.
A trio of generals in retirement started a riot in the upper house from protest against cuts in military spending: to be Minister of the Armed Forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the various donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary-General (and her former manager of performance) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown will stop irrevocably towards resignation.
However, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel impossible to rule.
Neither do people like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their scepticism when a new army takes office.
Once it’s clear that it’s unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he doesn’t even need to be there for a long time, this shift is over: the public service is beginning to become unsightly; the cabinet minister is starting to plausate; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is going to be defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new creature.
So he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax liability documents, for example, are related to decisions that Brown made as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it was not directly involved in Blair's mis-skill - as in the long-term state of noble title - the voters may assume that it was.
However, Brown's situation is not as bad as it looks
The mistakes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one has died, or has been completely suffocated.
And the opposite, painful as it may be, is what Brown’s natural Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and easily brutal government.
The new fund for political donations is a good example.
The Garboeske Abraham, who compares his donations with his nonprofit gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his goodwill.
This might be the case, but the decision did not allow him to do so.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he had known of Abraham's agreement, but not that she is illegal, will naturally have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main funder, who was told about the extraordinary donations in October.
However, Brown has not yet been involved: There is nothing to suggest that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his office takeover in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered this determination by grabbing a known instrument, an investigation committee on the subject - led to the completion of the measure, by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, “the lessons to be drawn out” are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it is a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, how to find a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and progressing with an ongoing reform of political parties.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a partymate like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some political facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear leadership in the opinion polls; he has two years to regain voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through irresistible justice and solid competence.
Cardhaie
Is the credit crisis in America’s credit card market?
If blood is in the water, it is only natural that back wounds stir up.
Now that America's real estate market is crippling, the predators have the country's credit card market in sight.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of infection spread from under-financed loans to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of the tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the bookings and the pool rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not inductable or more than 30 days too late.
The HSBC has announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its US consumer funding, partly due to the weakness of credit card owners.
It is still too early to fall into panic.
Loss and loss are still low.
According to the ECB rating agency, the third-quarters pool rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
An amendment to the U.S. Private Insolvence Laws in 2005 led to an suspended case of bankruptcy applications, which in turn account for much of the card losses; the number of registrations (and thus, payment fees) would rise again, whether or not the general conditions for creditors worsen or not.
The industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of their debts consumers pay off each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other areas of structured funding.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, calculated that the spending rates for 2007 will be at least 25% higher than last year.
Direct infectious channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: it is more likely that consumers will take credit card debt, now that home loans dry out.
However, the card exchanger looks at the cash flow rather than capital values, which is why falling home prices do not necessarily cause a change in the creditworthiness of the lender.
You can even be of benefit to the card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates will decrease if the property is less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, the card debt will be more important under the refund priorities.
Card distributors can also respond much faster and more flexible than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should dramatically reduce the risk of a rapid re-estimation of assets.
“We will not one day wake up and fully reassess the loan,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial representative.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of sustainable decline are much more real.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more gratifying future.
Keep looking at these sharks.
British bankers confess guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be brought before the court for their role in the fraudulent system with the former chief financial manager of Enron, Andrew Fastow, turned their requests into guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew had originally filed for seven cases of fraud using telecommunication to conspire with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer, on innocent grounds.
The procedure was launched in January.
But during a hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded for a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the United Kingdom for two years.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The allegations originally filed against them in 2002 made Fastov aware that he was the target of an investigation of the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The banker’s charge, called the NatWest Three, claims to have come to Houston in 2000 to raise a fraudulent business with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron, which was controlled by Fastov, who was the architect of numerous fraudulent Enron machinings that helped to tear the company into the bankruptcy truce.
In early 2002, the bank valued its share in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid $150,000 for a share in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow falsifies Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its share in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastov and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, copper and other $112.3 million, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastov found himself guilty in two charges of conspiracy for his role in the Enrons Pleite.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastov faces a 6-year prison sentence in Louisiana Federal Prison.
Kopper sits down a three-year sentence and a month in an institution in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on free foot on the basis of a $1 million bail, which made it necessary for them to live in the United States in expectation of the court trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the nation, broke up in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer make the billions of debt veiled or weakening companies seem profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Schilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with Enron's collapse.
Schilling has a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lays convicted of conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were eliminated after dying of heart disease last year.
Not quite down in Moscow
The price of an aircraft from the Gulfstream G550 brand equipped with a Rolls Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles is at least $44 million.
But that's small money for some of the rich Russians.
“It offers space for up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But none of you ask for so many seats because it’s for a private family or a corporate president.
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day orgy of the show's consumption, which was performed in a shackled exhibition center on the city edge of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition stands, hoping that new Russians would be interested in anything, from Mahagoni-made yachts to diamond-crossed car grilles that would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer cautiously took a bright orange Porsche to the next exhibition stand.
“This is a nice car, but it’s small money compared to us,” he said.
According to the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market.
Heated by an oil tree, the Russian capital seems to be flooded with money like Dallas at its shining times.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to enormous wealth and went to Europe, where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab Flyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear as the world's most generous money publishers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, has drawn up a conference to share ideas about how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who own a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived under the age of existence.)
\"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - so we're all here - said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
For the first time along with the Russian trader of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group, she visited the fair.
“The women are all exemplary caretakers and men are all worth a fortune.
As they go through the halls on Sunday night in evening clothing, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, identify themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Ms Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a Red Tippich veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed primarily aimed at the new areas, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers willing to stand for several hours in the barn to visit a busy warehouse, which appropriately placed Cadillac Escalades, bag knife from platinum, moat pick ice cream, custom-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically sat at a fair stand by Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a rembrandt image of hand-painted, blue mosaic stones.
“Usually, Russians are more interested in climber climber —
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years of age according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brands with limited numbers that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil betting here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with fitted gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, told a company the high-end cars equipped with high-end alarm systems that his company sold the gruesome orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer wishes, said he had sold three car cooler grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, the same chain arm tyres, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire that was developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a Rouliterad.
The cost: $22,000 for a four replacement.
“The Russian millionaire, who wants to have street leather wheels or a picture of his wife’s face from cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive on these wheels,” said Karapetian.
\"He will keep it in his 30s or 40s garage -
Even though many of its Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase “Russia millionaires” would not express much exclusiveity at present, given the rise in the so-called real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they probably already are millionaires, at least on the paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of those who believe than you do.”
Those who were not millionaires could do at least as if they were rich in a stand operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red phone cells according to British example, which were complete with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire trade fair.
Passengers stopped throwing around the money-hops, cell phone photos, while retaliating in the midst of the replacement wealth, cutting off friends, or simply inserting a few million.
“Look, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Mr. Karryev said.
Apologetic surgery suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the feast as Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as a nurse at the white Cape Cod held two doors further down at West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another.
“Then I saw the boxcar of the medical body viewer coming in,” said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
“That was the point when I knew someone had died.”
The hearings learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Dezernat.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure performed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who the police did not identify, and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Mrs Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations whose results may not be available for weeks will help to clear up a mysterious death that has sent a mourning through the lead of the Newark police.
Ms Arroyo was an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in the department.
“She was loyal, hard-working and stubborn,” Mr McCarthy said about Mrs Arroyo in a phone interview on Wednesday.
“She was my pit bull.
She protected me.
McCarthy said that Mrs Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the alcohol control commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized, surgical treatment.
“This is one of the possibilities,” said Mrs. Walsh.
\"It's an ongoing investigation.\"
The authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3 in the afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on site.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have reported little about their investigation or about the owner of the house listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say whether Mrs. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators try to determine if part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where an enchanted rose shrub stands in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatiner behind the house bells.
A blue barrel labeled \"Ethyl Vanillin\" - used as a replacement for vanilla in foods and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the lower floor.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him find himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this or that,’” he said.
“She was always here when I arrived and she was always here when I went.
It was embarrassing
Hopes that the central bank will reduce interest rates will lead to the rise of world stock markets
The shares sprang up on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets through further interest cuts, strengthened by critical comments from the vice president of the U.S. Central Bank.
The stock markets grew in London, New York and all over Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, president of the Central Bank, said that politics had to respond to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm sad markets, given the signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said recent turbulences had \"partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October.\"
If the increased turbulence persisted, it would increase the possibility of further strengthening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were received by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to enter and to stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into U.S. markets and possible further interest cuts.
The executions also helped calm the Wall Street, given other bad news from the U.S. economy, as sales of U.S. properties reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence have been stressed by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global employees, in a cost reduction measure to compensate for heavy losses from their lost bets in the U.S. mortgage credit sector.
Only 20 of these offices are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55%, to close at 13,289.40, while the wider-based S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany’s Index Dax rose by 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
In the past, the resumption of credit pressure on the markets had been emphasized after a significant 4.7 percent increase in demand for three-month warranty from the European Central Bank granted to the European Trade Banks, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank and other capital funds in London increased when the credit tensions saw the three-month-long libor rates of loan between UK Banks rise by 6.59 percent to its highest since late September, after a continuous increase since November 21.
England faced decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of which is almost as difficult as the other.
Who is to beat Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the electorate, on call at least under this special title, is here to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide on this, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filled with applications for national electorates, if not even for those in part-time.
Anyone who doesn’t always get the sixth beating position will be unhappy, but life is often unjust and sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to nail exactly what allows a person to reach the peak of his professional branches, while someone else never reaches the lowest rank, sometimes out of lack of luck rather than ability.
It is not just in the cricket, where selection is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise?
Is it fair to Shah when he does it?
The same may also be asked in another area, whether, for example, John Edwards or “Tubby” Banerjee, both intelligent young leaders should be promoted with good grades that know the business well.
Who can tell what the right class is for a cricket player unless it gives him the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, numbers have a big impact on decisions, but chances are.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a striker must get regular chances of order if he wants to impress as a one-day cricket player.
To catch the eyes of the electors is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who seems to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison explains himself to be healthy and how the wind conspires into the nets.
Anderson took 32 top-class wickets each with 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modest average, but both had their glistening points and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara is playing at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still struggling to strengthen himself, who created the breakthrough to a significant test cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion in the course of today’s network session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and affections for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his impressive and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 top-class hundreds and only six in Bopara, who is 22 years younger, and an excellent balance sheet against turned balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection of the electors as Vaughan was healthy to take his position back for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his beat, which was still publicized in Bombay.
In contrast, the All-Könner from Essex has fun of life.
He was impressed by nothing on a cricket spot and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he had recently crossed a four-wheeled vehicle in an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was get his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) out and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched it from a distance, and excitedly said, “Have you seen that?”
Bopara is a much better field player, he cones his middle pace with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit it and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time.
Perhaps this is the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah might not be there well if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus charges of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of distributors running out of money or visas, and others hoping the city would return to normality.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operating with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now.”
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people,” he said, with regard to the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces back at the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the vast Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called on him to tell him that a local U.S.-supported militia had helped to drive Al-Qaida out of her bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven out of his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after asking his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He had come back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaida militias in Sleikh and that they needed my support and the help of my boys.
That’s why I returned today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many have reported that they have been attracted by the increasing peace in the capital since the U.S. army's rise and the growth of local groups of affected citizens, who armed and defend their neighborhoods in cooperation with the American military.
But more were said to have been forced home by visa problems and wasteful funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had requested the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
“We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government forced the Iraqis not to give any more visas to force them to return to Iraq,” the Sunni pensioner said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left.”
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnits were displaced from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions left behind.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will cause sectarian tensions and conflict.
SmallSaarland, Good Education
The smallest federal country is leading in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education, the nation ofSaar is pushing the same deficit as the rest of the country.
\"I've been to a non-saar country for the 50th time yesterday that we're not French - this slogan places the smallest federal country self-ironically on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in theSaarland education system, which is placed in fifth place in the educational monitor of the Institute of the German Economy of Cologne (IW).
In this way, the universities work closely with neighboring countries from tradition.
The University in Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the share of foreign students with 15.6 percent is high.
However, even the country children bring the nation’s nation to higher education in an average number - many of them without a degree in high school.
“In the nation, we use the professional education system,” says Axel Plunnecke, an IW education expert.
More than every fifth youth acquires his degree at a vocational school, which means that the nation is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination possibilities of professional and academic training are also comparatively strong.
Rated at the population level, the equipment with dual courses is the second best in Germany.
Despite the practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has dropped by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering professionals.
“At the general schools, after the first Pisa study, we launched a number of reforms,” said a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
This is how the government has carried out nationwide comparison tests.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that is now also copying other federal countries.
Whether students’ performances will improve permanently will show future comparison studies.
In Pisa 2003, the proportion of risk periods shrinked from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, the Sahara did not rise as strongly as other federal states did.
The Bavarians expect better.
And for the confusion of the Saarlanders, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area one could point otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbors is compulsory to gymnasium - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez turns the clocks around
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon be different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez returned the timepiece in the South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
According to a new law, the clocks are set at world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that there is no other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez justified his decision, among other things, that the United States of the world had imposed the division into time zones for hours.
In addition, on Wednesday, Chávez announced the cancellation of relations with neighboring Colombia due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said as long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe president of Colombia remained, he will not maintain relations with either the head of state or with the Colombian government.
“I can’t do this alone because of my dignity,” said Chávez, who is driving a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The cause of the dispute was the decision by Uribes to withdraw Chávez from the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which involved the release of hostages.
Uribe criticized Venezuela with his decision to “face” Chávez on Sunday.
Also in Spain, Chávez is in all mouths.
In the country, a new mobile phone-klingelton provides for Furore: “Por qué no te callas” (Why don’t you hold your mouth) is the phrase that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the internet.
He spoke to Spain’s King Juan Carlos, who was nervous at the recent Ibero-American summit of the constant intercalls of the left-wing populist and was driven over the mouth.
German threatens 2007 payminus
In spite of the strong economy, German workers threaten a forecast this year with a real-world loss.
Experts called a whole bundle of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, the employees could actually expect less on the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
“Should this be the modest wage development, the increase in slavery and the price of food and energy,” said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the “Image” newspaper.
New burdens could also be applied to workers in the case of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said “New Osnabrück newspaper” the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent of the annual change is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Agency for Labour would not be able to come back to shame to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products has driven the inflation rate to the highest level for 13 years.
Prices rose by 3.0 percent throughout the year.
Venus is Earth’s Holish Twin
In spite of its life-threatening atmosphere, Venus is more similar to what it has been thought to be: The European space probe Venus Express has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind worms in Poland, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that it flashes on Venus.
Now the European probe ‘Venus Express’ has produced evidence - it detects electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the flashes on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from Cloud to Cloud, Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine ‘Nature’
According to the famous Ursuppen theory, lightnings have created life on Earth: thunderstorms are supposed to stimulate reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If there ever was life there, it must have been in the very early history,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there may be little more vivid on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times closer than on Earth, it reigns below temperatures of 500 degrees.
“The Venus is perhaps the devil’s will for the earth, but it’s a twin,” Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has so much different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of \"Venus Express\" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the early 1990s no longer had a probe of its own to explore this planet.
The latest research results, now presented in several \"natural\" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, according to researchers.
“They also show that the commons of our neighboring planet are greater than first accepted,” the Esa says.
In addition to the already known wind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud trudge at the South Pole, which turns even much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air currents on the Earth’s winter hemisphere, writes a research team around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Physics Cosmica.
The second tiniest planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits around the sun in almost 225 days.
However, it is much slower to turn around itself: an Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bars hardly remembers Earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
On both of these, water gathered on Earth remained in oceans, but on Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s view and has called for the major coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama reception.
“We should not present a split nation to the outside world in this question,” Köhler said.
At the same time, Köhler signalled understanding for the Dalai Lama reception by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity for me, even though I have respect for the diversity of cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knew that Germany had to maintain sensitive balance in foreign policy, emphasized the Federal President, but took Merkel in protection from the charge, they were running a new China policy.
“The Federal Chancellor has not distanced herself from traditional one-China policies.
China also knows that,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly shown impunity over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from rows of the Union.
Steinmeier, among other things, had complained about the Union's 'Schaus Committee Policy' in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lamas in the Chancellor's Office, there were fierce irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only invited German Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of Foreign Ministers of both countries, according to the information of the SPIEGEL.
China's Chief of Government Wen Jiabao has now asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to accept the Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China rejects it when European politicians officially receive the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao denied the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he was trying to split Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns of Krawallen as in France
Street battles with police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of Krawallen as in France.
It had to be done all that was necessary to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from getting into violence on the road, the Federal Minister of the Interior called for.
Barricades burned, Randaliers shot at the police with scrot flints: After the heavy youth collars in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar development in Germany.
“We must be careful not to build up our social explosives and release them into violence.
We have to take this seriously, he said, the “New Press” appearing in Hanover.
Not every young person comes to terms with the rapid change in social reality.
Federals, countries and municipalities were already working with emphasis on reducing problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
“From the integration summit to the Islam Conference, this is already the first success.
However, it is too early for warning.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that there are no urban and social problems in German suburbs as there are in France.
In northern suburbs of Paris, young people had delivered heavy street battles with the police in the past nights.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned.
The Federal Government called for greater integration efforts by the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the Krawalle in France, Colat warned of \"immediate effects\"
The situation in Germany is not as horrific as it is in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Colat pointed out that the unemployment rate in young people with migration background is “over average high” under 25 years of age.
In particular, more training places had to be provided.
Colat emphasized: “We have to give young people a perspective.
The chairman of the Turkish community, however, added that in Germany, more than in France, a social control takes place in the families.
Many young people with migration background also did not want to destroy what their parents had built up here.
Colat said, “But we still have to be careful.”
You have to give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training.
Meanwhile, it remained mostly quiet during the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in use, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a couple of burning garbage bins and cars.
Since the previous day, a bid of around 1000 security forces has been made to rest.
Police will go through as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced a visit to the suburb.
During the night on Tuesday, around 80 police officers were injured at Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel.
As a result, the riots took place on Toulouse.
The Krawalle was inflamed by a traffic accident in which two youths were killed on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
The Empire of Angela Wolke
The chancellor’s real-life appearance documents that the coalition is content to end — and that nothing can be expected of her.
In which country does this German chancellor live?
After their restless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was wretched and contented, one must say: not here - not in the country that had to be finally ruled by her.
The charge of focusing too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with an archetyping sentence.
This was Provincial, she said, and only showed that she does not want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, she has documented for all to know how much of her prejudice applies.
There was no concrete interest or feeling even a sense of the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a deposed politician who flees into foreign policy and remains in danger even there.
For example, climate protection: As it praises itself unbendingly for the decisions of St. Damm, but does not say how to achieve climate goals here.
At all times, the self-belief - so much indecently, the CDU-Chefin had failed two years ago.
Now, she emphasises on the floscles that the upsurge comes to people.
This will damage her image as a Pragmatician, who solves problems rather than make the world beautiful.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, internal political problems are a marginal appearance.
Children's poverty and the worries of low earners?
A few extras left her for it.
It is significant how often she promises when it comes to child abuse.
Three runs require Merkel to bring out a half-way straight set.
It stumbles like on a foreign terrain when it is concrete.
Department of Attack
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney deliver a hard hit exchange - and now have to fear an outside candidate.
The efforts of the candidates are already underway on the first topic.
He has made New York a “refuge for illegal immigrants,” Mitt Romney accuses his rival Rudy Giuliani.
On the one hand, this counters with severe accusations: “I would say that his own house was a port for Illegals,” Giuliani escapes and accuses the former Governor of Massachusetts of having employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: Because the Republican base continues to have no clear favorites, the eight presidential representatives use the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their opponent.
The self-rotated 30-second videos that Internet users have sent via YouTube are hardly more than the keyword.
“With this type of isolationism, we have allowed Hitler to come to power,” John McCain challenges his rival Ron Paul, who calls for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq as the only one in the round.
Romney also strongly receives the Levites from the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called Waterboarding, a method of interrogation that simulates drinking as a torture.
However, that the main issues of the campaign are beyond Iraq’s war and torture debates, show the response of the hall audience in St. Petersburg, Florida.
When conservative values are always praised and future tax increases are rejected, aside in the auditorium.
Once again, the weaknesses of the two favorites are shown.
“I was wrong at that time,” Romney explains, shouting in front of the base and television audience that he was still among the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to the blunder when he is asked in his opinion about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani commander Musharraf was defended as president.
This ended eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf has been honoured for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television overpowered the ceremony in the Presidential Palace of the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed his office as Army Chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thereby resisting international pressure from the United States.
Eight years after his conquest of power in an unbloody military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had met a core challenge of opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of exception that Musharraf had imposed on November 3.
Soon after his defense, Musharraf, according to Attorney-General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, will lift the state of exception and thus meet a further demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which had appointed Musharraf after the suspension of the exceptional state in early November with him, had rejected all allegations last week against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy and four more injured.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock return
Germany’s supergroup of the Sevenzigers again musics: The three band members of Harmonia took their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
The Revival is a part of their great time “Live 1974”
At that time, they were much more famous abroad.
The enchanted sensation then takes place in the form of three set men on the evening table.
Each has his box in front of himself, his cable and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius thrones in the blue-white shirt at 63 years of age in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is bent on the console.
Everyone contributes noise, including a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the Lords themselves.
The fact that the band remusicizes Harmonia has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
Here is where it is possible to reveal: Targeted demands revealed that the name was swung by collective pop memory, but not so sustainable to miss this band for 32 years painfully.
But why should the German not also celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
For example, what is called misleading scratch rock is more and more common in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the survivors of the Cologne Group Can 2003 the Echo Prize for Lifework, it was seen in the hall in asking German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Laudatio, the surprise knew no bounds.
At concerts, Michael Rother later hooked up at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage as an old club.
The problem of ignorance at home and the declaration in the stranger is one.
The memory has already been challenged with harmony because the trio only existed for two years and at this time also developed a much lower power of effect than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name cluster.
First played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at the power plant and then became a guitarist at Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians to exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruins, they lived as urban communities.
Less ideological than in the municipality of I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague himself as a child girl.
Formerly a top-of-the-art artist.
A stamp of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing club and a name for the art was also found in the lock.
Some hold on to harmony.
The first album was called “Music of Harmony” and the following “The Luxe”
Because so left and modest the music sounded as well, the band suffered material distress.
The rice collection did not serve alone for self-finding.
The CD “Live 1974” which was now released was included in a concert in Griessem, in front of a nearly 50-headed record cult, as someone believes to be.
From Rother came the desire to force harmony and exercise occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius, an innocent demand.
The band declared its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric-Spheric and secured his existence with albums such as “Flamming Hearts”
The cluster was revived in the 80s and has been more successful since then than it ever was.
The Greessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Their record company Greenland has set itself the goal of keeping the Krautrock as an authentic German contribution to live music.
New! has been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmony takes place in the Berlin House of Cultures of the World.
Publicly subsidized, within the framework of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and the author of the “Krautrock Sampler” manual.
There is also the love parade inventor Dr. Motte.
With this, the entire bandwidth of the influences of the Krautrock would be surrounded by the following pop music.
The empty spot of the supergroup is filled out by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s sentence, with the most unique sounds in the hall, reads: “The only true music, you belong to the future.”
There are pictures showing the producers with harmony in the farm tube.
Legend formation serves projections of further black and white photographs of wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are once again dealing with the improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the stroke to escape the instruments via self-inflicted effect devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the Technically Deeped Tufters.
This also does not change the choir of the house.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns, it is housed and winded under sound clouds and sang in a beautiful place with emphase — Aaaaaaaaah.
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in blues than in music high schools (can), technologies (power plant) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Those who call here — '68 — are not completely wrong, and harmony cannot be brought out of it even now.
The most natural thing is to take a deep look at the stage.
Where does music begin and when does it stop?
This can cause a person to steal the nerves or escape moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is not stupid enough.
\"The Hunting Party - and \"Morder's peace\" - are once again engaged in two films with the Balkan War.
But both do not believe.
Either the concepts are too much on action and balls or they are too rostery.
Richard Gere in The Hunting Party can’t help either.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans, but out there, in the dark back country of the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere has now been recovered.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because too many nice-interested roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on Buddhism drove out the desire for vision.
Now, Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, \"The Hunting Party - If the hunter becomes a hunter - (Why do movie titles have to actually be so long and we're more like Lokführer-Tariffs?).
He provides a wonderfully eye-catching portrayal: basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become if the fate and the film industry were not so beneficial: a man who has long been behind his best times, but who has preserved himself as a ruinous monument of his fall, yet much remains of the original charm.
But despite this Trumpfess, “The Hunting Party, along with German production “Morderic Peace” which also starts this week, continues only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
With \"Morderic Peace\" one can make a short process: The film is directed by two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who saves a Serbin from cosovary fences, where he is still in love with them.
Although it is welcome that once the Serbs are not represented as the sole root of all evils, the television-flated film loses too quickly in ball and action.
It remains a kind of “alarm for Cobra 11” without a highway but for this with war.
On the other hand, “The Hunting Party” is just an example of why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who are open to detect the Serbian top war criminal “the fox” might have become a new “Apocalypse Now” at another time with another director and another screenwriter (both in the Richard Shepard staff union).
Because the stories are like jaspering, both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something that the military cannot and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that one does not simply leave Simon Hunt to be the downtrodden Cynic with heart as he will be presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must, in addition, close him to a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, “The Hunting Party” goes down the stream when the reporters in the last five minutes in the time-consuming process succeed what Nato, CIA and all the world’s chief money hunters have failed in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians to just revenge.
This is so bad that one wants to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the Kinology.
The film has a deep human concern.
He wants to argue that Karadzic and Mladic are still running freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they are supposed to agree on at least once) not to engage in the persecution due to secret political agreements.
But the good-for-nothing and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous brecht poem comes to mind.
In it it says about the wood mask of an Asian demon on the poet’s work table: “I see compassionately the long-sleeved foreheads, indicating: how hard it is to be evil.
Movies like “The Hunting Party” have exactly such thresholds, but they indicate how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, in this newspaper, it has been reported that all Iraq films were Hollywood’s big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
Almost always: If a star drives around the world’s crisis-herds or minefields, something like “Rangoon” comes out with Patricia Arquette, “on the other side of the border” with Angelina Jolie or “Blutdiamants” with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are still too close in time.
It had to be decades before Hollywood was able to film a good movie about the Holocaust with “Shindler’s List”.
Some of the films will still be matured, which are now used as classic Vietnam works — The Deer Hunter — Apocalypse Now — or Full Metal Jackett — have not been celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today we know where every real-time mass murder comes home on two screens, even too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the screenwriters of the carelessness it needs to tell good stories.
“His or non-being, or “the great dictator,” eventually became so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin had not yet known how bad the Nazi regime really existed.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcasm-inspired artist's view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel “Lemprière’s Dictionary” and the Balkan War, he replied: “It is only because some things never change.
Large cities will always be horribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a gruesome way, and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia.
By Beust, criticism for Olympia absage
The mayor’s resignation from the application of Hamburg for Summer Olympics has been heavily criticized in politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the games at the water.
But from Beust’s point of view, realism is a factor in the assessment of opportunities.
The chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called a rejection on Wednesday as \"not good for the economic location\"
No other project has recently developed as great motivational forces in the city as the Olympiaidee.
\"Without this goal, the sport policy movement could not be maintained to the same extent.\"
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to kill the project, but to find a new long-term approach to \"getting out of a changed time beam\"
Mayor Ole von Beust remained with previous statements on Wednesday, according to which Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
“Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic competition, but the Deutsche Olympic Sport Federation,” said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the sport association’s decision to start December on an application for Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
“This preference means for us that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period we have been looking for until 2028.
However, the dream was not dreamed out for all time, said Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This will give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for Olympics over the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to build a chance by burying the plans at this time,” said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A rejection of the application also stands in opposition to the Senate Chief’s statement on the occasion of a reception to the General German University Sports Association’s full meeting.
Beust referred to the application of Hamburg for the 2015 Universiade, not as a replacement, for Olympics in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association first nominated Hamburg last week as an applicant city.
The SPD civil society group has accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
“The development of the Small Grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for many years because it has been placed on the Olympia map and knocked out the housing building,” said SPD commanders Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always requested integrated planning for the Small Grassbrook for Olympics and a later use of residence, the CDU has set a one-sided view of the “Event factor”.
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg had caused a great deal of excitement at the time.
Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes.
Those who link the terms Sweden and wood box think of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At present, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
Most of the four-and-a-half glasses listed there from the Stockholm type are included.
After a few months of doubting the authenticity of Andy Warhol’s Brillo boxes of 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now comes to a sobering conclusion: The six “Brillo Boxes” that the former Museum Director Pontus Hultén awarded the Moderna Museet in 1995 are copies — and probably the majority of the around one hundred other Brillo boxes of Stockholm type — that are in circulation in the international art market.
The prehistory is shackled, a confusing chain of artistic and curatoric productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first “Brillo Boxes” in New York City, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the paperboards of the soap powder “Brillo”.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - featured hundreds of Brillo boxes from paper: these were not from Warhol (for cost reasons) but were delivered directly from the Brillo Cartoon Age factory.
It was not art works, but their examples, just exhibition pieces.
At the same time, in 1968, Warhol granted permission to produce a few brillo box boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Newspapers now speak of around fifteen boxes, which were immediately entered into art and auction history as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes called \"Type Stockholm\".
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed it had been produced and exhibited around a hundred wooden boxes in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were only produced in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At the time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, has also examined three private properties of which two were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their press pan plates were first grounded and melted, after which white oil colour was applied with a brush.
On the other hand, the 1990s structure of the copies betrays that the color was applied directly to the press pan plate without base, not oil, but acrylic color.
\"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes - let the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, say: \"If the 'Andy Warhol Art authentication Board' in New York doesn't come to another conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibitation materials -
As early as July, the authentication Board announced the “heaviest allegations” that are being raised in terms of soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, there has been a silence there.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers gave up on a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He can't answer bloodshed, said leader Antonio Trillanes, who faces the President's corruption and election fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Government soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas use.
The two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to suddenly sit down with about 30 sympathisers.
The military police, who were supposed to actually guard him, apparently passed over to him and joined in his muttering.
They pushed into the Peninsula hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops shut down the district around the prominent hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People have enough,” Trillanes said.
“We call people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the Scout Rangers' elite unit, said other army units wanted to join the march in a short time.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the president for Friday.
Their government has been overestimated by corruption allegations for months.
Manilas Financirk was the main exhibition of the tried mercenary of around 200 military nationals against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours in the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.

In addition, the companies have included talks on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile products.
“We strengthen our partnership,” a United-Internet spokesperson explained.
The two companies have established the Community company MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
First of all, the two companies want to be content with a 10 percent share of Freenet and do not use their right to acquire another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all options open to further increase, particularly participation in Freenet AG.
Conversations between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
The poker around Freenet has been part of the consolidation of the German telecom market for months.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile phone contract customers at the end of the third quarter and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch so far held 6.01 percent of Freenet shares.
It has now been agreed that Drillish brings in about four percent more.
The right to buy 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
