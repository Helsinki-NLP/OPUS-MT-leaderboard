Fire extinguished at French chemical plant
The major fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished. The prefecture of Normandy announced on Friday. The fire had broken out during the night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with around 200 fire trucks.
The fire could be stopped.
Residents were urged not to leave their homes. Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work in the plant. The chemical plant has already made headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 the gas methanethiol escaped due to a leak and the environment smelled like rotten eggs. In 2015, around 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city’s wastewater system after an operational accident.
Woman quits her job to search for her missing dog for 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and quit her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had run away from the hotel room during a short holiday in Montana. 57 days lacked any trace of the bitch - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I was sick," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left dog Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel afterwards, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but to no avail.
Donner had panicked the dog
Hoping that Katie might still be at the hotel, Carole King went to the front desk. "The clerk says, "She left about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake." When the automatic front door opened, Katie immediately ran out. Presumably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But days turned into weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake" who quit her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man called in and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived, Katie had already disappeared. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch was standing under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King recalled loudly, "We had the whole car around us, and the tears were pouring out of her.
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, 27. September 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, the whereabouts are unclear. The opposition speaks of a "terrifying" extent.
In the Bundeswehr weapons and ammunition disappear again and again - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapon parts and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This is the result of a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, about which the editorial network Germany reports.
According to the paper from the office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon part and 3474 rounds of ammunition have so far reappeared. The weapons and weapon parts that still disappeared include six machine guns of type MG3, eleven rifles of type G3, four rifles of type G36, six signal guns and two pistols of type P8.
The extent of the loss of weapons and ammunition in the Bundeswehr was "terrifying", said Martina Renner, member of the Left German Bundestag. This was all the more true, since hardly anything had been found in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a "poor balance", although Renner criticized the fact that the investigation was not recognisable by A against the munition.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its arrest by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates was indicated as the destination port.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it initially remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company said that they wanted to wait for an official notification from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was accused on July 19 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz of violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary arrest of an Iranian oil tanker off the British-owned Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Merkel pays tribute to the courage of the people in the Peaceful Revolution
Chancellor Angela Merkel has paid tribute to the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken up the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU faction on the upcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt.
Musk sets extradition record
Tesla’s quarter may hold a record, but despite the delivery boom, there were losses at the electric car company.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost in the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it said in Musk's circular. The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to the customers. To do this, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked it: Tesla shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased that much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars, reaching its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-figure figures must be produced in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, there were losses recently.
Mystery solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found this out with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on the question of why children so violently resist the tickling, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the mere approach of a tickling hand triggers laughter even before the touch, due to a low-lying layer in the cerebrum, which already triggers laughter when the tickling is expected.
Previous research has shown that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound range when tickled by humans, and this "laughter" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touching
Until now, it had been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touching and touch by others - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found out in the experiments on the rats that laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-touching impulse. However, this is also the case if the living beings themselves are cleaning themselves.
If, however, self-touching and contact by others happen at the same time, laughter is also suppressed, suggesting that the rat’s brain cannot distinguish between self-touching and contact by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because self-touching activates a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. In the experiment, they sometimes stopped this initiation prematurely, showed flight behavior or fright rigidity. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of the tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: Large-scale fire in French chemical plant extinguished
The major fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered particularly dangerous, has been extinguished. The Prefecture of Normandy told the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire had broken out during the night to Thursday.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances have been released. The samples taken give no reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with around 200 fire trucks.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were urged not to leave their homes, with buildings within 500 meters of the building being evacuated, schools and kindergartens being closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticised by his own sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at the first session of parliament after the suspension of the compulsory recess on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to take the country out of the EU on October 31 without an agreement if Brussels does not accept his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
Speaking about Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the prime minister said: "The best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and to reunite this country would be to leave the EU." Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum campaign in 2016.
Memorial to the Oslo and Utöya attacks is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honor of the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (English: the Iron Roses) consists of around 1,000 iron rose replicas, reminiscent of the roses that had been deposited by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
At the same place, the project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will be unveiled - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected to open the exhibition.
On 22 July 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first detonated a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and subsequently shot dozens of participants in a youth camp of the Social Democratic Workers’ Party’s youth organisation on the island of Utöya, killing a total of 77 people in the attacks.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" detained in Iran has been able to set sail again. It could be a piece of the puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Rouhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been detained in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
"Stena Impero has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations," said Erik H<0xC3><0xA5>nell, head of the shipping company. "It's nice that it's over," he told Swedish TV station SVT.
“This is part of a pattern of attempts to interfere with the freedom of the seas, and we are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law,” the statement said.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had arrested the tanker on July 19 on the charge of having violated regulations of the Persian Gulf sea law. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well, according to the circumstances, said H<0xC3><0xA5>nell. They would have behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and exhausting situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now quickly working with their families on it.
The British government suspected that the arrest of the "Stena Impero" was a reaction to a similar incident in Gibraltar, where a supertanker with oil from Iran, which is said to have been destined for Syria, had been chained at the beginning of July. The delivery violated EU sanctions against the war-torn country Syria, according to the authorities. The reference to the ship had been received by the United States.
Iran called it "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Allegations that it was an exchange deal to get the "Stena Impero" released, London vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world’s oil exports are shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington lies the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the US had single-handedly exited the international nuclear agreement that was supposed to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb while at the same time ending its political and economic isolation. The US government has been pushing back the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and further incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz to the UN General Assembly in New York, calling on Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protection powers, to ensure the safety of navigation in the Persian Gulf with the “Coalition of Hope” for the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to be a "war profiteer". Given the punitive tariffs that America's President Donald Trump imposes on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to relocate. Financial chiefs of Asian companies, who are considering moving their production from China to another country, seem to call India's domestic market a significant one as one of the preferred alternatives.
But now India itself has come into Trump’s focus. Derogating from the White House haudogen as the “Kingdom of Customs”, America has withdrawn from the emerging country at the beginning of June the trade concessions for 2000 products. The US accuse India of prohibitively high tariffs and demand better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of the trade wars, the frictions with India are merely a sideshow. In addition, America sees the world's largest democracy also through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combines the concern about China's claims for power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salvo of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just taken a second five-year term in office, therefore, has a second five-year security.
The problem, however, lies in a different place: The empirically substantiated thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult position in the socialist republic of India. Also under Modi. His zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic insanity, which in the multi-ethnic state all too long suffocates any entrepreneurial spirit. Companies now receive faster construction permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has changed for the better in India in the first five modes. But this is not the case in trade policy. Inspired by protecting internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even built new barriers.
In the West, Modi is attached to the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At its core, however, the "India First" lawyer never moved away from a protectionist economic policy, which, thanks to the fact that the Indian companies are forced to become anachronistic, the country's political elites.
Jacques Chirac's funeral in Paris on Monday
Former French President Jacques Chirac is expected to be buried in Paris next week, according to a report. The former head of state will be buried on Monday in the cemetery Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, reported the news agency AFP, citing the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in a close family circle. A public funeral was scheduled for Sunday in the Paris Dome of the Invalides, according to media reports.
Taken to the finish line: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championships
The top of the world was already in the finish line when heart-warming scenes took place in the cooled down Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to wave dangerously. He could barely keep himself on his feet a good 300 meters before the finish, ran in an unhealthy stooped position, as Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau had not been able to stop him.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists. Shy at first, he did not want to talk at all about his heroic deed. After all, he wanted to set his personal best and when he had realized that this would be difficult, he would have to run only for the world, he would be proud to be here.
He did this that evening with great emphasis - and much more intensively than he probably would have thought. Because this feat will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even let his competitor Busby take the lead in the finish and voluntarily took over the last place - by the way a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead because of it. In the end it had used everything nothing, because the only with a lot of help came into the finish.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, started to set a personal best at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this succeeded with 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was under 18 minutes before". However, only in practice, best times do not count.
Million Mash: Egyptians prepare for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up ahead of possible anti-government protests. In the center of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several metro stations remained closed, streets around central Tahrir Square were closed.
Already in recent days, police had stepped up their roadside checks and partially searched pedestrians’ phones for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested, according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. They were also directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whom critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. There had not been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian sub-contractor living in exile in the Spanish city of Mansura brought a central role to the young Egyptian construction worker and actor Mohammed Ali, who has been in Facebook's rallies.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to rise, according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures were not independently confirmed at first. The government also did not confirm and comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were "arbitrarily arrested" "just because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time'," HRW said, citing lawyers. According to their lawyers, the allegations against the detainees range from "spreading false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, HR officials also questioned and searched security forces in uniform.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country, according to which the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: mail order retailers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the trash. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury Department has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies cannot be exempted from the sales tax on donations in kind, the ministry said on a question of the Green parliamentary group, which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday, but the dealers could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens send back every sixth parcel when ordering online. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - then ended up in the trash. According to the current legal situation, donating them would cost the companies additional money, because the financial authorities assess donations in kind as a turnover, which is then subject to sales tax.
Green Party leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies can evaluate non-sellable products accordingly and donate them free of charge to non-profit organizations. The companies would have to be able to rely on not to be punished for donating. This applies not only to online commerce, but also to other businesses from the fashion store to the construction market.
Banksy Art at Auction: There's Never Been a Better Time to Sell This Painting
Street art star Banksy's famous work, "Devolved Parliament", is due for auction soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underscores "the regression of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into animal and tribal attitudes." Starting Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is auctioned on October 3, estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the south-west of the UK, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had the painting on display again - coinciding with the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Time", was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change owners for a million dollars.
Last Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at the first session of the House of Commons, after the suspension of a mandatory pause imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court, engaged in a hard-fought exchange with the opposition. Johnson wants to carry out the Brexit, which has already been postponed twice on October 31, if necessary, even without an agreement with the EU.
This is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in the south-east of England, he painted a picture depicting a man breaking a star of the European flag with a chisel. The plant sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the United Kingdom every day.
Brexit debate is like a ‘walk in the park’
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's violent verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the election campaign before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book launch. "We enjoy this. We will leave (from the EU) and we will win."
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days, accusing them of, among other things, "treason" to the people. Allegations that he could put MPs in danger because they could be the target of death threats, he dismissed as "humbug".
Cummings said the only way to return to calm was for MPs to finally respect Britain’s decision to leave the EU, not surprisingly people were upset that Britain had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called on Friday for restraint. "We should talk to each other with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, in his first appearance before the UN General Assembly, has once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN general debate in New York. "If this goes badly, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst". The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented that."
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each control a part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. In early August, India withdrew the Indian Kashmir region from autonomy status and thus suddenly increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is reacting hard to the current protests in Egypt. It shoots at the population with live ammunition, more than 2000 detainees join the 60,000 political prisoners who are already there in the prisons. Protesting has never been safe in Egypt. But since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013, the state apparatus has been doing everything possible to avoid a springtime scenario.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions onto the streets. And this is a problem that even the regime of el-Sisi does not get under control, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, one in three in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has also lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, must decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression, but also the largest economic actor in Egypt. The military has a lot of people to do with. The water has a lot of people to do with it, the streets, houses, football stadiums, was producing food and much more.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER boss: No more "showstoppers" for capital airport
For two months, it was checked whether the complicated network of plants in the BER fire protection system works in combination. The operators are satisfied with the progress. But Tüv is not yet ready at BER.
After large-scale Tüv inspections in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year, which is certain, said Chairman of the Supervisory Board Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there are still shortcomings to work on in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we do not have a real show stopper", he assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve is no longer likely to be too large. The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the building authority in the course of the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of defects in power cables have yet to be rectified; Tüv will continue to check them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations here, intensive work must continue to be done on the processing of the defects," it said in a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all plugs on which the cable routes are attached. The airport chief expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not work satisfactorily yet. The problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons, which in the event of a fire like a screen, so that the smoke does not spread. They go down too far. 36 engines therefore have to be replaced. Then at the beginning of the year there should be new experiments with hot gas smoke.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have been delaying the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was supposed to go into operation in 2011. Since construction began in 2006, the costs have increased from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros expected to open next year.
As the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the authorities are planning to expand the airport, which is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board is to take place on October 18, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Chief Financial Officer Heike Fölster will join Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, and Chief Human Resources Officer Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She had set the airport finances on firm foot.
Chemnitz: vending machines for drugs blown up - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and blew up several vending machines in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in prison!
In the past two years, the number of blown up cigarette and parking ticket vending machines in Chemnitz and the region had risen sharply.
After two detonations at the end of May, the police arrested a 33-year-old German on Bürgerstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and on Further Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation for the bringing about of explosive explosions in unit of fact with particularly serious case of theft led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old confirmed".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed to a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "He apparently financed his addiction to narcotics with the loot", but the bomber blew up parking ticket machines on Bürgerstra<0xC3><0x9F>e four times between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60,000 euros!
The vending machine bomber is now in pre-trial detention, and police are continuing to investigate him.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further automata explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is changing its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price war with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA "takes over the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed a press spokesman of Austrian Airlines to the APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported about it.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings will thus be de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four will remain in Vienna. From January 2020, the AUA will take over this in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and the network planning, the spokesman said. The flight times will be coordinated with connecting flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other hand, to expand decentralized traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "Production Company" for the Group's sister company AUA. Among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be served with an AUA flight number, but mainly with a Eurowings device. The on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. The Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number 3 will not be as in the report, according to the Eurowings Terminal 1.
A price war broke out at Vienna Airport after the Niki bankruptcy. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced on Thursday, the fleet in Vienna next summer to increase to 16 aircraft. The Irish low-cost airline sends four Ryanair machines with crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the union criticized as a circumvention of the collective agreement.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary’s announcement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, said on Friday: “We will remain the number one at the location, in five, six or ten years.”
Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were best friends. Now the last of the four is married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped in the Italy holidays earlier this month for the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31).
“We are extremely excited to announce our engagement, we are both so excited to embark on this adventure together and can’t wait to actually be married,” the couple, who have been dating since October 2018, said in the official statement.
We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the years to come, full of love and happiness.”
Sister Eugenie took the pictures
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and published on her Instagram account.
A Royal Celebration
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information on date, location and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
What is certain, however, is that the marriage of the number nine of the British succession and the real estate mogul will be a similar celebration to the wedding of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers a heart failure or an infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the genome of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the genome of 9,000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Hochgebirgsklinik Davos, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diets are among the main influencing risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known, it said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genome of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at the UKE.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known to cause possible disease-causing changes in DNA, so-called mutations, the hospital said.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the research of other common diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New findings on the interaction between the heart and brain, heart and kidney, and cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne, 82, also emphasized that there is a firm will to use the data for research into other diseases. The clinic of the foundation in Davos has so far mainly treated allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be created on the local medical campus and a professorship for bioinformatics is to be created in front of the heart.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world, according to the hospital. In the genome decryption, strict attention is paid to the protection of the anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is about one petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, said Holger Moch from the University of Zurich.
According to UKE, the genetic material of a human being can be decoded within 24 hours today. The pure material costs for this are 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, have cost several hundred million euros. The study is expected to start on 1 October, and all 9,000 samples are already to be analyzed at the end of 2020. The following year, initial results are expected.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the still underage victims, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were mistreated. Some of them said they had been raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys had been detained under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. In fact, the protégés had been detained by their teachers in "most degrading and inhumane conditions," Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, had been chained in a small room.
The Koranic school has been in existence for about ten years, according to the information. Residents had alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents had been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koranic school, said Sabo. They had no idea of the sufferings of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested, according to police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee agency, therefore, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border into the neighboring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Nigerian police release 400 children from school after being chained and tortured
“Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries indicating torture,” police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said in Kaduna, Nigeria.
On Thursday, the children were discovered in an Islamic school, where conditions were "inhumane". The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held as slaves and chained at their school. Some were sexually abused. Television images showed emaciated and injured students in a noticeably poor state of health.
World football election: Further accusations after Messi and Klopp's freestyle
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Cup honours the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year, and for Lionel Messi it is the sixth honour and thus a record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, accusations from other countries come to FIFA. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious reason.
Much of FIFA has proven to be infamous in recent years: the World Cup awards, the dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Footballer election has so far not been suspected of being an objective vote - if one refrains from the fact that the voting national coach and national team captainship often after membership.
But after Nicaragua’s captain complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies now emerge: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
FIFA apologizes that "the signatures on the electoral forms were given in capital letters and therefore not valid" and has contacted the Egyptian federation several times to clarify the situation - without a reply.
Sudan's coach also surprised
There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese federation states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote in the way it was finally rated: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk on second and Sadio Mané on third. According to Fifa, the vote was also received in the same way, with signatures from the sudan.
Nicaragua’s captain Juan Barrera said in a statement: “I didn’t vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the details on my vote are wrong, thank you,” he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
On Friday, the association reported that it was true, but of course it had no intention of doing so. The completed election documents were "incorrectly" marked with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it said in a statement by the association. The second captain Manuel Rosas was actually chosen. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," the official said.
The other cases have now been examined by FIFA in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process was externally supervised by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers.So long Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world football election - and Jürgen Klopp world coach of the year.
Ukraine Affair: Top Republicans Call for Official Investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have spoken out openly for an official investigation against U.S. President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said Vermont Republican Governor Phil Scott. "Where that leads from here will be determined by the facts that will be determined." He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking action on the president's behalf.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been watching Biden “for years.”
The Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair, only a few have indicated discomfort. Scott’s comments are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party, although the moderate governor of Virginia had already repeatedly opposed Trump’s policies, such as the loosening of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
"It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right course of action and the responsibility for Congress now is to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, formally have no say in the proceedings against Trump that will be decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. However, also first senators of the Republicans have spoken critically about the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber of parliament, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing to the U.S.
The affair could lead to the launch of impeachment proceedings against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment process. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could exert a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on an actual impeachment would fall in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US president has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the office.
Were torturers on board Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily for raping and murdering in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had illegally sailed with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board the port of Lampedusa. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austria's President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now, new serious accusations against Rackete are being made. Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps may have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects have been caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We can not rule this out, but we do not have any reliable information"
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - by repeated and constant physical violence," the statement said.
NGOs and aid organizations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They are coming without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is investigated."
Italy’s right-wing ex-Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk sets new delivery record for Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
“We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by industry blog Electrek.
The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it said in Musk's circular. The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to the customers. To do this, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked it: Tesla shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased that much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-figure figures must be produced in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are small here. Despite the boom, there were losses recently.
U.S. budget dispute: Just another bridge financing
The new fiscal year in the United States will begin on October 1 without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House on Thursday and decided on transitional funding until November 21.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase spending limits for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, the United States is once again facing the new fiscal year beginning on October 1 with no spending plans. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21. Without such a decision, the federal administration would have to shut down at midnight on Monday.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration will now be funded at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the 2019 financial year to end on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to reach a timely agreement on the 12 spending laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, for the time being, the federal administration cannot benefit from the spending framework extended for the new financial year from 1.3 trillion to 1.4 trillion dollars.
In the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, the Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have hardly any chances in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are hardly capable of a majority.
In the Senate, the Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion to build the wall, one of President Trump’s major priorities. The Democrats are interfering with the wall construction plans and their funding, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the wall construction had escalated as early as December 2018 and had escalated to a 35-day shutdown.
At the construction of the Wall, the ghosts separate
It is currently unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November. A shutdown is then also not excluded.
Against the background of the continuing inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated danger of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity. Proposal S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue the funding of the federal administration at the previous year’s level, prohibiting the travel activity of parliamentarians and withholding their wages until the new annual spending plans were in place.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination will also be open to single women and lesbians in the future. The Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill, according to which all women can benefit from in vitro insemination. This is expected to significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donation.
The bill still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that in the future, numerous "children without a father" could grow up. The French bishops' conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agn<0xC3><0xA8>s Buzyn defended as a "chance" for society. It depicts the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her, the cost of artificial insemination for all women should be covered by the social security.
Fertilization with sperm of dead husband further banned
By contrast, the National Assembly rejected by a narrow majority an amendment that would give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there have been cases in the past in which women in vain on the release of the sperm of a deceased person carried a fate.
Numerous members of President Emmanuel Macron’s ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) and members of the opposition, however, had called for artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow would be imposed a “double grief” if her desire to have children remained unfulfilled by the death of her husband.
The initiators of the now-failed amendment consider it unjust that a widow may in future be inseminated with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, in France, artificial insemination is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot conceive children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would remain prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - it is nevertheless often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: calls for air tax for universities are getting louder
There is a lot of flying going on at the universities. That’s why the country wants to have a climate tax paid there in the future. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under internal pressure.
The universities should also limit themselves when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschutte
The discussion about a climate tax on flights from universities and colleges, which was postponed before the summer break, is gaining momentum again. After the State Rectors' Conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding push from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities are arguing that the first statement of the university in Gründregen is necessary for a compensation of service flights.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen again
According to the intelligence service FSB, the arrested persons are said to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time, there was a change of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. But this time there were no injuries, it said.
Communist North Korea is suffering from a chronic food shortage, and North Korean fishermen have been on the move in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard is patrolling to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 squids confiscated
During the re-checks, 30,000 squids were discovered and confiscated on the boats, and according to three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and taken to Nakhodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia’s fisheries authority had not issued fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there this year, according to the media.
Georgi Martynov, head of the Association of Russian Fishing Enterprises in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, also recently complained about the high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia, which would also be used to retrieve small creatures from the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed.
In the future, only 18,000 will be left: the US lowers its asylum ceiling
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is taking a stand against protection seekers: as the State Department in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees will be further reduced. In the future, above all, threatened believers and Iraqis will receive asylum.
The U.S. government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the admission of new refugees once again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the U.S. State Department said. In the now almost expired marketing year, the limit is still at 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump’s administration has drastically reduced the willingness to accept asylum seekers from around the world over the past few years, with much higher admission limits under Barack Obama’s previous administration.
The target cap of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980, yet the State Department called the U.S. “the most remorseful and generous nation in history,” a phrase strongly reminiscent of the language used by the incumbent U.S. president.
Trump said that a "responsible approach" to refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help with reconstruction. He receives a lot of support from supporters for his tough course in migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
A big point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal off. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Zelenskyi affair and a possibly imminent impeachment process.
The U.S. government wants to focus on welcoming two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted for their faith, and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are in danger, as the statement from the State Department shows, while Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador will accept a maximum of 1,500 refugees.
The United States wants to ensure that people from this "northern triangle" of Central America in particular apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration on the US-southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former zoo of Buenos Aires to a sanctuary for apes in the United States at the request of the Argentinian judiciary. Sandra, born in Rostock Zoo in 1986, was granted the rights of a "non-human person" so her release is mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday evening by direct flight - however, not as a passenger, but in the cargo hold declared by Mr.
Since the 53-kilogram human monkey is not able to adapt to life in the wild, she is to live in the open enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", formerly pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before entering Florida, however, "Sandra" has to quarantine in the U.S. state of Sed County.
"Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen after her birth in Rostock, before moving to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" fundamental rights, initiated by animal rights activists in 2014, has helped to transform the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and educational center for the preservation of biodiversity is to be built there.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 metres in 46 minutes
Extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new hussars ride at the almost 3000 meter high Gro<0xC3><0x9F>e Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double bottom or other tools, the Swiss defeated the 550-metre-high north face of the Great Peak in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, a t-shirt and only supported by absolute freedom from dizziness, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds to climb, undercutting the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in free solo speed on four of the six most important northern European walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sporting goods manufacturer Nike recorded a significant increase in profit. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars (just under 1.3 billion euros) in the past quarter. This is 25 percent more than in the same period last year, as the group announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directly addresses its customers online.
Revenues rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period to the end of August, with Nike sales growing most strongly in China, up 22 percent. As a result, the Beaverton-based company in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited from its approach of targeting consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps in the People’s Republic.
Chief financial officer Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue to drive the sporting goods manufacturer’s “digital transformation” with strategic investments, enhancing its competitive advantage, and investors were pleased with the quarterly results – the sporting goods manufacturer’s shares increased by more than five percent.
Life-long stadium ban due to racism in Italy
Due to racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital imposed a lifetime stadium ban on a fan. The Brazilian defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram in 2016. Jesus then published the private messages and asked his club to take action. "<0x40>officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan.
The club responded late Thursday. He had reported the fan's account to Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma-follower may never visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," Fifa president Gianni Infantino said last weekend. The occasion of the statement was racist chants between the first league and the A.C.C.
The Italian authorities have now imposed 38 rioting stadium bans on fans of record champions Juventus Turin. Four of them are no longer allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said. The rest are subject to bans of four to seven years.
Fans have been linked to an ongoing investigation into 12 ultra-fan group leaders around Juventus, including those accused of serious extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club launched the investigation with an ad last year.
According to Italian media reports, the Ultra leaders are said to be behind the black market of tickets, they had "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and allegedly blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole vintages are given catchy names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the lifestyle of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" With this call, the crab fishing at Gucheng Lake in Gaochun officially started on September 21st, which also heralded the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "slow city" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "slow city" movement. The city has ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun, all around Gaochun, provides its inhabitants with conditions.
The people of Gaochun started raising crabs in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a formative industry that has provided high incomes and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has actively promoted the efficiency of large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming as well as a technology-based city-based crab farming.
In recent years, Gaochun has pushed ahead with a reform on "distribution of power, optimization of administration and government services" and has carefully built up the service network for "permissions under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network of services, a platform for lending" in order to fully optimize the environment for permits, for services and for development.
Gaochun takes advantage of the advantages given on the ground by the connection to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui to the full and uses the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a signpost to promote intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedical and medical technology, for energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sector and the state tourism.
Iran-US conflict: Rouhani speaks of end of sanctions - Trump disagrees
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani has returned to the UN General Assembly to speak of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions in exchange for talks with Tehran’s leadership to end all sanctions, Rouhani said on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no".
Ruhani describes the events as follows: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had insisted that a meeting take place. "And America says I lift the sanctions," added Ruhani. The kind of punitive measures that should be ended have been up for debate. "And they clearly said we lift all the sanctions."
However, Ruhani said that the move was not in an acceptable way, and given the punitive measures in place and the “poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure,” no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Rouhani in New York. The background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron had expressed, like Merkel on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, the hope that Rouhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After being shaken by two earthquakes in a very short time, the fear of disaster is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake on the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said the Turkish vice president Fuat Oktay on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged, according to the earthquake of magnitude 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul on Thursday, and panic in the metropolis. Now the government wants to use a commission to better prepare the country for future earthquakes, announced Oktay.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is ignored again and again. Every year, poorly built residential buildings collapse - among other things, mourned by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces, which were registered as refuges in the center, have long since been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August, the Istanbul Civil Engineering Chamber had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of Thursday’s quake was in the Sea of Marmara off the Silivri district and at a depth of about seven kilometers, according to the civil protection agency Afad, a smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that no injuries or damage had been reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings in the Silivri district for security reasons. Some students cried, as shown in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly earthquake-prone. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian fault, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the 1999 earthquake near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten, but when it comes to the earthquake is unclear. In the earthquake on Thursday, it already hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies are designing contingency plans, private individuals have so-called go-bags packed with all the necessities standing next to front doors, and schools are teaching children how to behave when the earth shakes.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom). According to the information, two minarets of mosques in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts collapsed.
Warning for aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. Buildings rocked. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than Tuesday, writes one user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Klinik, warned via Twitter about aftershocks. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The time of the quake is reported to be 13:59 (local time) and just a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was an aftershock, which was reported with a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt as far as Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Sea of Marmara west of the metropolis, the civil protection authority Afad said on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers believe that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul – the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge – and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It has become more likely, he told CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a bigger earthquake," Ersoy said. "Sooner or later, the big quake will also come."
Just a few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the quake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In Albania, there had only been a few days ago a violent earthquake - there were 68 injured. Also on Lake Constance, the earth had quaked this year.
Parliament: New Ignition in Ukraine Affair
Two explosive documents provide new fuel in the Ukraine affair about the possible abuse of power of US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment procedure, the US Democrats see themselves reinforced: The complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president is also important clues for the investigation against the president. Trump once again sees himself as a victim of a "wit".
United States: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - plane diverted
United Airlines rerouted a passenger into the boarding toilet, and the toilet door was blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, according to U.S. media.
During an unscheduled stopover on Wednesday night (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally freed from the narrow cabin. She had been locked in it for about an hour, wrote the US media, citing other passengers. To continue the flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the plane.
In a video posted on the Internet, which according to the US media is supposed to come from Flight 1554, you can see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We are currently working on opening the door, ma'am. We will get you out soon, okay?" says a man. The airline has apologized to all passengers. It was initially open whether the woman receives compensation.
The Cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous story “The Transformation”, the British successful author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "The Cockroach" (original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27th, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) informed. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who in his previous life was ignored or hated, but now he is no longer the most powerful man in Britain, he sees it as his mission, the will of the people is wild and determined to do it.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If parliament is closed so that the government can't be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers shamelessly lie like the Soviet leaders once did, if Brexiteers in high positions appeared outright to invoke the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to that: write."
First published in 1915, Kafka's story is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "transformed into a monstrous vermin", is gradually excluded from family and society and finally perishes.
EU invests €9.5 million in Austria’s rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary are fitted with whisper brakes to reduce noise pollution from freight trains, and sections of the rail links between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authority, this is to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled by October 31st
The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all trips until 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency application. Travels could “not be started for insolvency reasons”, the company said on Thursday evening.
Bookings by the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>GER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid for or fully paid for, were also affected. The company left open the issue of travel with the start of November 1, 2019.
Thomas Cook in Germany was in the wake of the bankruptcy of the British parent company and had filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>ger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to transfer money back to hotels from now on
On the other hand, as of this Friday, hotels abroad that currently still host Thomas Cook vacationers are to receive money from Zurich Insurance.The payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that vacationers are no longer asked to pay extra.
On the basis of the booking information and without presentation of separate invoices, the hotels in the holiday resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman for the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travelers from these hotels are not immediately requested or otherwise forced to pay individual hotel invoices," spokesman Bernd Engelien continued.
The insurance company reacted to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay for their accommodation on site, and some had to put more than 1,000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had sharply criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be agreed with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, said the insurance spokesman. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook package holidaymakers from Germany were still on the road. Zurich Germany has secured the holiday and return journey of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the now announced payouts to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travelers who are currently on the move. For Thomas Cook customers who want to fly on vacation, it looks bad. On late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips up to and including October 31 would be cancelled. This also applies to such bookings that have already been paid.
As far as travel with a start from 1 November 2019 is concerned, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said. Basically, the insurance Zurich is responsible for these cases. The sale of new trips is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. Customers can inform themselves on the Kaera website about possibilities of reimbursement of the travel price and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry Destroys Explosion Mine in Angola
Prince Harry has long been continuing Lady Diana’s commitment to Africa and is now following in his mother’s footsteps.
Dressed in a blue splinter vest, British Prince Harry has detonated and destroyed a blasting mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the village of Dirico, he made the firing circle on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosive device exploded in the savanna landscape without causing damage. Although alone the Halo Trust has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields threatening the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to walk directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana in the city of Huambo (1961-1997). With the same blasting master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to go the way she went then. The pictures, on which Princess Diana went through a cleared minefield in 1997, had gone around the world. She also had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a 10-day trip to Africa since Monday, which has started in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Brexit negotiations stall: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly agreed: With him there will certainly not be a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements are eternal with the polarizing British already. The recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Great Britain floats like a Damocles sword over the blond head. His case of the negotiations, in order to be able to carry out his Brexit course in October, the EU law to the withdrawal date, was always cancelled at the beginning of this week.
Boris Johnson says deal is possible
In the meantime, when visiting a hospital, Johnson hinted that in the event of a no-deal, he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best of all, with a deal, I'm cautiously optimistic that it will work.
And time is gradually running out for Brexit negotiators in Brussels. Around six weeks still the EU and the British negotiators have time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. But even the recent talks have not achieved a breakthrough again. An agreement until the end of October seems currently rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, then a renewed postponement of the withdrawal date could take effect. But the opposition trusts the words of the Prime Minister No.
U.S. government: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the U.S. has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injured in this context, the U.S. health authority informed CDC. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there have already been more than 900 affected, about 500 of them confirmed to date. The cause of the lung damage is still completely unclear in Europe.
The fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
The videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared millions of times in online networks. The Spanish-based developer and actor calls for a "people's revolution". For Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes to hold mass rallies with one million participants in central places of the country.
Security authorities have been alerted. In the centre of Cairo, an increased police presence has already been observed. Several metro stations have remained closed, roads around central Tahrir Square have been closed. Already in recent days, police have stepped up their road checks and partially searched pedestrians’ phones for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly to it. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested - just because they were sharing HR at the wrong time, in the wrong place.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country, according to which the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after toppling democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially convicted in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
Polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday and was greeted on his arrival at the Port of Hamburg by skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic with the racing yacht "Malizia".
Together with a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, the polar researcher said. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak out. It has been known for decades that the Earth is warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there was a planet B.
“What happens at sea often takes place to the exclusion of the public,” said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the littering of the seas. During the expedition, Greenland glacier ice was measured with a drone and fished with nets for microplastics, it said.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans", the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" at the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model," said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony.
Expensive Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 euros for pasta
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Castel Sant’Angelo in Rome: That seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 euros tip included was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," a spokesman for Federagit, the travel guide association in Rome, told the daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The owners of the restaurant responded promptly. The Japanese had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, justified the local owner. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. A tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is also normal, said the innkeeper.
U.S. President Donald Trump may actually face impeachment after the tumultuous revelations of the past few days, the Democrats now want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - we are talking about weeks until a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the phone call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The accusation of the whistleblower, who has brought the conversation out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the US with his complaint, is monstrous: the president has abused the power of his office to use the government of another country for political influence to the 2020 election.
The core of this project can also be traced in the transcript of the conversation with Zelenskyj, which has been published in the meantime, although it does not reproduce the full text. The telephone call of 25 July is only one episode of a much larger story, at the center of which, alongside Trump, stands his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the point of view of the public, the story begins in May 2019, when the New York Times reports of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine are very illegal. He wants to meet in Kiev with the just elected president Zelenskyi, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We are not interfering in an election, we are interfering in an investigation, which is very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, in, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump’s 2016 election opponent: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, to construct an occasion for the Russia investigation in the US, but this accusation was never serious.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will be talking about so prominently on the phone with Zelenskyj in July. The version of Giuliani and the president is: The former vice president and currently prospective candidate for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as Ukraine representative of the Obama administration on the dismissal of the then Ukrainian prosecutor general, had pushed the senior prosecutor of the Ukrainian gas company to him.
In fact, the process was a little different when Joe Biden called for the Ukrainian attorney general to leave, the investigation into the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin himself was also accused of deeply corrupt behavior, the US government was far from the only Western partner to press for his dismissal. Incidentally, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp Disruptions: Social Media is Down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, especially Germany, Great Britain and Spain are affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has not loaded since about 3:30 p.m. again and again. Instagram also gives the error message that content could not be loaded. Also Whatsapp seems to be affected by the disruption, although not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disruptions
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services had been down for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users this time mainly use Twitter to vent their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the ice of Antarctica by the Chilean Air Force. They were traveling in a rubber boat several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour it took the Chilean rescue helicopter for the rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the message, at just before ten we started, and a good 20 minutes later we were over the inflatable".
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Note: Smartphone NEVER charge wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come onto the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to call to mind a study from the beginning of July. Wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
The higher the temperature, the lower the temperature
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the much greater heat development. If a mobile phone is charged normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. With wireless charging, the researchers have measured the power consumption, even with perfect alignment of the smartphone on the charging pad. What, in turn, the temperature rises slightly next to the coil.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but it also does not last as long overall. So the service life is lower. The researchers therefore advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since a battery replacement with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, although this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently added a battery for all costs.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on an appropriate charging pad - these are now even already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable clutter and cumbersome plug-in fuss. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) is a worldwide standard, with the exception of which even Apple participates, there are hardly any restrictions, according to the technology.
Everest dam photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world in just six months, Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal, setting a record, his expedition organizer said.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He made international headlines once: from him comes a viral spring photo of mountaineers standing in line on Mount Everest.
The image of mass insurgency sparked a debate over stronger security measures on the 8,848-meter-high mountain and highest peak on Earth, with 11 climbers killed in May.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: At the moment, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As a reason for this, among other things, bad weather is mentioned. Earlier this week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wants to talk to China to allow him to climb.
Four elephants found dead in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous Sigiriya rock fortress, which was visited by many tourists. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously remained harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that there are only about 7,000 elephants left in Sri Lanka, and the death penalty is theoretically based on their killing.
British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its arrest by Iran, according to the Bandar Abbas Maritime Authority, according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had arrested the British-flagged tanker on July 19 on the charge of violating regulations of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in the Criticism
The responsible economic committee of the lower house wants to comprehensively investigate the bankruptcy of the travel giant Thomas Cook. It will be about the salary packages of the board as well as the question of why the British government would not want to financially support the company fighting for survival. "Our interest is the supervision in the company as well as the control by external accountants," the committee chairman Rachel Reeves said.
According to experts, genes are overestimated in colorectal cancer risk
The role of genes in the familial increased risk of colorectal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a recent study. Other risk factors such as familial dietary habits therefore probably weigh more heavily than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual colorectal cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk is raising Tesla shares
Musk wrote this in an email to Tesla employees on Thursday (local time) published by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it said in Musk's circular.
The challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly, with Tesla having to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased that much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars, reaching its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-figure figures must be produced in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, there were losses recently.
Will the UK government circumvent Brexit law? Johnson reluctant
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covering up whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the latest law passed by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit, but when asked on Friday, he said his government would abide by the law.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October, which Johnson criticizes as a “surrender law” that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use “political harassment” to circumvent the law, and that Johnson could use a procedural trick to delay the law’s entry into force until after the EU exits.
“We are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is with an agreement,” Johnson said.
Iran Is Increasing Its Uranium Enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased pressure on European contractors in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, European states show inability or unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions," Rouhani said on Thursday at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. In case they did not live up to their promises, he put "further steps" away from the agreements of the laborious 2015 deal.
Background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained the promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The US single-handedly exited the agreement in 2018 to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to change course in what is considered an aggressive Middle East policy. The government of President Donald Trump wants to renegotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions in Iran.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using, or at least has prepared, the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium. According to IAEA information, Iran is also preparing the construction of more than 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to carry their share of the deal, leaving the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of U.S. sanctions, Rouhani surmised, but there will still be more talks that will hopefully bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran’s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the mixed situation has changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Initially, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had confessed to the attack, which was considered a false confession by the US. "We have nothing to do with it," Rouhani reiterated on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations need to provide evidence," Rouhani said. However, European leaders in the talks with him during the UN General Debate could not. Instead, they would have relied only on the fact that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Johnson in recent days.
Rouhani demanded that the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration be lifted before possible talks with US President Trump. He called on the government in Washington to switch to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet from Another Star Crosses Solar System
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This was first achieved. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess has now been confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named after its discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The long-traveled comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in the Crimea - with a self-made telescope 65 centimeters in diameter. Follow-ups of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not originate from our solar system.
According to 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017, 2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object seen during a transit of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get close-up glimpses of an alien solar system before it disappears on Never Again. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands reported. "The current velocity of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which at this distance is well above the typical speed of the U.S.
The comet is, according to the analyses, on a so-called hyperbolic orbit, which leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was first identified by the name of the catalog number C/2019 Q4, received the designation of the second part of the BoI.
The astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been sighted, leaving the researchers many months to investigate. "The object will reach its maximum brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "After that, it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers in an initial study. Images from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers from the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de Le<0xC3><0xB3>n, who is a member of the team at the Institute of Astrophysics.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors in just two years indicates that these objects could open a new path for research into certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how frequent such visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could potentially intercept a planned satellite mission of the European space agency ESA.
By 2028, the agency intends to station the three-part Comet Interceptor spacecraft in a waiting position 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, which, according to ESA Science Director Günther Hasinger, will either be lurking on a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamu.
First landing at Beijing’s new mega-airport Daxing
Just in time for the 70th birthday of the People’s Republic of China, the time has come: At the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger plane of China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for the captain and crew.
The new airport is expected to handle around 45 million passengers annually by 2022 and 72 million by 2025. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project, while China’s latest prestige project is also called “Sea Star” due to its six-arm structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway will transport passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the since 2006 under construction - and much smaller - capital airport in Germany has been postponed again and again. In Beijing, on the other hand, after four years landed a first passenger plane.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: from London to Sydney in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - that's what the British space agency UK Space Agency dreams of. To make this flight, targeted for the 2030s at supersonic speed, a special propulsion (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company reaction engines from Oxfordshire are developing, the U.S. channel CNN could do the agency. "This is the technology that is definitely the turnock," said the agency.
In order to advance the project, the British space agency wants to work more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport, the Concorde from 1976 until the cessation of its operation in 2003 had covered the route New York-Paris space and for this, the last three to three and a half hours were used. In 2000, the U.S.S.A.A.A.A.A.R.R.R.R.A.R.R.R.R. also developed a plane, the Lockha-R.R.A.A.A.A.A.A.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," Reaction Engines writes on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere, thus enabling the "next generation of truly reusable road vehicles".
Riot in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tipsters in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power of the US President, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
“I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information,” Trump told U.S. staff at the U.N. Embassy in New York on Thursday. The person in question is almost “a spy” and has been dealt with “a little differently” in the past than today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate tipsters. The event was actually not public. However, several U.S. media broadcast audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the president’s statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives had announced on Tuesday preparations for an impeachment proceedings against Trump. Their allegations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official who makes serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. The descriptions of the whistleblower had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have received information from several government officials that the US president “uses the power of his office” to get another country to interfere in his favor in the 2020 US election.
At the heart of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate what could harm his political rival Joe Biden, the former business of Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine, and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to the Ukraine phone call: Leading government employees had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the covers. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been made. This was after the conversation at the instruction of lawyers from the White House, but roughly removed from a usually provided database and instead a specially protected system was stored.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it should be an employee of the foreign intelligence service CIA.
Trump again questioned the source’s credibility on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the “so-called whistleblower” had disseminated second-hand information that turned out to be inaccurate. So there may be no tippers or spies at all.
In New York, Trump’s comments about those who allegedly leaked information to the whistleblower sparked outrage, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reacted with dismay and lamented that Trump’s testimony once again undermined the integrity of the administration.
In the House of Representatives, various committees have been conducting investigations against Trump and his entourage for months. In view of the Ukraine accusations, the Democrats are now pushing ahead with new force to initiate a possible impeachment proceedings against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said House Intelligence Committee chief Adam Schiff. Trump sharply attacked Schiff, accusing him of misrepresenting things and again calling for the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insults Schiff and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government security and foreign policy officials, most of whom worked under Democratic and Republican presidents, backed the Democrats’ investigation into a possible impeachment case in a statement released on Friday, saying if the allegations prove true, it would be “an unscrupulous abuse of power” by Trump.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could indeed initiate a so-called impeachment procedure. The decision on an actual impeachment, however, would fall in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore small. So far, no US president has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the office.
VW works council: jobs are being "creepy" dismantled
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the works council of the car manufacturer around. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs of ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023. Of this, 500 million euros are to be saved as early as this year.
One key factor is personnel costs. The "Future Pact", negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016, already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. The principle applies: A job can only be reduced by the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, an employment guarantee until 2029 applies.
As our newspaper now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production that were not actually at the disposal are "creepy" cut off via another route - i.e. past the official course.
In these cases, the works council has no possibility of forcing the reoccupation. Meanwhile, in many places, there is a lack of personnel, the work compression is increasing, the worries about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle factories would be greater. This also increases the fear that the vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is more favorable in other parts of the world.
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and control new projects centrally. This is also intended to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - the goal is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. At a manager conference in Berlin, Andreas Tostmann, head of production, said: "Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the impending trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof."
For example, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle will fall compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, will be shortened by 1.1 hours. Exact figures on the production period are not provided by VW, according to our newspaper, it is around
20 hours.
In our region, the main plant in Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The plants in Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, the general rule of thumb is that 800,000 cars must be built there every year to make the plant profitable. In 2018, however, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the declining diesel demand and the new PLT.
As production director Tostmann announced last year, one million cars are to roll off the production line in Wolfsburg in a “perspective” way. This is intended to make it possible to bundle the Golf production in the main plant – because the Zwickau plant is handing over the Golf production through the conversion to a site for electric car production.
In addition, the Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) SUVs are being produced in Wolfsburg. However, sales of the Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations are now resting on the Golf 8.
Forced to Prostitution with Voodoo: Human Traffickers Sentenced
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn in, smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six suspected traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six alleged traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced on Friday in Bochum to probation and imprisonment of up to eight years and three months. The defendants had smuggled young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution. To force their obedience, the Nigerian women who wanted to leave had to make a ritual oath in front of a voodoo priest in their home country.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in inflatable boats. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. Once in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels in order to work off the alleged smuggler costs of an average of 25,000 euros. The wage was therefore completely taken away from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the introduction and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women to brothels in the trial. "The work made the women physically and psychologically difficult to cope with," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. "Some were really disgusted."
The verdicts are based on commercial and gang smuggling of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and heavy forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendants union UFO has once again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union "will inform on October 14 about the industrial action in the LH Group," said UFO tariff board member Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining negotiations with the UFO for months, including the question of whether the union has lawfully terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, UFO is now strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to establish that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and is examining to appeal. "That a second court sees the matter completely differently, I think it is unlikely," said UFO CEO Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa filed an application with the Frankfurt Labour Court to have the status of UFO as a trade union reviewed in court, arguing that the union had not appointed a representative board for months and was thus unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the sector trade union, during which many members of the board and the advisory board resigned, including long-time union leader Nicoley Baublies. The UFO had suspended an already begun vote on strikes by cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about its leadership.
Easier entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet, but that is now to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists with a new visa system in the future. By 2030, they want to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the tourism commission said.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access for tourists. Visas are usually granted only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes to more income from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
By mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the country’s most important oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churai oil field. As a result, national oil production plummeted dramatically, oil prices skyrocketed, and it should take several weeks for the kingdom’s oil production to return to its old levels.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are getting ready for their wedding
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in her Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time) showing her in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelorette party in Los Angeles, according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, banana-printed suits on Instagram, asking his followers, “Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding.” According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to get married churchly this coming weekend.
A year ago, the Biebers said yes to each other in a New York registry office, and there was no major celebration at that time.
In a recent interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey explained that the two had found a common ground after initial problems: “If you don’t want to compromise, you can’t have a relationship.”
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreckage was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Mechin), police said. The dead are a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
Authorities had been searching for the plane since Thursday evening, after the crew had issued an emergency signal via GPS. During the search, a military helicopter was also in use. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, non-residential species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also the causes of the threat, reported the World Conservation Union (IUCN) on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of the threat and thus facing extinction.
The IUCN categorizes endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "at risk", "strongly endangered", "threatened from extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct". In total, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
Mountain and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) are particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have been considered "at risk" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The greatest threat next to a fungus is the Balkan miner moth. It has been spreading since the 1980s from south-eastern Europe across the continent and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (aesculus in hippo) is less than in the continent.
Shrubs and mosses also at risk
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails play a key role in the recycling of birds and birds.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the Europe Office. "We must limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake off Istanbul: 34 injured
According to the latest earthquake in Turkey, 34 people have been injured. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged and nearly 200 aftershocks have occurred since the previous day. The 5.8 magnitude earthquake shook the Marmara region off Istanbul on Thursday, triggering panic in the metropolis.
Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes in the past 20 years, Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said, adding that Turkey has not been prepared for earthquakes in the past 20 years.
Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disturbance, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates.
One of the most severe quakes was a magnitude 7.6 quake near Istanbul in 1999. The epicenter was then in Gölcük, southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed.
Already on Tuesday, a magnitude 4.6 quake shook the region around Istanbul, and authorities called on residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the halftime show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the halftime show of the next American football final Super Bowl. The singers announced on Twitter. "It won't get any bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is insanely excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be in Miami so far.
Jennifer Lopez said she had been dreaming of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996, when she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the halftime show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina."
Shakira said in a statement that she is honored to be alongside another artist on one of the biggest stages in the world, representing Latinos and Latinas from the US and around the world, "and then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, it is the first time that the two "queens" stand together on one stage.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining viewership
The Super Bowl is the culmination of the American football season. The game and the halftime show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the United States. Even if you’ve recently seen a drop in viewership, this February the spectacle in the United States attracted the fewest viewers in more than a decade. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
There was an uproar about the halftime show of the last Super Bowl: In the dispute about the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, according to media reports, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the halftime show - the reviews were not friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had fallen to his knees in the 2016/17 season before NFL games at the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked him from the mostly African American football stars has not been sharp.
Cook bankruptcy: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to face the bankruptcy of the travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press report. There are high write-downs on outstanding bonds and loans. This also affects Credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit and Credit Suisse would have to write off a total of up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.8 billion (around €2 billion) on their books, according to estimates by consulting firm AlixPartners.
Creditors of bonds would have to accept amortizations of <0xC2><0xA3>900 million to <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion and lenders between <0xC2><0xA3>550 million and <0xC2><0xA3>825 million, while the actual amounts to be written off are more likely to be at the upper end of the range, an expert told the paper.
The size of the losses of the creditors in the end will be revealed after the end of the insolvency proceedings. A person close to this procedure did not radiate too much hope. For example, the around 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in the UK are "old" and many of the properties are in bad locations. Most money can probably be obtained with the sale of the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand, it said.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't rule this out, but we don't have any reliable information on it ourselves," said Ruben Neugebauer, spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They were accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators had been arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they let on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June, ramming a ship of the Italian financial police. On the same day, the three suspects are also said to have arrived there. Against the captain is under investigation for aid to illegal immigration.
US warns German government against Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great," Pai told Handelsblatt with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges every company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow instructions from the security organs.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC said, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to require suppliers to provide a "declaration of trust".
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology is not just hardware:
The software in particular is important to keep the devices up to date, and it’s made up of billions of lines of code that change over time,” Pai said.
“It’s very hard to imagine that a government agency, no matter where, would be able to review every single update in real time to detect security risks,” he said.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership relationship is opaque, and the employee company that allegedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told Handelsblatt.
Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the position of the US government, and he was also in Berlin for talks on how to promote the position of the US government.
Chemical plant in northern France burns: schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic wall of fire lights up the sky above a northern French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the clean-up could now take days.
After a fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and nurseries in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open on Friday as a precaution, said the responsible prefecture. The interior ministry had asked citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to expose themselves to the smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called on to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still the risk that odor will spread after the deletion, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters as well as 90 police officers and gendarmes were in use at the fire site.
A gigantic column of black smoke had previously emerged from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions at the Lubrizol factory, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored.In Italy, Seveso near Milan, there was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
Pierre-André Durand, the prefect of the Normandy region, told BFMTV that no "high toxicity" had been detected in samples at first. However, pollution of the nearby Seine River could not be ruled out. Dams against pollution had been built in the river, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning around 2:40 a.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: ‘Germany must invest now’
French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to make greater investments to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany needs to invest, and now, the sooner the better,” Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions."
Those states that have budget room for more investment would have to act, said Le Maire, among other things with a view to Germany.
France does not have these leeway, the minister added, referring to the high level of its national debt, which is more than 98 percent of its gross domestic product. The French national debt must be "stabilized" and "slowed down," Le Maire said.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investments to stimulate the European economy, and German politicians have repeatedly called on France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
Among other things, the French government is reacting to the protests of the yellow vest movement, with new debt expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to an expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson avoids question on Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticizes the "Capitulation Act" passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics, however, fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. Asked about this possibility, the Tory politician evades.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covering up whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the law passed by Parliament last week, which is exactly what is supposed to prevent this. On a question to journalists, Johnson said only that his government will adhere to the applicable law.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October, which Johnson criticizes as a “surrender law” that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The prime minister could use a procedural trick to delay the entry into force of the law for the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he was aiming for a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on October 31 and the best way forward is with an agreement."
Johnson’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said he felt the Brexit political debate was a “walk in the park” and was confident that the intended EU exit would still come about: “We are enjoying it, we are going to win, we are going to leave the EU, don’t worry,” Cummings told the British newspaper “Telegraph.”
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, now serves as chief strategist in the British government's Downing Street headquarters. He is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister into an almost hopeless situation.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - all of them stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it does not always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (pockets) plunges deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and touched when he presented the illustrated book "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The illustrious guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: “#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary pre-Instagram family, a celebration of LindaMcCartney’s legacy as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film.”
With Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, several hundred of which are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course, one is always in the center: her husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, calls in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or Scotland also led a very normal life. So according to the BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had always been a potatoe in a bed with her father.
Like almost no other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s shots are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It’s about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at the exact right moment,” said Paul McCartney. “If you snap two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo.” And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing just the right moment. “She just knew she had it,” Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the detail and the colors are all right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes sometimes seem like abstract paintings.The perfect addition to the newly released Beatles album "Abbey Road", which was released exactly 50 years ago.
“We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran.”
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighboring country despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he had attended the UN General Assembly.
But Erdogan admitted that Turkey has problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies have “retired because of U.S. threats.”
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this and many other issues," said the Turkish president, who has repeatedly criticized U.S. sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, and according to the United States, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and is not adhering to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the slump in Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf region have intensified significantly in recent months.
U.S. government wants to restrict the admission of refugees
The U.S. State Department said on Thursday that the annual limit of a resettlement program should be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, equivalent to a 40 percent cut.
The U.S. Department of State said that while the U.S. remains committed to supporting refugees, its primary mission is to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overburdened.
The U.S. government wants to focus on welcoming two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted for their faith, and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and who are at risk, as the statement from the State Department shows, while Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador will accept a maximum of 1,500 refugees.
The program, launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the United States. The top limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program’s history. The current top limit of 30,000 is already a low. When US President Donald Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number stood at just under 85,000.
“This is a very sad day for America,” said David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee, who said the U.S. would continue to hurt its leadership in protecting the world’s most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the U.S., both legally and illegally. The U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These numbers are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump: "Getting close to a spy"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers in the whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever gave the whistleblower, who accuses him of abuse of power, such clues "close to a spy," said Trump, according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York.
So Trump spoke in front of U.N. Mission staff. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial White House events, he replied, “This comes close to a spy.” Then Trump added, “Do you know what we did in olden times when we were smart? Right. The spies and treason, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now.”
Observers said the latter was a possible allusion to the death penalty, and the Democrats criticized Trump’s comments and accused him of intimidating witnesses. It was also an attempt to obstruct a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment case against him, the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Supervision Committees in the House of Representatives wrote.
The whistleblower accuses the president of abusing his office to solicit interference from another country in the 2020 US election. Specifically, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyj in the summer: In the conversation, Trump suggested he investigates his possible democratic challenger, Joe Biden.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower himself and his informants are, but as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is said to be an analyst of the foreign intelligence service CIA.
Refugee boat capsized: baby and toddler drown in Aegean Sea
Over and over again, people are trying to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece, with the often too small boats regularly capsizing. Seven migrants have now died in the sinking of a rubber dinghy, including five children.
Seven migrants have been killed in the sinking of a rubber boat off the Greek island of Chios. Among the dead were a baby and four other children, the Greek coast guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is said to be a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not yet known from which countries the migrants come. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in much too small boats. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The Who Break Down Concert
A US concert by the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end due to an austereness of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to serve. At the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should let it go while it's still running".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey "couldn't speak right now." The audience promised Townsend to get his money's worth at a reparation concert, but an appointment has not yet been set.
The Who canceled their scheduled gigs for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver. They are scheduled to catch up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear for billions of dollars in revenue.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. A few days ago, the company founder Adam Neumann had resigned as CEO, postponed the planned IPO and started with the sale of subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the executives to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, among other things, the British "Financial Times" reports, WeWork has completed the closing of new leases in London.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and rents it out to members in short term in partly small units. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork burns money with this business at a breathtaking speed. Last year, the company recorded a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. In this year's figure alone, the rent costs are expected to have increased by 2.5 billions of new rents to new large areas.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now entered into leases with terms of up to 15 years, resulting in obligations of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented almost 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months. WeWork's new contracts alone now ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the area newly launched at that time.
In the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could also shift noticeably without further expansion of the aggressive start-up. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis, purchased last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have converted their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off some of the hoped-for billions of dollars in revenue. Despite the long-term lease agreements, they do not have access to the - already scarce - reserves of WeWork. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out in the parent company, the so-called special purpose companies.
Russia again detained a large number of North Korean fishermen
A total of 262 other poachers have been arrested in the past few days, who had illegally fished in the waters, the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB told the agency Interfax on Friday.
Just ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, it was said. The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were thus traveling in Russian territorial waters, where the coast guard of Russia, according to its own information, patrols to protect their marine biological resources. During the re-checks, 30,000 squids had been discovered. In addition, according to the information, three fishing and two motor boats were seized and brought to Nakhodka and Posjet in total, Verdivostok, according to the agency Ria Novosti, more than 8,000 in 2018.
According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there in 2019, and the Russian fishing authority has not issued fishing licenses to North Koreans, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs.
The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Enterprises in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, also recently complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. With these also small creatures would be brought out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would need 200 years of technical and self-destruction.
Moscow said three members of Russia's coast guard were injured in the last week's arrests, while a North Korean man, who was also wounded, later died of his injuries. On September 17, Russian border guards first detained a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened fire.
U.S. Bans Entry to Former President Castro
The U.S. has imposed travel bans on former Cuban President Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro and his children, the U.S. State Department said in a statement on Thursday, citing Castro’s involvement in “gross human rights violations.” As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he advocates a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As the head of the armed forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also complicit in human rights violations there through the support of the President of Venezuela, Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro. "The Cuban regime's disregard for human rights and the use of force to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," US Secretary of State Mikeo tweeted.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday banned Venezuelan government and military officials from entering Venezuela. Venezuela has been waging a fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition for months. The US has imposed a series of sanctions on Maduro’s government to bring him to his knees and to bring the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaid<0xC3><0xB3> to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro’s closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of deployed doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to take to the streets today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international week of climate strikes, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. The time difference between New Zealand and Australia should start before the protests spread across Europe to North America. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to take part in a large-scale rally in Montreal, Canada. Protesters also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
How big the worldwide support this Friday will be after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday, over four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday we do it again!", she wrote on Twitter. So far, as part of the strike week, there have been 6,383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
Especially in Germany last Friday, the influx was very large. According to estimates by Fridays for Future, a good third of all worldwide demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities. According to a list of the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia, the people want to go to the
At the age of 15, Thunberg stood before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on her country’s politicians to step up their commitment to climate action. Within a short period of time, this has led to the emergence of the Fridays-for-Future movement. Students and pupils, but increasingly also scientists and other adults, are taking part in the climate protests.
Together, they demand more ambition from politicians in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate catastrophe, especially to curb global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial times, according to the Paris Climate Agreement.
Thunberg arrived in New York just over a month after a two-week transatlantic trip with a high-seas racing yacht. She had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke urgently to the heads of state and government of the earth in conscience. In her home Stockholm, the right-wing foundation was more for her on Wednesday.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony. This provides for a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the emergency ministry said on Thursday in Moscow, according to the agency Tass. The ban is to come into effect on October 1.
Anyone who smokes, however, must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should ignite a fire, then the penalty is higher. According to the Ministry, the ban also includes burning candles. Also grilling meat skewers on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Cybercriminals hit - Investigators lift servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time excavated a large server provider for illegal business on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle, about which international criminals operated their machinations.
The Prosecutor General’s Office in Koblenz announced this. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening during a major action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled via a server in the cyber bunker, according to investigators who destroyed the suspects’ customers, including the operators of the world’s second-largest darknet marketplace for drugs, “Wall Street Market”.
A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence, so that it can be used as a web host.
In the access operation with the support of special forces such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and neighboring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about more details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to take to the streets today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Climate protests <0xC7><0x80> Who are Thunberg’s backers?
Sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that heat the climate. All the more surprising that a 16-year-old girl of all people holds the mirror to the power man of this time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical mastery or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and gets young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, this is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt that he was chosen to stand up for a fairer world. At that time, he was also able to win over a crowd of young people to America.
But is there a dark side to this? Why does it take a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book, which has sold itself extensively, thanks to the daughter standing in the spotlight. Even the old-established followers of Greta Thunberg were very angry with the world.
Here now the spirits separate: Is it morally right to enrich oneself financially in saving the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue operation? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives behind certain ideas and discussions.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Crosses Our Solar System
A strange comet is currently crossing our solar system.
Astronomers have confirmed their suspicions: a strange comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time the researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. It was named after its discoverer 2I/Borisov and currently employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in Crimea. He looked up to the sky with a self-made telescope and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet, which is not from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind, which was spotted during the transit.
The comet is apparently similar to that of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. The comet is clearly of interstellar origin, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbolic orbit that takes it out of our system.
Comet was already spotted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before that time comes, astronomers will be able to observe it in detail, because, unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in its approach, which means that it can be studied from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen larger with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency Nasa.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about Comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comet - because, as the IAC researcher Julia de Le<0xC3><0xB3>n puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form by similar processes as in ours, added de Le<0xC3><0xB3>n's colleague Javier Licandro.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems, but this may not be the case.
Just recently, a giant asteroid was speeding past the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson horrified by brother
Boris Johnson is getting lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister scourges the warlike language of the prime minister with clear words as "tasteless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "fraud", "contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to arm himself - at least verbally. At Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this met with massive indignation from the opposition, and in the meantime more critics have come forward: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words such as surrender, as if opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered." She considers this to be extremely reprehensible. She does not recognize her brother's version again, Rachel Johnsons, who was in the EU Parliament elections for the anti-Brexit party, said.
She was particularly struck by the fact that her brother Jo Cox mentioned right-wing, an EU-friendly MP who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 withdrawal referendum. Their memory could best be honored by going through the Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons. "It is very distasteful to feel that the 'sister' of a deputation that was obviously 'the de facto' that was being murdered by someone.
Cox's widower also sharply criticized the prime minister. "It makes me sick when Jos Name is used this way," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is if you stand up passionately and resolutely for what you believe in - no matter what your opinion is. But you must never "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere has emerged in which attacks have become more likely.
Boris Johnson’s younger brother, Jo Johnson, resigned from his position as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory MP just a few weeks ago. “I’ve been torn between loyalty to the family and the national interest in recent months – it’s an unresolvable tension,” Jo Johnson said.
Johnson’s language has also met with sharp criticism in the Church. As the “Times” reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language, which is “not worthy of this country”. In a joint statement, they stated: “In the past few days, the language has not been acceptable, both in debates and outside parliament. We should speak with respect to each other.”
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL is sending a strong signal in the year of its 100th anniversary: In the halftime show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the halftime show at the upcoming final of the US Football League NFL, the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
“I am incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, who has incredible strength in the U.S.,” Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2 in Miami. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida live many people with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl puts two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed big hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen from November in the drama "Hustlers" in the German cinemas.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the mid-term guests is always eagerly awaited in the US. This year, many also regard the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. Usually at the NFL Finals well over 100 million viewers watch, it is now extremely popular in Germany as well.
Last year there was political controversy in advance. The reason for the dispute was the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who, in protest against police violence against blacks, had refused to rise up in the playing of the national anthem and had been hard tackled by, among others, US President Donald Trump. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had finally refused a Super Bowl appearance - including the Rockhanna and Pink 5.
An actor and Youtuber blames Egypt's ruler: For the time being, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who influence whether blood is flowing again on the streets of Egypt have spent the past week both abroad. One of them floated back at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general who in 2013 said the Muslim brother Mohammed Morsi, the first freely elected head of state of the country, to Sisi's political forces, the president of the United States had not left the airport in a pleasant time.
To mislead - according to the president, this is what the other man, who currently determines what is happening on the streets, is trying to do. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he evaded the grasp of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only to a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the leading voice of the country, calling the political moham to the country.
He approaches the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president revels in luxury and lets himself build magnificent new palaces, it is said there. The army leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he in his second profession as a contractor for 15 years made an impression with exactly these gentlemen, he seems to know at least exactly what he is talking about.
After last week for the first time since Sisi's grip after the power thousands had demonstrated against his rule and almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "million march" for this Friday. That really so many people would venture on the streets, was unlikely. But it was not possible to stop the protests in the first place, and in the case of protests, there was a small circle of protesters in front of police.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where protesters last week tore banners with the portrait of the president to pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces established checkpoints in the city and on the roads. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were blocked because of "maintenance work", the people were pushed out of the area, most of the streets around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution, until 2013.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be Tahrir Square," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not clash with police officers." As a retreat, however, this is not to be understood: "All of Egypt is Tahrir Square."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options.
If you conclude an Internet contract, you do not have to blindly trust the speed information of the providers. Customers can check for themselves in the event of anomalies, how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the transfer rates promised in advance are an integral part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Consumer Centre Bavaria.
If the connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options. For example, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the providers are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively," states the consumer center Bavaria on its side to consider.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of time, usually 14 days, to produce the promised service.
If this does not work even after multiple requests, customers can terminate and possibly also claim damages. But in the absence of success, only the legal action will help.
First-ranking Republican to investigate
“I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here will be determined by the facts that will be established,” Phil Scott said at a press conference Thursday, wanting to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking action — an impeachment procedure.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been watching Biden “for years.”
Republicans have so far held back from criticizing Trump for the whistleblower affair, and few have expressed discomfort about it. Scott’s comments are a first sign of this in Trump’s party, and Scott, a moderate Republican, has repeatedly opposed Trump’s policies, such as easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Spider-Man will remain in the MCU: Another Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August, it was announced that Sony and Marvel will go their separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how to proceed with the films around Tom Holland.
Spider-Man: Homecoming, Spider-Man: Far From Home, Spider-Man: Far From Home, Spider-Man: Far From Home, Spider-Man: Far From Home, Spider-Man: Far From Home, Spider-Man: Far From Home, Spider-Man: Far From Home, Spider-Man: Far From Home
Kevin Feige, a Marvel superstar, said: “I’m delighted that Spidey’s path in the MCU continues. I and everyone at Marvel Studios are thrilled to be able to continue working on it... He’s the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future holds.”
But how did the sudden good news come about? Allegedly, Sony Marvel has made an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney group, to which Marvel also belongs, would participate with 30 percent of the revenue coming Spider-Man movies. However, the news is not confirmed.
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to appear in 'Suits' finale
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the grand finale in the USA. In the last episode there were many happy endings and just as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, was paid tribute in a charming way. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers to the series finale.
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the finale for a final farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospectives showed the most memorable scenes with today’s Duchess, such as the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she greets him after his serving sentence.
But even her real husband, Prince Harry, was casually mentioned in the Suits finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is walking straight towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a telling remark about his suit.
Aegean: baby and four more children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned while capsizing a refugee boat in the Aegean Sea. A total of seven people died in the accident, the Greek coast guard said on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
At present, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route last year. Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he wants to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wants to find out in Turkey "what the situation is about the refugee situation", said Seehofer on Friday, and then in Athens to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in order to be able to help with the management.
A spokeswoman for the EU Commission confirmed on Friday Seehofer’s planned trip with EU Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
Greece continues to receive an unusual number of migrants from Turkey, with 654 people transferring to the Greek islands on Tuesday alone, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increased figures have recently cast doubt on the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey deal, which allows the EU to send back all refugees and migrants illegally coming to the Greek islands via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to take in a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian deported.
According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, almost 29 400 people are waiting for Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: 5,200 migrants are currently housed in a warehouse with capacity for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, there have been so many, reported the state broadcaster.
Climate Change: Heat Leads to More Heart Attacks
According to medical experts, climate change will put the healthcare system to the test in the future. Climate changes are "very certain" one of the biggest challenges for the healthcare system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society of Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and large temperature jumps in a short time to create and were increasingly affected by heart attacks.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photo breakdown
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green leader holds a reusable cup in a photo, but now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has been unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee mug with metal straw, Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never held in her hand. On the website of the party, she was seen in a photo with this mug, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also distributed to the media - and then the beaker was still a schöppen.
Greens boss has to answer for photo failure
The National Post then accused May of manipulating and producing fake news to appear more credible on the issue of "environmental protection" in the middle of an election campaign for the House of Commons election, in which Trudeau is increasingly struggling because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and sparked discussion about fake news, with one user sharing a juxtaposition of the photos, writing, "The Greens are manipulating a photo of their chairmen to hide their disposable cup."
May was shocked and insisted on her blog that she did not know anything about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: She, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she said, it was made of bamboo. She always had it with her. A spokeswoman of the party said that it was only to see the party logo in the picture, and not to hide something.
“I don’t want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide,” she told the Guardian, and asked for something from her over-committed team: “If they want to edit a picture again, can they not do something with my face so that I look younger?”
The German Greens have also fallen into shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel - their pictures, however, were not photoshopped. Thus, the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoon on vacation, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencer Wants Free Upgrade: Lifetime Flight Ban at Cathay
Allegedly, Jaqueline Ng was promised an upgrade by email from Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Getting an upgrade for Business Class spontaneously - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a change from Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-proclaimed influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the outbound flight, employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, even though she had shown an e-mail in which her Cathay Pacific allegedly promised an upgrade. The letter the influencer wants to have received from a marketing employee of the airline. The airline, however, accused Jaqueline of having faked the e-mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman is said to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they hacked into the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from which the mail allegedly came denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the mail system, in which the news did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaqueline’s ticket and imposed a lifetime flight ban with Cathay Pacific, which cost her $1,400 to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had reimbursed her the price of her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed back the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains blocked for future flights. The terms and conditions of the airline also say that she does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to settle with it - and now hires a lawyer.
Oil prices fall after Yemen cease-fire report
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the shortest possible time on Friday afternoon. Most recently, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea Brent variety cost $61.83 - around 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) variety fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
A Wall Street Journal report on a cease-fire in Yemen said Saudi Arabia had agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone strike on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities in mid-September had brought five percent of global oil production to a standstill. Houthi rebels allied with Iran in civil war-torn Yemen had claimed responsibility for the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the U.S. government, holds Iran responsible. A ceasefire would defuse political tension in the region.
If an agreement is reached, we can focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of raw materials strategy at Saxo Bank, Bloomberg News.
A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost nearly $59, Brent almost $65, and the price of the oil had risen to nearly $60.
Most recently, Bloomberg, citing insiders, reported that after the attack in mid-September, repair work on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia is progressing faster than expected, according to which the production volume has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving back in the direction of the original amount.
Recently, there have been several press releases, citing insiders, reporting on the rapid progress of the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work, but raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently issued release on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing the departure, while the ship is still at anchor, said shipping company chief Erik H<0xC3><0xA5>nell in a text message to the Swedish radio on Friday morning.
The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom has pushed oil prices up significantly in recent weeks, but the US has not been able to meet its expectations.
Accusations against Trump are growing
In the case of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, allegations of cover-up against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials had made intensive efforts, after a disputed phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj at the end of July, to prevent access to the wording of the conversation. This was explained by an anonymous whistleblower. The spokeswoman of the House of Representatives, the House of the White House.
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that the nuclear dispute will soon lead to a third summit between Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump. The sense and prospects of such a meeting are questionable due to lack of progress in implementing agreements from the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The US has done nothing to implement the decisions of the summit last year, said the adviser to the North Korean Foreign Ministry. He also criticized tightened US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the US and South Korea, but he hopes for a "wise" and "courageous" decision by Trump, so that there is again a rapprochement.
Trump said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim would bring before he agreed to do so. Negotiations for a disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi. In June, the two then met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states, but so far they agreed to re-engage without any major talks.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers to help with mine clearance
Dressed in a blue shatterproof vest, the British Prince Harry symbolically detonated and destroyed a blasting mine in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the place Dirico, he set up the firing circle. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded. With a view to the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later called for weapons in front of running TV cameras: "I am calling on all the countries to have their names on the countries to stand."
Pounds under pressure - interest rate cut expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of an early rate cut, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Frankfurt Speculation on the Bank of England’s (BoE) rate cut is on the rise, with the British currency down by up to 0.4 percent to $1,2269 on Friday.
The sales were triggered by remarks by central banker Michael Saunders, who called for a cut in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty will affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, as Saunders is considered to be an advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the broker house ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens on the economy due to the Brexit hack, without directly signaling a rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU if necessary, even without a divorce agreement on October 31.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations proven
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated – this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and current head of integrity of the World Athletics Federation.
At the start of the World Athletics Championships, new details about the doping scandal in Russia come to light - and they destroy the little credibility that the Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and even to some extent. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport had been revealed. After that, the Wada had blocked the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee, after individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, had around 270 athletes in the country compete under the neutral flag, at the Winter Games even Russian athletes were in the sports in February 2018.
Lack of positive findings
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information about the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They should help to punish athletes retrospectively. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analytical laboratory has been tampered with. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the correct data," David Howman said to those in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" in the January. "We have mentioned the positive data between the
The WM is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Federation is the only organization that holds the spell on Russia. At the World Championships in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
Earlier this week, the Wada had already placed manipulations in the room and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia now threatens the renewed lockdown of the Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
