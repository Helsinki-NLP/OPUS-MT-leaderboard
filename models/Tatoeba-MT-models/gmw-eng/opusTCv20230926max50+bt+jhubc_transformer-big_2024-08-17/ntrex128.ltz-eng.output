They're trying to make people look like idiots.
There are a number of MPs among them because of a suggestion that their title should be changed to a member of the Welsh Parliament.
It was created in order to change the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
People across the political spectrum are making a mockery of it.
A Labour MP was concerned that it would rhyme on Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means domme and pwp means kaka.
An MP for the Plaid party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was aware of the name’s change, but indicated that MWP and Muppet would not be far from one.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced the same as the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly's committee, which is currently developing laws to introduce the change of name, said: "The invalid decision on the appointment of the deputies naturally lies with the deputies themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public meeting on the proposal, which received much support.
The Commission favoured "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMPs", but the MWP option received more support in a public meeting on the question of the title of MPs.
The deputies seem to be proposing other options, but the struggle to reach a consensus can cause headaches for the presiding functionary, Elin Jones, who is expected to pass the draft law on the changes within two weeks.
Legislation on reform includes other changes, for example, such as the Assembly’s functioning, rules on the disqualification of deputies and the draft committee system.
This is the last word on the question, as they should be called, when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians are voting for a referendum on the name of the country.
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change the country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote was drafted in a proposal to settle a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly voted against its accession attempts for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of Vott over the change of name, said he does not want to recognize Vott.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that changing the name is the price to be paid to be able to join the EU and NATO.
The Church of St. Martin is as quiet as the churches during the Harlem struggle.
“Earlier people said that there was a café and a church on every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
"There's nothing left today."
He said the coffee shop was empty.
“People are socializing,” he said.
"They don't want to go to the grocery store where people go out on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as those responsible imagine, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
Church, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with condominiums and filled with people who did not help the remaining shelter areas in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings are white," he said, "and therefore want to close these churches quickly, because it is unlikely that most of these people will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black capital – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved in the 1930s.
A black community from not far away took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of traders on 125th Street, a major route for trade in Harlem that did not hire blacks.
The building was severely damaged by a fire in 1939, but when members of Father Johnson's community made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the play.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the clack game "The clacks of the poor."
The expert who played the video game in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the first bell game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to the larger bell game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What took place in St. Martin in recent months was a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs, some introduced by laymen, others by bishops' dioceses.
In July, the diocesan bishops wrote to the sacristy – the door’s governing body, with lay sponsors – with the concern that the diocese “would try to pass on the costs to the sacristy”, although the sacristy did not involve the office of architects and entrepreneurs, which the diocese was involved in.
Some pastors have complained about a lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old while diving in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday, when he was diving after lobsters in California, on the day of the opening of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m., not far from Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been on the shower with friends for half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy call for help and you were paddled over with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
At first he thought it was just the joy of catching a lobster, but then he realized that he was screaming "I was able!"
I'm going to get laid!"
"All of his clothes were taken away," he said as he walked up to his son.
"I told everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water.'"
The boy was taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.
The nature of the shark that attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said at a news conference that a shark had been seen a few weeks earlier, but this was considered a non-dangerous shark species.
Giles also said that the victim suffered from traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casabland to Swami’s in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and for security purposes.
Giles stressed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, most of which are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury’s is the epitome of Britain’s beauty.
Sainsbury’s takes on boots, superdrugs and Debenhams, with Kafhaus-style beauty departments with specialized assistants.
As part of a significant announcement in the UK beauty market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which is steadily growing, while fashion and home goods are returning, these larger beauty departments will be in 11 stores across the country, and next year in further stores if they succeed.
The supermarkets invest in beauty because they want to fill up the shelves that were otherwise reserved for the TVs, microwaves and other household goods.
Sainsbury's said they would scale from its beauty offerings to 3,000 products including for the first time with brand name Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The assortments of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees, which are currently available, will also receive more space with exclusive brand areas, similar to the boats shops.
The supermarket is also launching its boutique make-up range again, so that the majority of the products are vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by young consumers.
Perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will be testing concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, with the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and small amounts of everyday food in small stores means that supermarkets need to make more efforts to get people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's's manager, said the outlets were becoming more and more like department stores as the supermarket chain tried to fight more services and non-food products against discounters Aldi and Lidl.
ainsbury' has opened Argos-Ouletten in hundreds of days and has also bought several Habitats stores since the supermarket bought both chains two years ago. This has strengthened the sale of the food and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to overhaul the cosmetics and pharmacy department failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots, but the cooperation was quickly over after a dispute over the parts of the revenues of the drugstores and supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281drugs to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Llodys should play a role in the plan by launching an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, and four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty areas to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can ask the customer for advice.
Our range of brands is adapted to every need. Through a friendly environment and advantageous locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that represents the old ways of shopping and shade."
Peter Jones has signed a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with Holly Willoughby.
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, has become "black" after TV host Holly Willoughby signed a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The pair's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop.
This Morning's presenter, 37-year-old, announced on her Instagram account that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby ousted Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, from her lucrative Lifetsyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her new contracts Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "black" as the TV star admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - mean she has no time left for her homewear and accessories brand, Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop and doubled Willpughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones fled the UK and went to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: “It’s been a long time coming for Holly.
It would be their long-term future that would accompany them through the next century.
Their decision to leave was a surprise to all the people involved.
No one could believe what was going on at the beginning.
In the main quarter in Marlow there is a warehouse with goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the abandonment of the This-Morining presenter, who is one of the bankable stars from Great Britain, could cost the company millions, as they invest a lot in products, from kisses and candles to clothes and homewear, and there are now potentially delays to the launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been dating Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby brought Truly to the table with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, stepped in as president in March.
The couple are together and the holiday and Jones is 40 percent involved in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is the brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source with information about Jones said last night "We will not comment on his business affairs."
We're going to have a blast, and then we're going to get screwed.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media over a comment that some people would consider "not presidential," and because he is so positive about the North Korean president.
"Why did President Trump give up so much?"
Trump called it a “television presenter’s voice.”
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization are not forthcoming.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leading politicians during the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the U.S. to North Korea's earlier disarmament steps.
The U.S. will continue to push forward with sanctions to further pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"I'm very happy with North Korea," he said.
"We went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results – no more missile tests, the help to free hostages and the repatriation of American soldiers who had fallen in battle from mortal remains of missile tests held back, freed hostages held by insurgents and held hostage by prisoners of war.
And he has his unusual way of talking about relationships with Kim defended.
It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to climb into this overcrowded arena, I'd only have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to people directly in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been delocalized, no national catastrophe has been declared, a prerequisite for the catalyzing of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international aid, so it is a challenge," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet safe for foreign staff to work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for the national disaster management administration, said that Indonesian officials would assess the situation in palu to see if international agencies could participate in the aid measure.
With regard to the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is unfortunately not sufficiently prepared for the will of nature.
Even though tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, there aren't those anywhere on the coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although there has been a warning, has likely cost many lives.
The journey between the various Indonesian islands is often a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure the main topic of his election campaign and donated money for the roads and railways.
But Mr. Yoko's reign was also plagued by a lack of funding, where he set himself up again next year.
Mr. Joko is also exposed to the pressure of partisan tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority represent a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and a ten-thousand displaced from their homes, as Christian and Muslim groups fought with knives, bows and arrows and other brutal weapons on the streets.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge compares the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool with a goal in the 89th minute a Samsden at Stamford Bridge in London against a defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal and his team went 1-0 behind.
He took the ball with his left foot and shot towards the gold.
The attempt is high above the box, towards the right corner of the net.
The ball is about a jumping arrizabalaga flung into the net.
"It was just about getting into this position, getting the ball and playing games like Shaq was always as close as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible for us," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the edge coming and touched it once, and didn't think about it and just shot it."
Chelsea were 1-0 after the break ahead by a goal in the 25th minute of Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker made a pass back to Mateo Kovacic in this game before sprinting towards Liverpool half way.
Kovavic made a quick double pass in midfield.
He then shot a beautiful ball that sent the hazard into the box.
The Hazard runs past the defense and ends at the long Poto with a left-footed shot around Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832.
The death toll in Indonesia from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, as the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
According to the spokesman of the agency, Mr. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that had been destroyed by the earthquake by a magnitude of 7.5 and triggered the wave of up to 20 feet high.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with dust from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at Mews on John Street at 7:55 a.m. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
People from the area who have seen or heard anything should report to the police.
Police Inspector Brian O’Hagen said: “The investigation is still in its early stages, but anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious near John Street in Birkenhead should contact us.
I would also like to contact any other person, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded something on dashcam footage, because they may have information that may be important to our research.”
A police spokesman confirmed that a woman whose body was found was found in Birkenhead and was found in a house.
These afternoons are friends who think they know the woman, arrive at the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found in the morning.
Police continue to investigate and inform other members of the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just wanted to go back to his apartment, but police told him that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building at the moment.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
It is said that they will be able to return to their homes until they can return to their homes.
A police officer told a man that at the moment the whole area is considered a crime scene.
A woman comes to the scene in tears.
I always say, “It’s so scary.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police officers stood inside the fence and another outside the fence.
A number of police officers stood inside the lockdown and monitored the residential quarters.
Anyone who has any information should contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 Protocol 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament will be the new memorial stone, which will be affected by the series "Rewriting History."
His exile would be a poetic justification for the destruction of so many cultural and religious artifacts in England by the fanatical and puritanical supporters of the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society describes Mr. Crick's suggestion as "unsettling" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldmsith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In discussing the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell would become a target in front of the Palace of Westminster.
The symbolism of the English civil wars was ned ordered by Cromwell and not carried out.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hama Thorneycroft's large-scale representation of Cromwell is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a figure who still many people believe is worthy of being celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said in the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, perhaps first in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether or not it is an accurate representation is still an issue.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognisable figure representing one side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worth celebrating and remembered.
The pig-swallowed farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his family name Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery near a stall on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig breeder is preparing on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China, for an injection of vaccines for pigs into a hoffery.
According to reports, he was traveling with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered an open door to a nearby pigsty.
He said that in the stable was a large male pig with blood on the snout.
A forensic medical investigation has confirmed that a total of 550 pounds of hard-boiled pigs has crushed the farmer to death, according to the reports.
"My cousin's legs were bloodthirsty and bent," said the cousin's family name, "Wu," according to the Guiyang Evening News.
The images from surveillance cameras show the Yuan Donneschdes going to the market at 4:40 in the morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man is not a pig of Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig had been detained to prevent it from attacking other people while the police were collecting evidence on the spot.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the market authorities are likely to negotiate compensation for his death.
But even if they did, they would have been attacked by wild animals, and the pigs would have been killed.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts. The man was seriously injured.
In 2006, a <0xC2><0xA3>650 pig hit a Welsh farmer on the top of his tractor until his wife was able to chase the animal away.
After a farmer was eaten by his pig in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba explained to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
They're just gamers.
They just don't want you, they don't want you, they don't want you.
"You just have to show respect," he said.
Covering Rain in the Southwest of the U.S. by Hurricane Rosa
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens while moving over the cold waters of Mexico's north coast.
However, Rosa will bring flooding to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
The rose has winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane since 5:00 a.m. eastern time a Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugeni, in Mexico.
It is expected that the rose will move a sun to the north.
Meanwhile, a channel is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving towards the west coast of the United States, and the Pink Mountain is increasingly close to the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical humidity from the north to the southwest U.S.
The Rose will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity, which interacts with the more approaching channel, will form widely distributed heavy sluices in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain causes dangerous flooding, mudflows and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes gusts of 2 to 3 inches per hour in various places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts in the southwest, especially much of Arizona.
Floods are possible, with weather conditions becoming increasingly bad due to the destructive nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely sinister to walk into the desert with the risk of tropical avalanches.
Thick reeds can cause canyons that quickly turn into rivers and thunderstorms will bring local raw air and dust with them.
The upcoming channel will bring thick local rain to the parts of the southern California coast.
Slugs of over half an inch are possible, which can lead to small mudflows and slippery roads.
This would be the first race in the re-season.
Some distributed tropical travel lanes begin to get closer to Arizona, in the late sun and early mornings, before the tide continues to spread, in the late mornings and evenings.
It's going to be in the four corners and in the middle of a circle.
In October, there may be some intense temperature fluctuations through the United States, as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite hot.
Hessian's theory is that the temperature changes dramatically over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature fluctuations is there a sun in the center of the United States.
There is almost a 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the summer heat will try to build out and expand.
In many central and eastern United States, a warm start is expected in October with widely spread 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northwest.
New York City was able to reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast will provide high chances of exceeding temperatures for the eastern United States by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
Over 20 million people watched a sweeping statement on the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh and wife Christine Blasey Ford, whom he accused of sexual assault, which is supposed to have happened in the 1980s, on six television channels.
Meanwhile, political sakgas are running out, and broadcasters have suspended regular broadcasts for the last-minute twist of a Friday: an agreement signed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake with the FBI to make investigations during a week of allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was fully groping them and trying to take them out at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a pathetic statement, said he was 100% sure that didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people watched the trial.
The company has an average viewership count on CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers of other networks that carried the process, including PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen often has some difficulty in counting people who look in offices.
To illustrate the whole: The viewership number corresponds to that of a playoff football match or the Oscars superstition.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators supported Kavanaugh's appointment, channeled all of the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the trial over the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Interests remain high in the process.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he became a Friday morning demonstrator while trying to get a lift for trial on the Judiciary Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes looking down as he was cheered on and was live on CNN.
"I'm right here," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He was told, "You have power, while so many women have no power."
Flake announced that his office had submitted a statement and, before the elevator closed, that he would have to say more after hearing the committee.
The cable and radio networks all later reported live stonewalling how the Judiciary Committee should vote to bring Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for the vote.
But Flake said that he will only do so with the understanding that the FBI is investigating the charges against the nominee for next week, what the Democrats minority wanted.
Flake was partially convinced by the talks with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a few senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice had power, because it was evident that Republicans would not have the choice to vote Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh indictment.
The British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" regarding Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of leaving the European Union to "play politics" with the British future and weaken national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, alongside her on the newspaper's front page, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, highlighted his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a suggestion that Britain and the EU should raise their taxes on each other would be "quite ridiculous."
Wayde-Sims shooting: The police have arrested the suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player.
The police have arrested a suspect in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested for second-degree murder and taken to prison, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the dispute.
The police found the glasses on the spot and said that they found Simpson's DNA on it, CBS partner WAFB reported.
After Simpson was arrested, police said he had confessed to shooting Wayde.
His deposit was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The office of East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner released a provisional report saying the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department honors the fugitive officers of the Louisian State Police, the State Poice Crime Lab, the Southern University Police, and residents from the area for assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local police for their "failure to seek justice."
The Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01-meter tall grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
In a statement, the LSU basketball coach said his team was "disrupted" and "shocked" after Wayde's death.
"That's something that's always been a concern," Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
Spoiled ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Catastrophe Protection warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it became active in the crater, and recorded 183 gas and ash sessions in the last 24 hours.
The center showed some thunder and bee stings.
Images on social networks show thin layers of ashes on Mexico City's cars and neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in volcanic activity that has shaken 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-strong earthquake struck Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence elections.
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protests with police clashed, and as thousands took part in rival demonstrations for the first anniversary of the Catalan polarising election for separation.
A group of masked pro-separtists were held back during riots against the police with eggs and powder paint, which formed dark clouds in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
The fire broke out later in the day, and the police took out their batons to control the fighting.
Over a few hours, pro-independence group called "No Forget, No Forgiveness" against unionists who called "long-lived Spain."
Fourteen people had to be medically treated after injuries to the protesters, reports the local press.
Tensions remain high in the region of independence a year after the October 1 referendum considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose the majoritarian to become independent, but the result was only against the separation by the Boycott of the election.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the election in polling stations across the region from violent conflicts.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Friday over the night to prevent a demonstration about the support of the national police.
The protest went on, but it took a different turn.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who took part with his wife in the separatist protest, says he no longer has any hope as far as the perspective of an independent Catalonia is concerned.
“I’ve had a lot of bad moments in my life.
I saw my parents crying out of joy because they could choose, but now I'm stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive, albeit narrow victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties had a hard time staying in shape this year. Most of the best-known leaders were in exile or in prising and waited for their role in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on the phone as support for the police, said that the conflict has been heated by politicians from the two sides.
"There will be more and more," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in the preventive prison since the end of last year, has announced to Samschden that he will participate in the European elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car ran into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly ran into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Insp Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point a gun was fired at the car with a broken arm.
Livingston won 1-0 against Rangers through Menga's goal.
Dolly Menga's first gold secured the win.
Livingston was promoted to the rank of Rangers for Steven Gerrard's only second win in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's storm proved the difference as Gary Holt switched sides with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's side remain undefeated in the Premiership this season and play against the Leaders Hearts on Sunday, who are eight points ahead of them.
Rangers Rapid Vienna have played in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extend their run in the division to six games, with coach Holt still tasting victory since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is known for his anti-opportunity views.
The team would have had their nose cut long before the hit, as their directness caused the ranger's problems.
Scott Robinson stepped through but carried his effort to the front of the Gol, then Alan Lithgow could only finish his effort in front of Craig Halkett in front of the Gol.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause misery among the visitors.
That's how the gold fell.
The Rangers got a free kick and Livingston stood up, combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson to play Menga, who once touched and hit the center of the box.
At that point, the Rangers dominated the possession but found the home defense impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly quiet.
The pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a parade of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers Golkip Allen McGregor and Lithgow shot wide of yet another toy train from Livingston.
Crusaders always came back to Livingston's box and were always cleared, while two yards were required - after the halket challenged substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were knocked out.
"Wonderful" by Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena.
It's a remarkable achievement for Livingston.
To a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this high road.
Their style of play and staff has hardly changed since returning to the top flight, but great credit has to go to the pits for the way that he has refreshed the team since his arrival.
He's got a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a super organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall through on their moves.
The Rangers had a lot of inspiration.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they fell short of the standards.
The last pass failed – only when they opened the home side – and there is something like a wake-up call for the Rangers who found themselves in midfield.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives a reception in Cologne.
There were laughs in blue skies on Saturday (29 September) when the chiefs of Turkey and Germany saw enough to drink coffee in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – which was planned to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have spoken about problems including human rights, press freedom in Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an made his way to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police have proposed security measures to block a strong crowd of 25,000 people from their meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters have stepped up to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – have also heard their voice, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
Both protests reflect the divisions of a visitor who is hailed as a hero by several German Turks and a monarch by others.
Deptford road accident: Cyclist dies in collision with car.
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred not far from the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southwest of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the rescuers helped, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred months after a cyclist died during a driver's escape on Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash on Saturday.
The city police said that the officer went to identify the man and inform the family.
Road closures in bus routes are advised on the spot and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Injury
Six suspects have been injured in an injunction in a high-security prison for men, the prison officer said.
Order broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and it continues.
Specialist "Tornado" officers were brought in to take care of the order, which involved eight prisoners in a wing.
Officers were placed on the spot for small wounds in the face.
A spokesperson for the prison said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to take care of the incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff were treated for baldness.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police are responsible and could spend more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was being treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, offensive officers were called to prison to deal with a serious disorder in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (drought areas can benefit)
It's rare to encounter a tropical depression in Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen at the beginning of next week as Hurricane Rosa's last-ditch energy pulls down through the southwestern desert and brings flooding risks.
National weather events have already caused flooding for major cities and towns, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the direct route via Phoenix to Denschden and get closer to the finish line.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix wrote in a Twitter post that only “ten tropical cyclones have been able to maintain the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest national hurricane center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated sums up to 6 inches of rain in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert including the central Rockies and the Great Basin get possible 1 to 2 meters, with isolated sums up to 4 meters.
For those without flood risks, Rosa’s rain is a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although the flooding is a very serious concern, some of the rain will probably be good because in the southwest are currently dry conditions.
Just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least an extreme drought, the second-highest category," weather.com reports.
Hurricane Rosa makes its way to land on Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, still with hurricane force one Sunday morning with maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm hit the Pacific Ocean, causing it to lose its strength.
So, it is expected to clear land in Mexico with tropical storms strengthening on Monday in the afternoon or evening.
Traveling across parts of Mexico could be difficult, putting a significant flood risk.
"Lower winds of 3 to 6 meters are expected from Baja California and the northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 meters possible," says weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, where she will then move up through Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday night.
The main threat expected from Rosa or her remains is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the United States' southwestern desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is expected that these rains will produce life-threatening floods and mudflows in the desert, and dirt in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton's four-year-old man charged with murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The juvenile was found injured near the Excelsior Terraces in Midsomer Norton, near 4 a.m.
When he was brought to the hospital, his condition was stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man have been arrested overnight near Radstock, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police have called him to report to the police, who may have picked up something with their cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh is deeply saddened by the rise of the Democratic Party.
"The election of Judge Kavanaugh as an election against the reckless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered through all the recklessness and annoyance of the Democratic Party throughout the election process.
Kavanaugh was vehemently and emotionally dismissive of Christine Blasey Ford's suggestion that he should have sexually harassed her when they were teenagers.
Ford has also made it clear that he's in favor of this.
The president told a Samsden that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's brilliance and quality and courage."
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as a vote for one of the best lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a confirmed number of deaths for the public.
Kavanaugh's nomination was announced by the president during his speech on the importance of Republican electoral participation and the half-way point of the election.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
"I'm not running, I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I'm going to go everywhere to fight for great candidates."
Trump has argued that he is on a mission to "become and brake."
The first decisive election at Senate level for Kavanaugh's nomination should already take place a Friday, a senior staffer told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, many have been washed away as huge waves hit the coast, as a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities on Samsden said.
Hundreds of people took part in a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday as 6-meter-high waves swept across the coast in the semi-darkness, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The Tsunami is believed to have an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"As the tsunami became threatening yesterday, people were still pursuing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesian disaster relief, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it was full of cars, huts, Hzisers, everything ripped away from the land," Nugroho said, even more precisely that the tsunami on the sea had speeds of 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
Some people have climbed trees to escape the tsunami and have survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial footage made public by the disaster relief agency shows many buildings and buttocks being destroyed, bridges being ripped away and collapsed into a mosque all surrounded by water.
As a result, the Samsaras moved to the coast.
The population of the city is estimated at 2.4 million people.
The agency for the evaluation and use of the technology said in a statement that the energy released during the earthquake freed the power had fallen by 200 times the atomic bomb during World War II on Hiroshima.
The geographical situation of the city at the end of a long-winded bay may have exacerbated the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho has described the shading as "extreme" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
Bodies were found among the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, plus 540 injured and 29 missing.
The Nugroho so that the injuries and damage to me could be great on the 300 km long coast north of Palu, in an area called the Doggola and date me close to the epicenter people.
The communication "has completely collapsed and we are without information" of Donggola, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are on their way to affected areas.
"It's a bit of a stretch, but it can be a bit of a stretch," he said.
The agency's response to Samsden's strong criticism was that the tsunami had hit Palu, officials said the waves were coming out at the same time as the warning.
Amateur images on social media show a man on a higher level who, by shouting at you on the street below, warns of the tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water meets the coast, and buildings and cars travel mats.
Reuters was not able to confirm the images directly.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage and the communication around Palu seemed to be slowing down, and the authorities were hard at work coordinating the rescue efforts.
The army sent first transport planes with aid supplies from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuees still need urgent food and things for the most important needs.
The local airport was just opened for rescue teams and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 800.
And it's all sloppy.
While the staff of World Vision of Donggola arrived safely in Palu City as, where the employees and tent towns were interrupted on the grounds of this office, several scenes of destruction had to go by themselves, according to Lord Doseba.
"I've been told that there are a lot of things that are going to destroy me," he said.
And it's all sloppy.
As soon as the aid teams began to recognize the extent of the destruction, some complained that foreign aid teams with great experience did not allow the arrival of refugees on Palu.
According to the Indonesian laws, matérial and personnel are only allowed to enter the country if the area affected is declared as a national disaster area.
"Dude, it's just happened.
"It's still a regional catastrophe," said Auliya Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Soubal's government says, 'OK, it's like a national catastrophe,' we can open up for international aid but that doesn't happen yet."
As the second night in Palu comes after the earthquake and tsunami of peace, friends and families hope that here missing are among those wonders you will always appear after such disasters.
As a result, Sam's little brother was rescued from a canal.
A rescuer rescued a woman who was buried under a pile of rubble, right next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders who were shot for the Asian Games,
Others from the Roa Roa Hotel were singing students, according to Lord Mandagi.
"When I'm in the middle of a storm, I feel like I'm in my own emotional state," he said.
Mr Gendon as below, in the hours following the news when the rumour of the collapsing of the Roa Roa Hotel and the paragliding group went around, WhatsApp sent messages to the team that participated in the Beach Festival.
Unfortunately, there was only one of them, and only one of them was wearing a pair of gloves.
"I'm going to tell you that I'm not going to give up on gin," he said.
Robbers stole $26,750 during the fall of a vending machine in Newport/Levee.
The raiders allegedly stole $26,750 in Newport/Levee from a Brink's security guard who was in the process of filling the bank, according to a letter from the Newport Police Department.

Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Twitter, he wrote: "The one officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and has used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The band will perform on Saturday Night Live, where they will be releasing a new album.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande di for "emotional reasons" not being able to appear in the show, according to the show's founder.
Even though it's an abbreviation for a professional name, the West has previously said that the word also has a religious meaning for it.
"I believe 'ye' as the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West told me early in the year, at a presentation of his new album on Radio Big Boy.
"If I am you, I am the sea, I am the sea."
It comes from Kanye, date means the only one, in only Ye - a mirror of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
It's like a mirror of who I am."
He is one of the many famous rappers to have his name changed.
Sean Combs was once known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he decided to go for Love and Brother Love.
A former West's vocalist, JAY-Z, has also always played with minor and minor vocals.
The U.S. military in Mexico has vowed to use force against civilians.
In the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the bloody end of hostilities against students, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use the military against the civilians.
Lopez Obrador has promised Samsden that "the military will never use force to oppress the Mexican people."
During a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, the troops shot at the people and encouraged 300 at a time when the lower left-judged return passed through Latin America as.
Lopez Obrador has announced young Mexicans will be supported by monthly grants to students and by the opening of more free universities.
He has said that the unemployment rate and the lack of school funding promote criminal gangs.
The U.S. would be willing to pay the price for the
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the sum in research in the field of artificial intelligence, says the investor and friends of the AI Kai-Fu Lee, who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after more and more circles of the U.S. government agree that the U.S. does not have a proper strategy in researching the AI.
Meanwhile, China has unveiled its plan for the last year: the first in AI research to be completed by 2030.
"The doubling of the research budget of artificial intelligence as a good start, considering that all other nations are so far behind the United States, and we are working on the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funding may double the chances of the next jump being measured in the United States, Lee CNN said in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month came out at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, as CEO at Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most well-known AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, later becoming general manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
Lee knew about the previous technology competitions in the United States such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when you would be next, to help you find your next visionaries.
The U.S. government often has to work hard to get state aid, according to Lee.
"It's not just China, it's China, it's China, it's China," he said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have engaged the luminaries and the burdensome years of universities to work on AI.
In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice has also increased the number of U.S. immigration laws in the country.
"I think the Green Card should be automatically offered to professors in AI, so he said.
The Chinese government launched its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations will do for US researchers, but the quality of academic work as in China is not as good, according to the LEE.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Ministry of Defense set up joint AI centers to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of an Artificial Intelligence Committee.
In this month, DARPA has announced a $2 trillion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, which is currently investing over $100 million in AI.
The U.S. National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NCAI) has been working on a case-by-case basis.
Macedonia voted in a referendum to change the country's name
In a referendum on whether or not to change the name to "Republic of North Macedonia," the full-blown Macedonian bloc has taken steps to defuse an oil dispute with Greece that prevents admission and membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of Noopea is trying to designate the province as safe and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments negotiated a proposal on the new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change undermines the ethnic identity of the majoritarian slave population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has shown that it is difficult to achieve the required 50 percent for the elections to apply.
The referendum said: "If you are in favour of a NATO and EU membership with acceptance for the agreement with Greece."
Endorsers of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the prize would be considered to be sufficient for a recording in organizations such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of Macedonia so that young people live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it will mean safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Despite the fact that it is legal, many members of the House of Representatives have been told that they would stick to the outcome of the vote.
There is a two-thirds majority in parliament.
As a result, there will be no voter turnout until the 13th round of the election.
Nevertheless, the electoral participation was only 16 percent, compared to the parliamentary elections in 2016 where 66 percent of the eligible voters had voted.
"I came here to vote for my children, our place as in Europe," Gjose Tanevski, 62, told Wiehler in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko have announced in the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country to level the path to NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardakov, 54, has set up a small stage in silence in front of the tents of those who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get head high, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We're proud of our country, but we're proud of our country.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev's so-called NATO membership would bring us important investments in Macedonia, which has a Chomagetas share of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority of the population for this reason as well as more than 80 percent of the inhabitants for NATO and the EU than," said Zaev after leaving the electoral booth.
He said that "yes" would be the result of "confirmation for our future."
According to a poll by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, 30 to 43 percent of the voters in the referendum would take part - less than required.
Another poll, by the Macedonian television station Telma TV, found that 57 percent of the respondents had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent of the time, they're going to be squirming.
For the referendum to be valid, 50 percent plus one vote must be cast.
This would be the first election to be held in the first round of the pro-Western government's anti-government campaign.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero breaks through Brighton's entire defences and makes a goal

The Argentinian striker scored a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the run.
He ran as a test three defenders from Brighton and then hit the open field.
The Aguero came down to four opponents.

The man who played the game against the scoundrels
With the selection of the Nationals in the playoffs, as a reason to force a new start.
But the ever-ready-to-execute henchman hopes to take the lead against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies are still in the playoffs who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers and the NL West.
The Rockies clinched a wild-card with a 5-2 win against the Nationals a Friday night, but still struggled to solidify their title in the first division.
"Even if we play for nothing, at least we can make a big game, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the public and the other team that is likely to play at the highest level that I will experience this year.
Why shouldn't I stand up for it?"
It's important for the locals to be aware of what's going on, but it's a good idea to make sure they're prepared for this kind of situation.
The joker, who will play his 34th start, threw a Thursday a bullpen session and will play a Sunday on his break day.

Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The president has pointed to the situation surrounding his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the Upper House while pointing to the importance of a Republican victory in these midterm elections.
"We've all been on the edge of our seats in November.
Five weeks before the biggest elections in our lives.
This as one of the big, big — I'm not running but I'm running really that's why I'm fighting for good candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these formidable, formidable radical groups of Democrats, you see how it's going to happen now.
And they are determined to take power under all circumstances, you see the sinlessness, the community.
Those as it doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to convince in order to gain power and control, dat as it wat they want, the power and control, we don't give them them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission of "resisting and blocking."
"And you see that in the last four days," he says, referring to Democrats as "rosy and sinless and nauseous and lost."
He mentions the Judiciary Senate Committee with the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was most recently ousted.
"Do you remember the answer?
Have you read the document?
- Uh, uh, waat.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Work is no longer God's work.
It's intolerant of those who think.
When I was asked to vote for my opponent in the polls, I didn't vote for him.
Finally, I'm the last person to get fired from a labor party who would be welcome only because we think so wat we think.
My party colleague Joan Ryan has been treated as similar because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism as.
In my case, as the censorship criticized me for not being right about Jeremy Corbyn.
Matt's view of the importance of a responsible approach in the economy, national security, in Europe, ironically similar circumstances in which Jeremy has complained to forward-thinking leaders.
The note for Nottingham East workers meeting on Friday says that "we want our meeting inclusive and productive."
In most of my 8 years as a local labor representative, the Friday evening meeting was exactly the same.
Today, unfortunately, as the day did not sound at many meetings and the promises of "my friendly, my fine" policy as long as forgotten, anyway, has ever been so.
It is becoming more and more surprising that other opinions will not be tolerated in the workers party and any opinion will be deemed to be unacceptable as for the party leadership.
This is as soon as Jeremy took over the leadership, as colleagues with whom I had previously thought we would have had similar political views on eons that I would have taken the reins and positions I would otherwise have never accepted - in national security as well as in the EU internal market.
Every time I've spoken publicly - and it's not really important I'm saying - I then get a tirade of comments on social media against the policies of the middle, and I don't think I'd have my place in the workers' party.
It's just like my experience.
However, I know I'm getting better than some of my colleagues because the comments I get are political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are exposed to sexist or racist remarks every day and hardly look away.
One of the saddest aspects in these political times is how the level of abuse is becoming more and more normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for the workers' party to adopt a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer of God and with every "non-confidence" movement or change of election rules the party becomes more and more clear.
Over the past two years, I've gotten a lot of advice to keep me quiet, not to be too loud, and then I'd be "in line."
But that's not why I came to politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, prompted by a negligence of the Thatcher government during which my classroom almost collapsed, I have tried to improve public services for those who need them most – whether as a local politician or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been able to doubt my political position and the points at which I am not in agreement with the current leadership.
For those who favor the movement of Fridays, all I want to say is if the country opposes a Brexit, that this will harm the housing, trade and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my commitment to the Labour Party.
But the only message I have is concerning Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve and I promise that no threats or political statements will stop me from acting accordingly, which I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose Ayr unbeaten no up
Two attempts in recent times have boosted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves the triumph in this spectacular Tennt's Premiership match of the day.
They're now in the top 10, the only ones out of 10.
Finally, it was a better defense, just like the improved grasp of chances, over which the home team and coach Peter Murchie could be happy.
"We've been challenged in our matches so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said, "Good for Ayr, they've captured the odds better than me."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, spearheaded by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, which he received in a game of the Warriors, weakened Melrose and Jason Baggot was able to start an unaltered attempt.
Climo was able to convert a penalty kick for Ayr, just before half-time, he then converted an attempt on his own to score 17:5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's run, implemented by Baggot, was able to reduce difference to five points.
After an interruption due to an injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was fouled, and a new start, Ayr was able to restart through a run by Stafford McDowall, implemented by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, then got a yellow card, and again, Melrose was able to take advantage with a run by Bruce Colvine, after strong pressure.
The home team came back, as always, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he tucked Climo on the power line without a ball, Macpherson was able to score a touchdown in the back of attacking Ayr.
Climo was able to convert when he did so from the start, after Kyle Rowe was able to kick off David Armstrong's kickoff and left flanker Gregor Henry in the fifth round.
A new career in the hospitality industry
Still star player Ford Kieran is looking to switch handsomely to the hotel industry after finding out that he has been nominated director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the well-known BBC show he writes and in which he plays as a co-star with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next 9 episodes will be the last of the show, and Kiernan is planning to do something new after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is directing Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor borrows any comment on the story, although a source from the "Scottish Sun" has revealed that the Kiernan is about to enter "the flourishing restoration industry" of Glasgow.
The sea belongs to us: Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrolling under tackle in the main quarter of La Paz.
Public buildings have been flagged by an ocean blue.
From the Titicaca Sea to the Amazon, the sea is ours: "The sea is ours.
It's our duty to take care of it."
Throughout the country, Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a conflict in the 19th century, is still alive – the will to sail out again on the Pacific Ocean.
The hope is now greater than ever, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has the élan, the spirit of togetherness and serenity and, of course, hopes for a positive decision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens in the hope that The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia and – after decades of sporadic talks – Chile will be forced to negotiate with Bolivia about sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year – relies heavily on the talks of a Monday.
"We're heading to the Pacific," he said in August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favor of Bolivia – and that not much would change if it did.
The UN agency, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, has no violence over Chile and has stated that it is not involved in any possible talks.
The fact that the court's decision has already been upheld for 6 months after the final hearings shows that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
In the case of the last four years, the Bolivian government has relinquished it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been torpedoed by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales's combative rhetoric has weakened all Chilean will.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will then be very difficult to pre-empt the talks after that.
The two countries did not have any ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, as Bolivia's representative in The Hague, reiterated that the court's decision was made particularly quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia offered "an extraordinary opportunity for a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end a 139-year-old dispute with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also pointed out that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – uses the maritime exit as a political springboard.
"Bolivia never ceases to claim its right to access the Pacific," he said.
"It's a great opportunity for us to get behind our backs."
North Korea says nuclear weapons won't happen before the U.S. can trust it
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to disarm if it can't trust Washington.
He spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises given to the presidents of the rivals at the summit in Singapore.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tried to revive nuclear negotiations of diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
The Ri says it is "a dream" that further sanctions in the United States' appeal against a declaration for the Korean War would force Korea's knees ever bent.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration, without Pyongyang taking the first steps towards a massive disarmament.
Kim and US President Donald Trump have called for a second summit.
But there is a general scepticism that Pyongyang is seriously considering the disarmament of an arsenal that sees the country as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim Trump summit.
The Paris fashion show shows a massive rise of head coverings on the streets.
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, don't look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne reveal a bunch of oversized headwear on the catwalk for their SS19 collection, which showcases the style at the Paris Fashion Weeks.
Absolutely impractical heat flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's highlight was an oversized beige hat with something that resembled a feather and flooded the model's head.
Other oversized accessories with beautiful watermelons, a mixture of hats and pineapples – but they are not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne wears a mask for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks have closed lips and are more similar to the Hannibal Lecter than the haute couture.
One creation resembles a diving costume complete with snorkeling and glasses, while another looks like a melted glacecornet.
When you see me, you will be disappointed.
You'll be surprised to learn that the giants are on their way to you.
The oversized heat strongly resembles the feast of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 cm wide board, which one has already seen at Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical heat that has flooded the social media sends yet another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach basket as large as the model, who represents it.
The deep orange bast basket, with bast fringe angels and a white leather handle, was the main focus in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacques on the Paris Fashion Weeks.
Star stylist Luke Armitage said: “I expect to see big heat and beach crest on our streets next summer – because designers have made such a big impact, it’s hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are indispensable for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools hold the record for academic achievement and this continued in 2018 with new outstanding exam results, which could only be strengthened by individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other social endeavors.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), want to strive for the best level of service for their students and parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for further education in higher schools, for their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As an educational institution with a graduate and discussed curriculum, we see modern languages as popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "When you talk to a person in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, that goes into your heart."
This is a strong reminder that we should not only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
With this test, we can see that languages are at the very top, with the best results within independent schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages graduated with an A+.
The data collected by the 74 SCIS schools shows that 72 percent of students have an A+ in Mandarin, while 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish have also reached an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that students and young people undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as an elective are now considered to be the same as major subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, but also elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the English Commission on Professions and Skills found that employers indicated that it is difficult to fill vacant posts, 17 percent due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming more and more important to prepare young people for their future tasks.
With more future job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are becoming increasingly important in a global world.
Regardless of the career that one chooses, if one learns a second language, one has a real head start into the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the forefront of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in England, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, with French still coming into the two-digit range as a single language with 15 percent.
That is why it is so important to invest in the learning of languages in today's children.
Multilingualism, especially those of growing economies, offers children better chances of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school offers different languages.
A host of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages could be more important for England after 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there are always a bunch of languages in the independent schools to choose from, with teachers specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools are keen to provide a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve something, no matter what the future looks like.
It cannot be denied in a global business environment that languages are vital to the future of the country and that must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages must be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools offer this choice, variety and exciting performance for the young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is directly in the Scottish Red for independent schools
LeBron makes his debut for the Lakers and Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the fans who are waiting for LeBron James to start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play a Sunday in the pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It only needs to be determined how many minutes he plays.
"They're more like one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely playing a limited number of minutes.
As usual, James was asked early this week about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason program.
"I don't need a preseason game at this point of my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's election tour in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins the evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, a flurry of whaling campaigns.
It's Trump's first of five tours in the next week, with stations on him friendly-minded places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote and the sweeping vote for his election to the post of Supreme Court Justice, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming mid-term elections, saying that Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the elections are held in November.
What is Trump's response to the West Virginia election, and how do you look at it online?
Trump's election event for West Virginia is scheduled for tonight, Samsden, September 29, 2018, 19 o'clock ET time.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia whaling event online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump would mention this week's impeachment for Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh, whose election was put on ice for a week due to allegations of sexual abuse with a former senator while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the first goal is to help Republicans win face-to-face in the November elections and get new momentum.
So President Trump's campaign said the five events next week set the goal of "giving volunteers and supporters new energy while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so critical to its agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible during the important time of the campaign," a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the whaling event may bring evening supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be treated by the Pittsburg media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Samsdeg is the second time last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican senatorial candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is returning to the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to come to help him get calls into the polls," said Simon Haeder, a West Virginia University political scientist, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018 The USA team demonstrates courage in the fight to keep the hopes of the individual battles alive on Sunday
After three one-sided meetings, the four-legged fight can be a samsung gnome just what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swing swing is a very invented sport concept, but one that the players believe in, and never more so than at such competitions as these.
Where do you say the water is clean?
"They had a lead of six points and now there are still four, so we're seeing that as a little baby-sitting now," Jordan Spieth said as he quit for today.
Europe has the advantage; of course, four points lead to play after twelve.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel a little wind in their sails and they have a lot to be excited about, not to mention the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together every day, and both of them tackled with three out of four points.
The spire was deadly from the tea to the green and is an example.
The joyous keel-jawed became louder as his round progressed, sinking an important putt to tear the game apart and where Thomas is two of two behind him.
His putt, by which they won the match at 15, was credited with a similar circuit, of that kind, which gave a feeling that he believes the American team is not out there.
"You just have to dig deep enough and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that this game has to offer.
18 holes to score.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undiscussed legends of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's old, but popular couple are four out of four ahead of them and can't do anything more wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't shoot a bogey on Saturday night, but they did avoid the Saturday walls, Friday walls, and the nine back a Friday wall bogey as well.
On this run, and just as their energy seems to flow at and from the spectators, they cement that they are the players who are going to beat it on Sunday, and there will be no more popular players to bet on a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, like Fleetwood and Molinari.
At the moment, the two of them are on a different wavelength.
However, even after a European victory, it is still a matter of pride.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning in Fourball, when he was a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could no longer get out so quickly.
There's no one there to make you laugh.
The four balls and fours are so fascinating to look at because of the interactions between the couple formations; the laughs they give; the laughs they don't give in the way a strategy and an insight can change.
Europe has so far played better as a team and is going well in leading for the last day, but this four-game meeting also showed that the USA team has the will to fight for what has been doubted, especially the Stateside.
Europe's 10-6 win at the Ryder Cup
Europe had a healthy advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after a Samsden's fourth ball in the fourth match against the United States with 10-6.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead the game with two wins over a fluctuating Tiger Woods to take their lead to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn on the European side, who lost the trophy to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a badly started American side in the four-ball, putting the series at 3-1.
The United States offers more resistance in the fourth, wins two games, but they don't get the deficit picked up.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from 12 individual matches to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row while in the Molinari, joining "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend only to be the second pair to make four points since the first four games in Ryders Cup history.
Against Woods and Patrick Reed won in four-ball, they harmonized well against empty Woods and American freshman Bryson Dechambeau at a friendly 5&4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two matches at Samsden, sometimes showed brilliant outbursts in the four balls and fours and sevens in a row.
Justin Rose, who was suspended in that four-ball game in the morning, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the fours and ended up with 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the first and third listed in the world.
Europe doesn't just have it on a beautiful, sunny day in south-west Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the pace for the Americans with two points at Samsden.
They recoup a 2&1 victory over the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball and later came back to win against Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the fours despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did a team have a come back from a four-point deficit to reach the singles, although Furyk's side only needed to hold on to the trophy.
After being second-best for two days, however, a counterattack on Sunday looked like not wanted by them.
North Korea says ‘in no case’ they would unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations at Samsden that continuing sanctions deepen the distrust of the United States and there is no way that North Korea would unilaterally disarm its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual general meeting that North Korea had shown a lot of "good will" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the Nuclear Test Site, and adding nuclear weapons and nuclear technology not to increase further.
"We don't see an equal response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust for our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves.
While Ri echoes the well-known complaint about Washington's resistance to a phased approach to denuclearization in which North Korea is rewarded for the individual steps, he emphasizes his statement in which he does not explicitly reject a unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has always done in the past.
Ri refers to a joint writing by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim negotiated a "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States so-called Pyongyang had to first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also appealed for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on the "denuclearization-first" and increases the pressure by sanctions to enforce itself in a compulsive manner, and raises objections to the "declaration of the end of war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions could force us on our knees is a dream of the people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are depriving us of our mistrust."
He did not say anything about plans for a second summit against Kim and Trump, who ahead of the U.S. leader earlier this week in front of the United Nations.
South Korea's foreign minister, Kim Jong-un, said: "If the party for denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a mess."
Just so, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's, as it sounded before the UN General Assembly that the targets on the US mainland of North Korean missiles were triggered by "Lord Devil President" Trump calling Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year on the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take the first step towards disarmament, but said that much work remains to be done and sanctions must remain until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for it, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - that's not important."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: "The implementation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue to be smoothed out and, in any case, to be implemented until we have implemented a complete, final and proven denuclearization."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea, in the hope that they will be able to counter the nuclear and ballistic missile program of Pyongyang through the weight of funds.
Pompeo met with the UN General Assembly behind the scenes and said he would return to Pyongyan next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest visit has not gone well.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that progess had been met, but within hours, North Korea had denounced him for his "gangster demands."
In a meeting with the Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex, should the Americans take "appropriate measures."
He said Kim's "appropriate measures" would require him to seek security guarantees that Trump secured in Singapore and rapprochement with normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students are encouraged to take the course.
A new court at Harvard University is leading all of its students to get more sleep and thus try to combat the growing macho culture, in which one goes through with coffee in bloom at night.
One academic found that university students, the number one in the world, often have no idea what it means to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham's women's hospital, has compiled the course, which is for them the first in the field in America.
He was inspired to start the court, after giving a four-part resolution on the influence of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of the four-year sentence, a girl came to me and asked, 'Why am I only going to find out this in my troubled year?'
He said that until now no one had told him anything about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered this year for the first time, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep habits can help academic and sporting performance, as well as a general sense of well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and manager of the university's health services, said the university had decided to offer the course after realizing that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The course, which lasts an hour, offers a range of interactive tasks.
In one part, a picture of a sleep hall is shown, where students can click on coffee bars, riddles, sports and books and then learn about the effect of caffeine and lute, but also how athletic performance is affected by sleep and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another part, those involved learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, a stroke, depression, and cancer.
A variety of the university area, with interactive icons, then encourages students to think about their daily routine.
"We don't know if it's worth changing the behavior of students directly.
But we believe that they have a right to know that – exactly how one has a right to know what health problems smoking cigarettes entails,” Prof Czeisler added.
The culture of pride that has been taught all night still exists, according to the professor, and the modern technology and the pressure on students, which is getting bigger, has as a result a lack of sleep and is a problem that is getting bigger and bigger.
He said that insuring enough quality sleep should be a kind of "secret weapon" against stress, overexertion, and fear - even to prevent one from contributing, like lack of sleep, to put one's mind in starvation, and one's feeling like one's always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, even after taking one of his courses in the latter year and his first year at Harvard.
He said that the court had opened his eyes and had inspired him to worship the whole university.
He hopes, in a next step, to get all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm for when to go to bed, but also to stand up, and pay attention to the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, and that the rhythm distributed over the day can be thrown off the runway and thus lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's goal for Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered another defeat due to Dolly Menga's goal, which downgraded Steven Gerrard's little-connected side to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's side tried to secure their first match since the 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team brought Gerrard his second-in-command's 18 games as coach and left him eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders, the Hearts.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before half-time and the line-up of the Rangers team took it to inspiration and couldn't keep up.
While the Rangers are now sliding to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, behind Hiberian by the difference in goals.
And there could be further problems approaching Rangers after Abiter Calum Spence had to be dealt a head win, due to an object that appeared to have been shot at the end of the game.
Gerrard switched sides eight times, giving him the chance to leave Ayr behind and get to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
The Holt, on the other hand, chose the same Livi 11, which cost the Hearts a point last week and he would be thrilled if his well-drilled team hit opponents here every time.
Although the Rangers had the ball more often, Livingston had more to do with the ball they had.
They could have already scored a goal two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass brought Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder pulled his big chance too far.
A deep free kick from Keaghon Jacobs to captain Craig Halkett gave Alan Lithglow in the defensive only the opportunity to shoot from afar on the post.
The Rangers were able to gain control, but it looked more like hope than faith and their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly had the feeling that he would have been in favour after a quarter hour when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but the abbot Steven Thomsen ignored the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers scored just twice in the first half, but former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly had almost no problem getting rid of Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's harmless shot.
While Livi's 34-minute start could be seen as a run against the game, no one can claim that they did not deserve it for their effort alone.
Again, the Rangers agreed to agree with a standard situation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball in between Scott Robinson, who kept a cold head and selected Menga for a simple goal.
Gerrard reacted to Coulibaly during the break against Ryan Kent, which had practically a direct impact as the ecstasy overtook Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran off the side to block.
But Livingston continued to provide visitors with exactly the type of game they loved, with Lithgow and Halkett taking one long ball after the other.
He could have taken advantage of this advantage in those annoying moments, but McGregor kept Jacobs on the bass before Lithgow shot a corner from far away.
The Rangers' Glenn Middleton had a late right to an 11-yarder when he went off with Jacobs, but Thomsen looked away again.
Almanac The inventor of the violin
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, exactly 136 years ago to the day, and still further TAUGHT ... the late physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
The violinist developed a method by which one can detect and measure radioactivity, an invention which later became known as the instrument's purpose.
The violinist, who has been a major supporter of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture. In 1950, the film "Bells of Colorado" was released with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who liked more cowboys than scientists:
Man: "What is it?"
Rogers: "This is a violin target that is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you unplug the headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms through the radioactivity and minerals."
Evans: "Well, now it's all over!"
The "Hans" violinist died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, his name is still unknown to him.
New cancer vaccine can help the immune system to detect coagulant cells
New cancer vaccine can help the immune system to detect and kill coagulant cells
Vaccination contributes to the immune system, as it can recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment.
A patient's immune cells are then taken to the lab
They can then recognize a protein that is present in many cancer cells and then re-injected
A test-vaccination shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In a woman who was treated with the vaccine that adds to the immune system to recognize malignant cells, the cancer of the ovaries disappeared after more than 18 months.
In the method, immunity cells are removed from a patient, then changed in the lab, so that they recognize a protein from many cancers, called HER2, and then the cells are injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of different types of cancer", including breast, egg, lung and intestinal cancer, as Prof Berzofsky explains.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "adding" them, such as attacking cancer cells has already worked in the treatment of some type of leukemia.
Kanye West started a pro-Trump rant, with a MAGA cap, following his appearance at SNL.
It's not going well
Kanye West was booed at the studio during Saturday Night Live, after a far-reaching performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would run for president in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, which is called Ghost Town, he wore a cape with the caption "Make America Great," stabbed against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to whites and they say, 'How do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
"If I had to deal with racism, I would have been out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the broadcast with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star joked about Brett Kavaunagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in charges of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it hasn't been broadcast, West's tirade has been uploaded through social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if the rock was trying to be fun across the West.
West also complained to the audience that he had backstage problems due to his cape.
"They've been bugging me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out like that with the cape."
They've been bugging me!
And then they said that I was sick," he said, as the Washington Examiner said.
West went on to say, "You want to see that sunny place?", following a statement that "he would wear his Superman costume, so no one can tell me what I want. You want the world to go ahead?
trying to be lewd."
His comments brought boos with them from the audience at least twice and the SNL cast looked as if it was embarrassing to them, as Variety writes, and one person told the publication: "It was totally quiet throughout the studio."
West has replaced singer Ariana Grande, who lost her husband, rapper Mac Miller, two days earlier.
The song I Love It was sung in the style of Perrier's I Love It.
West received support from Conservative group TPUSA's fourth-in-command, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "And one of the most courageous heads: Thank you for holding the bull's-eye."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply "who's gone, and that's absolutely wonderful."
"I choose to reward someone (by buying his musek or clothes or his 'art') who believes that a harmful ideology that could as well do to my community is spreading.
He's free.
"We are too," she said.
The rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "the artist formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first to change his name and so follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion and of course the later musical Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then called himself "the artist previously known as Prince."
Morduklo's attempt at knife-picking in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The case was brought before the Belfast Magistrates’ Court.
The points of the indictment are looked at by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been accused of masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's brutal fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31 years old, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen young men often give the feeling that they need to mimic the strong man in order to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the issue of harmful masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently co-starred his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31-years-old, admits that he's "rather stubborn" on the subject.
“I feel like I’m in a really, really bad mood right now – where did I go with the masculinity?” he said.
"What did we teach men when they grew up, according to the terms of the problem we see today?"
The kit believes that television is partly to blame for the rise of harmful masculinity, precisely due to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued, "What is born and what is taught?
What's on TV, and in the streets, that young men are supposed to be on the certain side of man?
I think that’s a great way to get my hands dirty – how do I do that?
There's definitely something wrong with young people."
In the interview, he also admits that he does not want to make a four- or novel story of Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, and says that he has enough of "battlefields and horses".
From November onwards, the kit is worth seeing in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story of a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor said that he found the kennel of his wife Rose the best thing that came from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in your series, so in that sense she gave me my future family, and my life from now on," he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the show of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces a rise of 14% in new cases
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV or AIDS has reached 14%.
The health experts say that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
There were 40,000 new cases reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, which marked a difference.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through various parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV along the way has been reduced to almost zero, as Chinese health experts said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From one year to the next, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate protection and den relationships.
Since 2003, China has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that maturation data leaked by GOP senators speaks of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced the Saturday rumors that a member of the Senate had published personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislatures' Wikipedia page.
The Democrat from Los Angeles has insisted that the claims of "extremely right-wing" figures and websites have been aired.
"Living, lying, and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the published information were apparently also private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information has surfaced online, uploaded by an anonymous person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservatives such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the contribution had a line to the Waters office, and they issued information about a member of the Waters' maturation team, according to lawmakers at The Hill.
"These unfounded claims are completely false and an absolute lie," Waters says.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and security and danger are the result of those dishonest and false claims - has in no case anything to do with the leaking of this information.
"This statement of support is completely false and completely false."
Waters' statements quickly attracted criticism online, including the former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is rosy," wrote the Flesher.
"It suggests that she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of doing something they didn't do, don't get angry.
Do not defy it.
Don't blame your friends and family for it.
There's got to be a calm and calm."
The Fleischer manifested himself to compare Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh's criticism of the Democrats, which was accused by critics of being angry during the impeachment proceedings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who opposes the water and the meddling, has also published his opinion on Twitter.
“Wow,” he sighed.
In a statement, Water said that the agency "has informed the appropriate authorities and those responsible for the application of the law about these false claims."
"We are confident that your guilt will come to the light of day," she continued, "and that they will be held responsible for actions here that are destructive and dangerous to everyone in my office."
Johnny English Strikes Again – Rowan Atkinson Parody
It has become a tradition to look for Brexit in all new British films now, which does not seem appropriate in this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise. This began in 2003 and was relaunched in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this kind of self-righteousness, which seems to us to be a natural consequence of this country's self-importance?
Either way, the glitzy and incompetent Johnny English with a plastic face has his certificate for a second time to spoil everything – the name of him says enough, namely that it is a wide-ranging comedy creation intended for non-English-speaking moviegoers on other territories.
He is, of course, a dumb secret agent who, although having a weird approach to idiot glamour, has a bit of a clouseau, a line from Mr Bean and a bell of the type that carried a single note to the "Chariots of Fire" lead at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It is also actually based on the traveler and international man of mystery, who once played Atkinson in the long-forgotten Barclaycart television commercials, leaving chaos everywhere.
There will be one or two good moments in this current Johnny English movie.
I was thrilled by the scene where Johnny English arrives at a helicopter, dressed in a medieval armor, while the rotating helicopter blades briefly clatter against his helmet.
Atkinson's don for physical comedy can be seen, but the humor feels "underbuttered" and comically affluent, especially wanting to offer those "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible even now with more persuasion comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's meant for kids and not adults, and to me Johnny English's dumb misadventures are just not as original and focused as Atkinson's dodgy sketches in the person of Bean.
The current reality is that the UK is facing serious challenges.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the super-secret Internet network of spies in the UK, which discovers the identities of all agents in the asylum – unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the final drop that makes the barrel overflow for the prime minister, a pompous and combative figure who already faces a total collapse of political disbelief: Emma Thompson makes her debut with this quasi Theresa-May character, but there's not much in the script there that anyone could work with.
In this case, it's a secret that every spy wants to know that they have to get out of retirement.
And that means the murmuring Johnny English and person, now employed as the school director of a distinguished establishment, who is secretly giving courses on how to become a spy: some dear jokes here, the English want to set up an Art School of Rock-sized spy school.
English was sent back to Whitehall for a brief briefing in urgency and reunited with his old lead-tested sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now mated, with a submarine commander, a sober role in which Vicki Pepperdine gets a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin are all set to return to action in the name of Majesty's Secret Service and make the acquaintance of Olga Kurylenko's Femme Fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously embroiled in a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he could solve Britain's computer problems: the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
The English and the Bough begin an odyssey of farce-evading maneuvers: dressed as waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire; they cause chaos on board Volta's luxury yacht; and the English resolves some anarchy as he tries to create a virtual reality headset to familiarise himself with the house of Volta.
All the sketches are certainly to be taken out for the latest sequence, but so friendly and burschy everything is, it already has something of children's television in the big picture.
It's pretty mediocre.
And like the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't relate to thinking: can't the British film industry give a role to Rowan Atkinson that does justice to his talent?
Labour denies they are developing a plan for Britain to launch a four-day week that will be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan, in which the British work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
The party apparently wants the heads of companies to return the savings they have gained through the revolution of artificial intelligence to the workers through an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend – but they would have been paid.
Sources say that the idea would coincide with the parties' economic agenda and also coincide with plans for the country and the worker's favor.
Switching to a four-day work week is supported by the Trades Union Congress, as a way for workers to give the advantages of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: "A review of the policy will be announced at the end of the year.
It's not worth it overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that aligns with the party's approach to rebalancing the employee's economy and favor and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to stand behind such an idea, which Green had already spoken out in the election campaign of 2017 for a four-day week.
But at the moment, this ambition is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day week is not general party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labor Conference of Blasphemy Week to celebrate his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to reassert the power of "faceless dictators" and "profits" from supplying companies.
The Chancellor also plans that current shareholders and water companies could not recover investments here, if a Labour government could demand certain "deductions" on the basis of wrong practices.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the four-tier of companies and the so-called "Inclusive Ownership" fund is to donate 10% of the profit of companies in the private sector to workers, who could then receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, the John Kennedy "60 Minutes" whether Kavanaugh's investigation here could change opinions
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a lenient vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the Bureau's (FBI) findings could convince Republican senators to give their support to him.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find out anything new that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his workmate from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"As I entered the audience, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, this accusation came out, and really said, "Did you do that?"
"He was determined, determined, determined."
But Graham's voice seems to be written in stone.
"My view on Brett Kavanaugh is solid and there should be a particularly strong accusation coming in to change them," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: The board vehemently disputed it," Graham said in the context of Christine Blasey Ford.
"All the people you call can't be trusted.
It's 36 years here.
I don't see anything that could change the situation."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This summer in New York, the Global Citizen Festival is once again taking place, an annual muséksévénement that has an immensely impressive line-up of stars who perform, but has an equally impressive mission: to end poverty all over the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival is worth attracting thousands of people to Central Park's "Great Lawn" to see not only such musical acts as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to pay attention to the event's true goal, i.e. the ending of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international NGO that fights poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket), people who attend the concert need to complete a number of tasks, or "actions", such as working as a volunteer, writing an email to a leader in the world, calling someone, or other tasks that help end the goal, poverty.
But how much success has Global Citizen, with only 12 years left to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, an honest way of demanding that people take action or another case of "clickivism" - people who might bring them a real change by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says they have registered more than 11 million "actions" of their supporters since 2011, targeting different targets.
They say the actions have helped them lead global leaders to announce commitments and unlock policies worth more than $37 billion, which will lift more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 engagements and notifications coming from these actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or collected.
The group estimates that the money collected so far had an impact on nearly 649 million people in the world.
One of the main commitments is, among others, The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and adopters committed to "helping children live their full potential," and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to subsidize the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can address social injustice from malnutrition to a foothold in history," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience at the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that more than 5000 actions have been addressed to the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, and that the government has announced the financial support of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach more than 5 million women and children with nutritional support.
To the answer of a FAQ on the website, which asks "what makes you think that you can end extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen responded: “It’s worth giving a long and hard way – sometimes falling and failing me.
But, as all the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements in front of us, we value success, we want to be stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are just some of the artists who will be performing in New York this year, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The US could use a Navy blockade to restrict Russian energy exports – Interior Minister
Washington said "if necessary" they would use Navy here to stop Russian energy from coming to the marchees, including in the Middle East, when U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told reporters, citing the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that the engagement of Russia and Syria – where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government – would only be a four-way street to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that they want to be in the Middle East, just like in Eastern Europe and there in the southern part of Europe, to transmit energy," he apparently said.
And if anyone can believe him, there is always a way to do so.
"The American States of America have the opportunity, with our Navy, to make sure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to block to make sure that energy is not entering the market," he said.
De Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance – an American NGO that sees itself as “the voice of the energy consumer”.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that in the end, they were the same.
"The economic options for Iran and Russia are turning, more or less, upside down to exert pressure and replenish fuel," he said, while in context, Russia is viewed as an economy that is totally dependent on fossil energy.
The claims come as the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of natural liquid gas to Europe in order to remake Russia, which is a significantly more promising option for European consumers.
To this effect, employees of the Trump administration, and Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which – if you listen to Trump – would make Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has often claimed that the 11-billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is some economic project.
The Kremlin claims that the vehement opposition to the Washington project is simply driven by economic reasons and that would be an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means to exert pressure and that it should be possible for consumers to decide on their providers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. has repeatedly criticized Germany's decision to withdraw from the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), the main German industrial organisation, has asked the United States to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is worth "good looking" whether she will run for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator said
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren told the crowd that she would "look good" if she went to the races for the presidency after the midterms.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"I'm looking forward to seeing if I can run for president on November 6th."
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the event, saying that he would "lead the country into a wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump will do to our democracy," she said.
Trump has been criticized by Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before being elected."
It's been a long time coming, but it's clear that Warren's own election doesn't mean he won't be running for president in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, eighty-five percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters are of the opinion that they should not disagree.
Thirty-two percent found it to be a good idea.
The study showed that there is more support there for the governor of vidrun, Deval Patrick, with eighty-five percent who are in favor of him joining and forty-five percent who are against it.
Other Democratic nominees of high profile named in the context of the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide to retire by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks about Palin's PTSD at a Donald Trump event
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after he enrolled in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son is going through, what is going through him since he is back home, I can sympathize with other families who are struggling with PTSD ramifications, and with the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with," she told an audience at an event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Calling his festname "the elephant in the room," Palin said that her son and other veterans "are coming back a little differently, they're getting faster, they're coming back and wondering if there's any respect for what the other soldiers and pilots, and any other member of the military, have been doing."
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic assault against a woman, which together led to the report into general domestic violence and possession of a weapon in the drunken state, according to Dann Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support defiance for new asylum policy
Sixteen states in the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy prohibiting victims of gang violence or domestic violence from seeking asylum.
Representatives from 18 states in the district have entered a memorial "amicus curiae" ("ami de la cour") in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge the policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal politics has not been publicly filed.
She said that her partners "and his violent build-ups, which are gang members," they had abused, but U.S. officials had denied applications for asylum here on July 20.
She was stationed in Texas.
The states here that support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which come a large number of requests for U.S. asylum, as nations that have constant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy amended a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that gave undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence the opportunity to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, attorney general of the District of Columbia, said in a statement that the new policy would "ignore constitutional law, federal law, and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum seekers be granted the facts and circumstances of the application, and such a court goes against the principle," says the "ami de la cour".
Affects continue to argue in the memoir that the policy would not allow immigrants to enter, which would harm the U.S. economy, they would likely want to become entrepreneurs, and a "major offering of laborers."
Avocat General Jeff Sessions in June demanded that judges grant asylum to victims who want to escape domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is possible for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on their race, religion, nationality or if they want to be a member of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said on June 11 in his presentation of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of dead doubled compared to the survivors
As a result, the situation became more and more difficult for the survivors.
"It all feels tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while trying to calm her little sister Bébé at the evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute there's an ambulance coming in.
There's almost no clean water."
Uwunners were seen returning to destroyed highs here by looking through wet properties to be able to save whatever.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospital, damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has a fractured back and shoulder, were outside outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were being treated for the unending nods outside.
When he told of the feeling when it was on the 5th floor in the hotel room that he shared with his wife and his daughter, experiencing a brutal earthquake, he received tears in his eyes.
"There was no time to save us.
I've been quelled into the ruins of the walls, I suppose," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what's going on here or my son.
I hope they are safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement praising the beneficers of opposite U.S.-China commerce in a U.S. daily, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press for propaganda purposes.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China’s paid advertising in the Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best-selling newspaper – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, which China opposes.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in U.S. elections is a new phase of Washington's escalation campaign to pressure China, according to a U.S. official.
While it's normal for foreign governors to publish advertising for commerce, Beijing and Washington are facing a dissuasive trade war, which has led to higher tariffs being charged on the other's imports.
The retaliatory tariffs of China at the beginning of the trade war were meant to meet exporters such as Iowa – who support Trump’s Republican Party – such Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa – an important agricultural export state to China – says Beijing wants American workers, farmers and businesses as much as it does.
China, as Branstad wrote in an article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "is now ready to lend a helping hand by putting propaganda advertisements in our free press."
By spreading propaganda, the government of China goes against the cherished and long-standing tradition of freedom of speech and the free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper stand at the bottom of the street of Beijing, there is little opposition vote and no real reflection of different opinions that the Chinese could have against the economic development of their country, wants to control the media of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also said that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers didn't want to print his article," though he didn't know how much.
The Republican Party's response to Kavanaugh's debacle over women's rights, analysts warn.
While many top Republicans are behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and have gone on to defend against various claims of sexual violence, analysts have warned of a counter-action in the interim, especially by women.
The sentiments surrounding the subject were extremely high and most Republicans said they would like to move forward with the vote.
"Such things can't be rolled back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, who spoke to The Hill for an article published Sunday.
The rower said that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute push to have an FBI investigation is only worth angry voters.
"Women don't value forgetting what happened yesterday - they don't forget it either in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national porte-parole for the progressive group MoveOn, the Freiden, if you can believe a Washington D.C. newspaper.
Protesters chanted "November is coming!" while Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to a mic report.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are extremely valuable," Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
"The people were already high; that's true.
But it could go even higher, especially among so-called female "swing voters", and the four-city and young voters, 18-29-year-olds, who - although they did not like the president - often do not vote.
Even prior to Ford's public testimony, in which they filed an accurate description of the sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggest that it might backfire if Republicans continue to go along with the confirmation.
"That's a confusing mess for the GOP," said Micheal Steele, former Republican National Committee four-in-hand, at the start of the week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the committee vote or the deleterious vote or whether Kavanaugh will be the judge, it's also a question of how the Republicans handled the whole thing and how they treated them," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, said in a statement.
But Americans seem to be somewhat divisive about what to believe from Ford's and Kavanaugh's statements, although there is a tendency to believe the latter more.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or possibly believe Ford's statement, while 35 percent say they definitely believe Kavanaugh.
And 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his statement, while only 30 percent said the same about the Ford.
After pressure from the Flake, the FBI is now in the process of investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, as The Guardian wrote.
Ford had sworn in before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had abused her in a drunken state at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominees at a party exposed his genitals.
The creator of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide where data is stored here and who may have access to water information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that his intention behind Inrupt was “the world domination”.
"We've got to do it," he said of the start-up.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to set up their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can bring together contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all work together on one browser, and that's all the time.
What is unique about the "personal online data store" is that it is completely dependent on the user to whom an information can have access.
The company calls it "personal emancipation through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to bring resources, process qualifications, and apply for such solid access to everyone.
The company currently consists of the Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a few maturities working as developers on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized app with the tools that can be found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not talk to Facebook or Google, whether or not they should introduce a complete change where all business models are turned on their heads overnight.
"We're not asking permission here."
In a post published on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to deliver commercial energy to an eco-system that values the integrity and quality of the new web at Solid Protect."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even though an inrupt has been established, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic for the new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: 1st World War II Pastor Celebrated with "Victoria Cross"
The only clergyman from the Church of England who ever received a "Victoria cross" as a fighter during World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Order on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglyse and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper for four days and never claimed to have been awarded the highest British military honours.
A commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "genius symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after the action of his bop, which earned him the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick fog and under attack on the field and by machine guns."
He later ran to the firing line and rejoined the battalion before taking a field weapon with one hand and surrendering three of the military units.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said he "couldn't do justice to his grandfather's actions, but it was a depressing experience."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade on which the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band led.
Michael Vann says that he "feels very honored to be a part of the parade" and also said that "the courage of a real hero is demonstrated by the support of many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206 and instead got Peppa Pig
Imagine this: You stayed up all night to watch a packed Bellator 206, only to be denied the sight of the main event then.
On the schedule stood 13 fights from San Jose, including six on the main map and they were shown on Channel 5 all night live in the United Kingdom.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just as Guard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to oppose each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were stunned when the coverage of Peppa Pig changed.
Some were unimpressed after they had been extra vigilant for the fight until the early hours of the morning hours.
One fan described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's a government rule that at 6 a.m. that content wasn't appropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program," said David Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communications, as he was approached about the transfer.
"Peppa the pig", jo."
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they wanted to revise their schedules to include viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think when I think about the replay, I think we can probably do that," Coker said.
"But it's 6 o'clock in the morning Sunday there and we're not able to fix this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're going to make it.
Believe me, when it was switched over, many messages were sent in here, and they were all not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical disorder.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a problem.
I can assure you, this will not happen again.
We reduced the fights to 5 instead of 6 – as we always do – and we tried to deliver the catch more, but we messed it up.
It's a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has felt "minor" at sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he had grown up with the feeling of being inferior to anyone because of his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he came to secondary school that "not everybody is like me".
Speaking to the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had been talking about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that he wanted to be a part of the team that would help him win the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to an illness.
In her appearance as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less worthy of being" than anyone else when growing up, because "it was socially unacceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, the feelings, less worth and different to feel, are the only things that have given us the strength and perseverance to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "worth something," he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone if they eventually figured out his sexual preferences.
The two-time bronze medalist at the Olympics is one of the most well-known LGBT advocates and he took advantage of his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, calling for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he was addressing this because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and without consequences and want to make others "hope."
The three-time world champion has said that falling in love with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When someone so young, so many went through" - he participated in his first Olympiad at the age of 1 and his father died three years later from cancer - he said that it was difficult to find someone as old as he went through the same heights and depths.
The couple became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything was about 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know what; there are more important things like Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley said his father would not have accepted that he would die and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had their tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not there to sit in the first row,'" he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and it was only when he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he wasn't invisible," he said.
The following year, Daley joined the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I only knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a gathering of people at home at the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – Proud of Heather Small – which he played in the background, as he prepared for the Olympic Games and always caused a headache with him.
Desert Island Discs is Sunday at 11:15 BST on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson's performance at the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to regain his form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a 12th record at the event every 2 years, was sent to the bench by captain Jim Furyk for four balls and four on Saturday.
Instead of standing at the center of the action, as he has done so many times for the United States, the five-time main winner has spent his day playing cheerleaders and working on the range at his game, hoping to improve what he plots.
Not even at the peak of his career, he was the loudest driver, and that's why the 48-year-old player is not the ideal cast for the tight buns of Le Golf National, where the long Rough routinely fails to punish shots.
And if the ties aren't daunting enough in themselves, Mickelson will meet British Open champion Francesco Molinari on Sunday in the ninth game, who will form a team with starter Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans with four points behind start the 12 individual games have a difficult start, then Mickelson's match could prove to be absolutely important.
Furyk has expressed confidence in his husband, it's just that he can't say anything else.
"He fully understood his role for today, patted me on the back, put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a strong self-confidence.
He's on the team and he's been on the team for the past week and he's been on the team for the past two seasons.
I didn't expect him to play two matches.
I've been thinking about it before, but it worked and I think we need to do it.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
Mickelson broke Nick Faldo's record for most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It could represent the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never really reached the high points of its personal record.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 lost games and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought far more intangible benefits to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, capricious, likes to make fun of others and he's a wonderful person who likes someone in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun when they were on the road with him, and also this week, which was fun watching.
He's more than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great lead can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a fairly large lead for the individual last day in the Ryder Cup can turn into an uncomfortable ride very quickly.
Dan made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but just won it by a margin of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You always remember that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but also just barely," Bjorn said, bouncing off after taking the class of 2018 despite seeing a Friday and yesterday's win with 5:3.
The story will show me and everyone in this team that this is not over yet.
Go for everything.
Get out there and do everything right.
This is not over until you see points on the board.
We have a goal and that is to try to win this trophy, and that is what we must continue to focus on.
I've been saying it all along, I'm focusing on the 12 games that are on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side - the best players in the world."
Relieved when his players hit a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never put myself in the forefront.
Tomorrow, we'll have another one ahead of us.
It's one of those things that's going to happen tomorrow, and that's a different story.
It's great to be out with a partner when things are going well, but if you're out on your own, you'll be tested as a golfer to the point of bloodshed.
That's the message you need to convey to the player: Get your best tomorrow.
Let your partner back and he must now go his way and also be his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, wants his players to beat each other better than they did as a partner, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four points.
Furyk himself knows both sides of those big turns because he was part of the winning team at Brookline before they went off the pitch as a loser because Europe played out the "miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in response to the question, as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important players tomorrow, but you'd like to make the quick start you've seen at Brookline, you've seen at Medinah.
If the pendulum swings in one direction, then a lot of pressure is exerted on the middle players.
"We've made it clear that we've made the right decision and we've made it clear that we're going to be able to do it tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to tackle the opposition and faces Rory McIlroy in the lead, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans on the other half of the line-up.
"I chose this line because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said of his individual selections.
Germany's new warship, Hanne, has been laid off again.
The newest frigate of the German Navy was commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will not be completed, according to local media, due to faulty systems and ever-greater costs before at least the next year.
The order for the "Rhineland-Palatinate," the main ship of the frigate class Baden-Württemberg, has now been postponed, according to the newspaper "Die Zeit", which a military spokesman cites, until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the distressing problems after delivery have taken home the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-class, which the Navy ordered back in 2007, are intended as replacements for the aging frigates of the Bremen-class.
They have an impact-resistant gun, a host of flight and naval missiles, as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible that the newest frigate will not run into the home for up to two years.
But the constant delays mean that for the innovative warships – which are supposed to prove Germany’s decisiveness in overseas affairs – they are already obsolete before they even perform the service, notes “Die Zeit”.
The F125 frigate, tracked by Ongluck, made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media called a number of critical "software and hardware defects" through which the ship would have been rendered useless in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class were operated by a crew of almost 120 sailors – almost half of the personnel of the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It also turned out that the ship has too much weight, which reduces its performance and the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
The 7,000 tons heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the German during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project – including the training of the team – also becomes a problem.
It is estimated that it has already reached an astonishing €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – of originally €2.2 billion.
The problems with the newest frigates are especially important due to recent warnings that the German naval forces are failing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the navy was "spending the most valuable ships".
Officials said the problem had worsened over time, as old ships were being stolen, but no new ships were being prepared.
He claimed that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to join the navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of Flantermais
A new research conducted on a plot in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how Flantermais use the landscape on their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed a new light on the behaviour of the unique flight mammals and, in addition, help establish guidelines for future protective activities.
The study is being carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland and is tracking common and mosquito fly maize but also brown langue and daubenton fly maize at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are placed on important locations around the plot, in order to monitor the fluttering activities throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers also perform mobile recording using hand-held detectors.
In-depth expert analysis of all records determine the frequency of fluency and what kind of does it.
A map and a habitat report are then produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the flounder maize and how they are used by each species.
This information helps to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of wise and how forest areas are best managed for floundering and other similar species.
The population of the Flandermaus has declined significantly in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom in the last century.
They are threatened by buildings and development work that impact on sleeping areas and a loss of living space.
Wind chimes and lightning can also pose a risk, just like paint stains and chemical treatments of building materials, but also attack of house cats.
The blinds aren't really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to the trappings of prey animals.
They use a highly developed echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the flight of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes flannel maize very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who perform regular admissions, sleep inspection and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated flanthermaus reserve in Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, providing a habitat for eight of Scotland's ten flanthermaus species.
David Thompson, the land manager, says that the plot is the ideal landscape for it.
"Here in Threave we have a wonderful area for flanter maize," he said.
"We have the old buildings, in front of the trees and the wonderful habitat.
But there's a lot we don't yet know about Flanthermais, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere helps us better understand what they need to be able to unfold."
He highlighted the importance of looking for flannel corn before carrying out maintenance on land, as an unknowable destruction of a single rearing habitat could kill up to 400 females and young flannel corn, potentially eradicating a very local population.
Flantermais are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their living spaces.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish person in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to step in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about butterflies and for many of our species we simply don't know how their populations are going to fare."
Ronaldo has been accused of raping a German journalist, according to his lawyer.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charge against him a "false report" by saying that people "want to make themselves known" by using it's name.
His lawyers want to denounce the German news magazine "Der Spiegel," which has published the false claims.
Portugal's Juventus striker has been charged with raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in a Las Vegas hotel room.
It is alleged that he had paid $375,000 to avoid bringing the incident to public attention, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
As he spoke hours after being reported on the allegations, in an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the reports as "false reports."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today is false news," said the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"She wanted to advertise for herself, by using my name.
- That's normal.
They want to be known by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy and very good man," the player added with a laugh.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to denounce the "Der Spiegel" for the false accusations, which they call "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player wants to claim compensation for “moral damages at an amount that corresponds to the severity of the violation, which will be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room where he had, according to documents from the files of the Clark County District Court in Nevada allegedly anally raped.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" and "good guy" apart from the "nine percent".
The documents claim Ronaldo had confirmed that the two had had sex, but that it had taken place with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that had gone to the police and that had photos of his injuries that had been taken in the hospital, but had later agreed to solve the case <0xC3><0xA0> l'amiable, because she "had great fear of retaliation" and was afraid to be "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman said she would now try to lift the union because she is still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of switching from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged breach and this summer he signed a 100-million-dollar deal with Italian club Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom 'would be prepared to lose it forever' car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would be eternally ready" if it lost its status as the world's leading automaker, said Secretary of the Economy Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily suspend production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the effects of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston – where Toyota Auris and Avensis are produced – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK drops out of the EU by the end of March, production in our factory will be halted," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other carmakers from the United Kingdom have also raised concerns about the EU's leaving without an agreement on how cross-border trade should work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main considerations are related to what, according to car manufacturers, supply chain risks are in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line will be "completely synchronised," with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and from the EU for cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be a disruption at the border that could lead to delays and closures at parts, according to the industry.
It would then be impossible for Toyota to keep a stock of more than one day at the factory in Derbyshire, the company said, thereby halting production.
Mr Clark told Theresa May her Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid border reviews.”
"We absolutely need a deal. We want the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy success now, but also to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 programme Today.
"The statement not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we must necessarily be able to demonstrate what has been an extremely successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the long run they warned that the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and end up costing jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the union chairman of Unite and the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "From experience I can say that if these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have worked out a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be rescheduled, according to the White House
Donald Trump's controversial meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "a further week after Hanne shifted," because the fight for the candidate Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Federal Court still persists, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, who, in the event of possible interference by the Russians in elections, is investigating connections between Trump supporters and Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump kicked out the deputy justice minister and thereby puts Mueller's independence in the game has been the number one topic of conversation for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the "New York Times" reported that Rosenstein had spoken about being ousted in order to record talks with Trump and about the possibility of deposing the president over the 25th Amendment article.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But in the meantime, he went into the White House and, according to reports, he was about to get into it.
A meeting with Trump, who was in New York at the time, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not "get out" of Rosenstein, but he was lobbied to avoid an overlap with the Senate Judiciary Committee's ruling, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, whom he accused of sexual misconduct, both singled out.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation into a week of allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying an entire Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she replied: "There has not yet been a date set for this, it could be this week, it could also be that I have to hand it over for another week, with all the other things that have gone on in the Supreme Federal Court.
But I've always loved it, and I've always loved it."
Some reporters questioned the claim: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace has asked.
Sanders felt that the lack of information channels did not arise from an aversion to television reporters who were out for "effect-hashing", even though she admitted: "I don't dispute the fact that they do effect-hashing".
He said he would continue to be in direct contact with the Trump administration.
“The president holds more R&D meetings than any president before him,” she said, adding without proof: “We have looked at the numbers.”
Information rounds are still taking place, Sanders said, but "but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president, then that's definitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do that a lot and you have seen that we have done a lot in the last few weeks, and that will replace a press briefing in the future if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or attends press conferences.
The press conferences are unique.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why by putting up a sloppy and heinous bizarre appearance in front of the assembled reporters.
The Minister of Health calls on EU employees at NHS Scotland due to Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff of the Scottish NHS (State Health Service) to express the country's gratitude and wish that they stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of an application for a regulated status for EU citizens who work in its delegated public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "The summer of the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the exit progressed and it is heading towards expected decisions for this fall.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also increased its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is going to be a difficult time for all of you.
That's why I now want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to stay."
Nootropics for Christion Abercrombie without head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie suffered a head injury following a 31:27 defeat against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessean Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened just before half-time.
"He came to the sidelines and collapsed there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff administered oxygen to the abercrombie on the sideburn and placed him on a beer and brought him back for further judgement.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left Vanderbilt Medical Center's OR.
Harris added that there is "no detail as to the nature/extent of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
This is Abercrombie, a fellow athlete in the 2nd year, his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season to a total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty if they buy a piece of land in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp costs if they buy a piece of land in the United Kingdom, using the additional tax under the Tory Plan to help the homeless.
The step neutralizes the success of Corbyn's action to attract young voters
The tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The finance ministry experts expect them to climb to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp costs if they buy a piece of land in the United Kingdom, using the additional tax under the Tory Plan to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's action, attract young voters with promises, provide more affordable housing, and target well-wishers.
The stamp tax increase will be imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, while the additional money will strengthen the government's fight against sleeping on the streets.
The additional tax – which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second-residents and coffee-to-leave houses – could amount to up to three percent.
Financial experts expect the step to be worth <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-United Kingdom citizens, driving prices to the sky and making it difficult for first-time buyers to walk in residential construction.
Many rich areas in the country – especially in the capital – have become “cities of spirit” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new guidelines come just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp tax to help younger people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping land prices high by buying land but not using it, and he urged Ms. May to give up quotas on affordable homes to rein in Britain's "wohnzoumudung."
Mr Corbyn has announced a conspicuous spate of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to compulsory evictions "without forfeiture".
He also wants to give more powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would use my term as Prime Minister to revive the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means recharging the battery.
Britain is always open to people who live here, work and want to build a life.
It may not be true that it is appropriate for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, and also for foreign companies, to purchase housing such as British citizenship.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away and the decline of sleeping on the road remains far too real."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "biggest ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
Schott, 42, is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is just in third place in League One, three points away from the top.
He moved into the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership (1st League of Scotland) last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I got a B-cap and that was all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sports Sound.
"But I grew up by watching a lot of Scotland games as a kid with my dad in Hampden and that's something that always drew me back.
"I'm going to have a chance to win if I'm in the club."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not afraid to pursue such established names at such a large club, having previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"I'm going to ask the question, 'Can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and equipment at this club, there is no doubt that it belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I would consider myself successful here only if I could return to the club there."
Ross has only three years' experience as a manager, after a time as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months at Hearts' coaching staff.
Then, he helped Alloa recover from being relegated to the third league and transformed St Mirren from being a rookie candidate to the championship title winner in the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a real divorce," he recalls as he took over Alloa.
"I really felt that the administration was the right thing for me to do even more than play.
It sounds strange, but I have beaten myself well, can live well from it and have enjoyed some justified high points.
But it can make sense.
There's a lot of stuff that needs to be done every week.
I still do this as a stress and pressure through work, but the administration just feels right.
I always wanted to manage and now that I'm doing it, it feels like the best thing I've done in my entire life as an adult."

The perfect time for a pint is according to a study Sunday at 5:30
The heatwave of the summer increased the rescue of the British pubs fighting for survival, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The pub and bar groups experienced an increase of 2.7 percent in July – but the revenue in restaurants declined 4.8 percent, as the numbers prove.
Peter Martin of the consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "Unprecedented sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup has resulted in July following a similar pattern as June, when pubs had 2.8 percent more turnover, except that restaurants have even more turnover.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restoration in June worsened even further in July.
The bars and pubs in which they were drunk were cut down far more severely than the restaurants had gone out of business.
It's also a great place to eat in the sun, even if it's not as hot as the sun.
It's like people just want to drink.
In all pubs and bars managed, the sales of drinks went up by 6.6 percent in the same month, while in the case of food they were down by three percent."
Paul Newman of leisure and hotel industry analyst RSM said: "The results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales on the out-of-home market.
It's not surprising that restaurant group continues to struggle, but a sales drop of 4.8 percent year-on-year is in addition to the ongoing cost drop especially as.
The long extremely hot summer couldn't have come a worse time for operators in the food industry and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring such urgent expected temperatures."
In July, sales in all pubs and restaurants, including re-openings, rose by 2.7 percent, which also reflected the slowdown in brand re-openings.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One of five children – part of whom is just 11 – has secret social media accounts, according to a survey, which they hide from their parents and teachers
The survey of 20,000 secondary school children revealed a crackdown on "false insta" pages
The news was driven by the fear that sexual content would be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main account" that they showed to their parents
E of five children – part of which is just 11 – sheep social media accounts, which they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school children revealed a rapid rise in “false Instagram” accounts – a play on the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has driven the fear that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they would operate a low-key "main account" that they would show their parents while they also had a private one.
A mother who came across the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who called out, “rape me.”
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistress' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11 to 18 year olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to operating private accounts.
Head of HMC Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online areas where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes 'speaker of the athletes' on the Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Annual General Meeting of the Supervisory Board as a Supervisory Board member in the Scottish Athletics squad.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated light athlete and chairman Ian Beattie saw the move as a significant opportunity for those who practice the sport to take advantage of their wide-ranging experience at the international level over the last decade.
"The Eilidh enjoys immense respect in the athletics community across Scotland, the United Kingdom and around the world and we are sure that Scotland's athletics would benefit greatly if we had to take the shot," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I'm delighted to be acting as a voice agent for the athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and holds a total of 4 Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC expert, can no longer walk after having suffered a transitory ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "In front of a mountain, I had a stroke.
- I couldn't go.
The doctors said, only by the time it turns out, to what extent I recover.
It was hard work, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and today I do mobility exercises!
Thanks for the reminders!"
In order to get the most out of the squids that are online, the squids
A company for milk pumps has launched online with an advertisement that compares milking mothers to cows that are slaughtered, stirring up the media.
For the launch of the so-called "first worldwide unobtrusive portable milk pump", the company for consumer technology Elvie has released a non-serious music-video-inspired advertisement to highlight the freedom that mothers - who pump off milk - enjoy with the new pump.
Four real mothers dance in a house-filled stall to a music that contains the following lyrics: "Yes, I stroke myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you didn't notice it, these are not shoes, that are my bristles."
The chorus continues: "I'm going to feed my babies, I'm going to feed my babies, I'm going to feed my babies, I'm going to beat my ladies."
However, the ad published on the company's Facebook page sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video triggered mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom say it highlights the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use this product.
Just like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their infants are removed a few days after birth," he wrote.

Another commented: "Considerably traumatic for the mother as well as for the baby.
"Why don't you use a baby shower to wash your hands?"
Another added, "It's such a distasteful advertisement."
Others defended the ad, while a mother admitted that she found the song "immensely weird."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I still had one.
I felt like I was on the edge of a cliff.
It's a little crazy, but I understand how it feels.
This is a brilliant product," he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad that targets moms who pump off (often on their work or the toilets) and feel like "cheating."
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pompoms placed in their seats.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
Elvie's pump, however, is very inconspicuous, has no wires or strokes, and discreetly fits into a stool and thus offers women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even go out during the pumping off.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at "Mother" commented: "Elvie's pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative introduction.
By drawing a parallel, between pumping mothers and milk cows, we wanted to highlight the pumping of milk and the associated challenges and at the same time demonstrate in an entertaining and tangible way.
This isn't the first time Ellie's voice has been heard.
During London Fashion Week, a two-time mother for designer Marta Jakubowski walked the catwalk while she was wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently relocated to a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has reached a peak, although the possible border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric of the Trump administration and the guidelines it has adopted have made it difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and were afraid of their own opportunity to stay in the country, to play the game, by signing up to adopt a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal agencies announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to hand over fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the migrant agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of children from people who had volunteered to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been pre-punished.
"Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large proportion of those are criminal aliens.
“I’m going to go with the flow,” said Mr. Albin.
While trying to get the children to work faster, officials, according to accommodation employees, introduced new rules, whereby some of them had to appear in court within a month after the arrest, instead of after 60 days (the previous standard).
Many appear via video conferencing instead of in person to present their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who don't qualify for help are quickly evicted.
What keeps children in detention longer, what makes them more likely to become anxious and depressed, which, according to shelter staff and reports released from the system in recent months, can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts.
Lawyers have indicated that these concerns are being exacerbated in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that the signs due to facility size will be overlooked that a child is struggling with them.
They added that the abandonment of children to the tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could worsen the trauma they are struggling with.
Syria demands that the United States, France and Turkey immediately withdraw their "occupation"
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Al-Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces are illegally staying on Syrian soil under the pretext of counter-terrorism and are "perceived accordingly with them".
“They have to withdraw immediately and without conditions,” he told the assembly.
Al-Moualem insisted that the "war on terror in Syria is as good as over," where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have lost their homes.
He said that Damascus continues to fight its "holy fight until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presences."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, training and advising mainly Kurdish forces in Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, al-Moualem said that the terms were in order for them to return and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that urged refugees to stay away.
“We have committed ourselves to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return,” he said.
"It's a political issue that's just a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no build-up aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to push ahead with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Al-Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action would take jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra front, to the sights that would be "exploited."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members will soon come together to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Al-Moualem placed conditions for the participation of the Syrian government on the committee, saying that the work of the council should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump won a second term in office
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the New Zealand elections in 2020, unless, how many liberal viewers are likely to hope, an impeachment or a scandal would prematurely end his presidency.
"It's the most dramatic end of a presidency that has ever happened."
But so far, there are no signs of intervention by the spectators.
Since 2014, the ratings at CNN's main broadcast times have doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled at MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped the cable quota with no less than 3.5 million viewers at prime time nights.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, head of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has a different theory.
I remember a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
Chaffer told him that he would vote for Lord Trump.
Why? he asked.
He replied "Because he makes me laugh," Mme. Scovell told me.
In the chaos, there's chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, the actions of the White House could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will come together again and the health of the global economy.
This is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.

It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees a cash flow, thanks to the redistricting of congressional districts, which received two incumbents in a race for the same seat.
This newly-drawn suburb of Pittsburg is to the detriment of the Democrat representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in a solar election last spring in another district.
Lamb takes on another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who will cross with the new 17th.
The maps were drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th set off a bargain for campaign funding between the main funding arm, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name after a narrow victory in a much-observed solar election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
It was held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians have given the Democrats a lead.
The U.S. has tried to punish El Salvador for its support of China, but has refused to do so.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with no major opposition from the United States.
Mr. Trump had a warm-hearted meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to revoke American leaders from their diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the ministry, said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only straw measures were tested against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which curtail financial aid payments and target visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rate.
With progress at internal meetings, the functionaries of North and Central America have postponed a high-level conference with an emphasis on security and economic prosperity, to follow up on a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to repatriate migrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, leading officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be preempted and they effectively ended all considerations for streamlining measures for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is due to host the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, as a signal for the import that the administration is set to meet, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new suspicious news or punishment from Washington.
A representative spokesman for the White House for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate, which was attended by the three American residents, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who works closely with the administration and who also spoke about the conditions of anonymity.
Let's learn history
Your next job message could be special investigator Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible legal disability, about which there is now considerable evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller, as reported, also wants to find out with his investigation on Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia on the attack on our elections.
If Congress is to be re-assessed, then Mr. Trump will have to show responsibility before the new composition, shortly before he has to show himself to the electorate again, and perhaps even to a jury of his colleagues.
There are many conditions, and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s demise is inevitable – or that of his European equivalents.
We must all make decisions on the two sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the length of this dispute.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if the West had only resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that resulted from it.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, in which democracy's merciless march is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently facing some of these turning points.
What do we do when Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who steers the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that he suggested last year that he secretly picked up the president and speculated that he is not for his post.
Mr. Rosenstein says the report from The Times is flawed.
"What will our reaction be if the newly demanded F.B.I. investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is sworn in to the Supreme Court, even if there are credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest statements against him?
And, first of all, are we going to vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we don't do the right thing, then we will have a hard time with democracy.
But I don't think we will fail because of a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jewess who was of the same Nazi regime who once occupied my embassy home and was deported to Auschwitz.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me away to start up Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
With that in my inheritance, why shouldn't I be an optimist about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna fight
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday is aware that the victory against the Austrians, having played impressively against Villarreal this month in Spain, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first match of the season since the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve better things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the belief that we would get something and they came home with a point.
I would have liked to have been able to see it in the end, but overall, it's probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were in the second half the better side.
It's a great European night again.
Hopefully we can get three points but this will be a difficult match because they had a good result in their last match but, with the spectators on our side, I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself but it feels like someone is doing well now.
The squad is good and the boys all have a lot of fun; the training is good.
Let's hope that we can move forward and be successful in the coming season."

Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to members of their family about it.
About half of the individuals in this nationwide study said they would talk to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a member of their family, but they don't take the steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance company.
That's how one goes.
Talk to your partner and children: You can't prepare your family to care for you if you don't make your wishes known early enough.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices play an important role in calculating costs.
Involve your financial advisors: Your advisor can also help you find an opportunity to pay the costs.
Your choices to pay for your long-term care include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash value life insurance to help cover costs, or self-insurance with your own wealth – as long as you have the money.
Let's talk about your rights: Conflicts of Interest
Establish a health insurance policy so that a person can trust your health care provider and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in the event that they are unable to communicate.
You also have the power to control your finances.
You'll want to trust a person to make your financial decisions and ensure that the invoices are paid in case you're unable to.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your elderly parent had a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Will you be able to respond to questions about medications and allergies?
List the details in a written plan so that you are prepared.

Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died during a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian state of Palu Friday, with the expectation that the number of dead will rise.
Since the communication possibilities collapsed, the official aid could not provide information from the Donggala Regency, an area in the north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, which is at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was about to celebrate its 40th birthday when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching over more than 300km (180 miles) from the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, an administrative region under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nile mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have often been hit by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to information from the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggalam Lake killed 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
A tsunami hit the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is a landlocked country and is hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of the last year:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong gusts struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 strength hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that slammed into the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 strong quake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
About 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake struck one of the Menawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial quake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh and triggered destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the deadly quake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the tsunami.
2018: Major quakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaksa and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was convicted of soup<0xC3><0xA7>on of domestic violence, impeachment of a domestic violence report, and of resisting arrest, according to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the suspected crimes, he removed the phone from him.
Palin is in pretrial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured bill of $500, KTUU reports.
He was a Saturday in court, where he declared that he was "certainly not guilty" when asked about the debt, the broadcaster said.
Palin faces three class-A offenses, which means he could go to prison for a year and receive a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B offense, punishable by a roof in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the suspected attack.
The case is currently before the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, receiving a report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a gun while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had been hit in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 for seeing her son's violent behavior and connection to PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication networks are out and it is expected that the number of the dead will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck a short distance from the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
It circulates videos on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu as the tsunami hit the shores.
Federal prosecutors want rare death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack who killed eight people - a rare penalty that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out the attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, and took pedestrians and cyclists who were in his way overrun in Oct.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "wanted" to kill eight people and caused "wanted" serious physical harm, following the declaration of intent to demand the death penalty, filed by the Southern District of New York.
The two defendants may face a death sentence, according to a court filing.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 charges, which included eight murder charges to aid in extortion of protective funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack used "essential planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "cruel, resourceful and spoilt."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, pain, and loss to relatives and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan DIego Mendoza and Damian Pagnucco," the statement read.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since her side pursued the Southern District of New York for the latter's death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing a two-drug accomplice but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were killed on June 19, 1953 in the electric chair.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, has shown a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack, court filing close.
He told investigators that he was feeling good because of what he was doing, police said.
Saipov told the agencies that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching an ISIS video on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He was not convicted of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal duty defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
"We think that the decision to envisage the death penalty, instead of a declaration of debt and a life in prison with no possibility of being released, will prolong the trauma of these events for everyone," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked not to face the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should suffer Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed during a protest at a Tory conference that he would “mobilize the people’s army.”
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "spoil the heat" of the Eurosceptics - while one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK would already be "out" if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May's challenge to bring back the deeply divided ranks has been met by pro-Remain Tories, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has problems keeping his Chequers compromise plan around attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU on track.
Allies insisted that had should continue to fight to get a deal with Brussels, despite the setbacks – and should force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose either its package or ‘chaos’.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he was going out the Chequers because.
He suggested that Lord Farage should have become a peer and be given responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If he was going to lead, we'd be out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I'm standing up for Brexit but we have to get the Chequers out."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subdued.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone has suggested that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to stay is completely wrong.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march, telling journalists: I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who really go through the streets and lead to us being elected at all.
"When I'm done, I'm going to let Chequers fall and start listening."
In a closed message to Mrs May, it added: "The prime ministers will keep their job if they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians must ‘feel the heat’ if they are going to back the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“It’s a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
"They are trying to leave Brexit behind and we are here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with it.'"
In a message to an enthusiastic public, he added: "I'm because the political class that is short-sighted to go after Brexit is feeling the heat.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country who have given us the victory with Brexit and will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
During this time, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the centre of the city.
A small group of activists knew about Tories Against Brexit banners after the group's founding this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis has been at odds with the Conservatives over the security issues they had with a party app when the conference began.
"These are the people who tell us that they know how to install IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for a smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
"There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
It's time to get ready for the upcoming presidential election.
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, it was "seriously looking forward to becoming a presidential candidate."
The Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts Democrat Samsden spoke about her future during a speech in the town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It's been a hot topic of speculation that the 2020 election will be against Trump.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the electorate in the Stadhal format since Trump took his post.
One of the participants had asked to plan to become a presidential candidate.
Warren replied that it was time "for the women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that also means that a woman must be at the top."
There's been a lot of noise coming from the LSU sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced a Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in relation to the deadly shooting against the basketball player Wayde Sims a Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting, and asked for help to identify the man who is in the video.
The Sims, 20, was shot and killed early on Friday morning after leaving Southern University's campus.
"The Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot to the head and died as a result," Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told the media.
Wayde volunteered to help his colleague and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the spot, with a gun, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a warrant and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The Sims, a 6.6ft junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton knows the world championship title more after team-mates give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel.
It's clear that Mercedes' team line-up will play a major role in the race as Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost took Hamilton apart while he defended his position in the first two tier and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel was the first to go to the pits and led Hamilton to drive to the end of the pack, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes went into the pits one tour after that and was behind the Vettel when it came out, but Hamilton went first after a wheel-to-wheel action because Ferrari drivers had to unintentionally release the interior and risk still waiting to defend the third corner after a double manoeuvre.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He was then up for a majority of the race the first while keeping his tyres to a quick close and to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to become fourth.
He eventually went into the pits at the 44th round but he was unable to raise his pace to the last eight tier yet, while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me pass.
The team did such an exceptional job of having a one-two, Hamilton said.
That was a bad language.
President Donald Trump made a mockery at a rally with Senator Dianne Feinstein because he insisted that Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of a sexual assault, had not leaked.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly discuss Ford's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "evil and greedy and dishonest."
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that was going on during the last few days in the Senate, when one sees the rage, when one sees people who are rose and evil and vain and dishonest," he said.
"When someone looks at what's being made public and is being leaked and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
Do you remember you?
Dianne Feinstein, are you ready?
Remember his answer...did you get the document leaked - 2oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't squirm.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
"No, we didn't, we didn't," he added, as he voiced the senator's opinion.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Ford's Kavanaugh in July, and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein has denied knowing about the leak from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as he asked."
But his denial did not go well with the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday: "I tell you, that was very bad body language.
Maybe it wasn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president, who continues to pursue his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been charged by three women for sexual misconduct, suggests Democrats would use the claims for their own purposes.
"They want to regain the power with all the means necessary.
They see the wickedness, the honesty, it doesn't matter who they are, how they have to race to get power and control," Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have forfeited their ground for the loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee a Saturday.
The Giants were ahead early with two goals through strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the home team's balance before the Giants faced Dwyer again.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard scored for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals secured the victory.
It was a third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was a fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, and the Giants had won the three games previously.
Dwyer's opening was in the fourth minute at 3:35 by a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford giving the assist while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a charged start-up period, Sullivan returned home at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie's his equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants would be given a lead in the first break as he scored the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard brought them back to an equal level with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match late in the second half and he made sure they won with his team their fifth in the half of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next match-up.
The flight attendants are dying to make sure that hundreds of people on the plane can escape from an earthquake.
A flight attendant in Indonesia is recognized as a hero after he died while a wanted to make sure that an aircraft with hundreds of people can get there safely from the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many more are still missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi island, triggering a tsunami.
The area is still heavily populated and many are trapped in the storms of the city of Palu.
But while his coworkers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly shaky control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport.
He remained to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was currently on the runway, could fly safely.
He then jumped out of the traffic control tower as he thought he was going to collapse.
He then died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
Seamen prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before reaching the helicopter Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear that," he said.
While the agencies fear that the number of the dead could go up to thousands, while the country's disaster relief agency says that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is expected that the number will continue to rise, as many bodies are still under the radar while others cannot be reached," said the agency's spokesman, Sutop Purvo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters high destroyed Palu, where a sun was kept a mass burial.
The military and traffickers bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "Every minute brings an ambulance bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is making rapid progress to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find.
It's a tragedy, but it could be much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I urge you all to work day and night to complete your tasks within the scope of the evacuation.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crashes: Air Niugini now says that a man has disappeared after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that carried out a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one man disappeared after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that was about to sink.
Air Niugini said in a public statement that since Saturday afternoon, they could not stand up for a male passenger.
The airline said it is working with local agency, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane got on the water as an attempt was made to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The agency said it was pleased that seven people were brought to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers will still remain in hospital, and that all are in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact outcome of the accident remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane landed in the lagoon, not far from the runway.
Some of the witnesses said that the plane had gone off the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had been hijacked.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to wade through the water that went up to the waist until the safety exits on the plane that was going down with it.
He said he was panicked and shouted that he had suffered a minor blow to the head.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who worked close to improving a shipyard also helped in the rescue by using inflatable boats to bring people ashore before the plane went down to about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the flight safety network indicated that in the last two decades 111 people have died in accidents of PNG-registered airlines, but none of them were in relation to Air Niugini.
A woman was burned alive during the night, and a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution concluded a Saturday's explanation of her case in a second investigation of a man who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. analyst Paul Rowlett of the Department of Justice has singled out Stone as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis
He retired for the jury when a cell phone data was used to co-opt the motion of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from many cell phone operators who showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of his death, contradicting his statements by the very beginning, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers's at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sandford.
Sandford threw out a samsung, claiming he hadn't been to the roof in the city.
When investigators asked if Tellis was going to tell the truth when he said he had been at Sandford's truck that night, Sandford said he was going to "lease because my truck was in Nashville."
Another affidavit was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
They've shown that they've only known each other for a few weeks.
Rowlett said that after a period of time after Chambers' death, Tellis had texted, deleted calls and contact information from Chambers's cell phone.
"He's got his life cut out for him," said Hale.
It is planned that the defense of a sun begins to give its last arguments.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.

After a black one?!
The New York Times has accused a woman of "failure" to get rid of a "smoke"
A New York-based child girl is suing a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misaddressed text message from her mother complaining that it was "still a black man."
The couple denies that they are racist, and compare the complaint to "blackmail"
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed horror when it found out that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when it arrived for its first day in 2016.
"No, no," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But, instead of sending it to his husband, he sent it to Mrs. Maurice, two times.
After noticing the faux pas, a "unwelcoming" Plasco flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, explaining that the girl had just gone, was doing an African-American, bad job and that instead of expecting a Filipino, she had been sent to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her one day's work and was then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple to get compensation from the layoff, expecting a compensation of about $350 per roof for the 6-month job for which it would have lived in the house for which it was initially hired, but without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, something like this doesn't do," a friend told the post, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple lashed out at claims that they were racist, saying that it was the sensible decision to abort Maurice's attitude, fearing that they would not be able to trust him after they insulted him.
"My wife sent him something that he didn't want to say.
There is no racist.
We're not racist people," the man, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
Do you want your children to be able to hold you in the palm of their hands, even if it's not a good idea?
"Your newborn baby?"
Dajee. "
Plasco said, while comparing the complaint to "blackmail," that his wife had only had a baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
Is there a way to run the next one?
That's not a good way to trade," added the investment banker.
While the court case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, tearing them down for their behavior and their logic.
The Paddington publishers were afraid that readers could not relate to a beer that was talking, a new letter added.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it first before it's published.
"It's very exciting to know what we know about Paddington's success."
It said his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a little teddy bear to write the children's book, would have been rose if his work had not been accepted, adding that the 60th birthday of the books would be "battery" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, who describes it as "a very important family member," it says that his father was quietly proud of his later success.
"He was a very quiet man, and he wasn't a person who broke down," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was a bit like having a kid achieve something: it's really proud of them even if it's not one of their own making.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit in that direction.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After the landing, his daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save his life without success.
"Nad has often called to say that it would look very bad, that it would not be expected that it would pack," Ms Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I was called by Nad to say that it was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so, my love.
Well, I'm in there.
I'll be with the mind.
The drugs that doctors gave him to hold his heart at the strokes slowly took effect and left his system.
It was a long time ago, and that was just the end of it.
I just sit there and wait, knowing that all these things are happening.
I couldn't bear to cry or scream or cry because I was in a situation with family and people.
I’m going to have to rap.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, the moment of mourning for the loss of her daughter, had to climb into the plane with the other passengers – without knowing what they had to pass through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I had my head down, and the tears were constantly falling.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a great deal of sympathy for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved me.
Women in mourning send cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide work to keep others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get support, both of which sent a Welsh bridge.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and took his own life at the age of 18.
"I don't want my parents to know what I'm going through," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious grin.
"Everyone knew him because of his grin.
They're always trying to get their hands dirty no matter where they are."
But, he left his job before he died because he was "in a dark place."
In 2014, it was Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, who found his sibling after he took his own life.
Ms Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that this will have consequences."
Mrs Davis made the cards, "informing people that there are people out there who can go and talk to them, even if it's a friend.
Just sit on the line – you have to speak.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after her mother's death.
He didn't say that he was feeling bad or depressed or something," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we realized that something was going on.
It was the end of Christmas – when the children opened their presents, they didn’t look them in the eye or anything like that.”
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to agree: "It raps a laugh through the whole family.
It's going to blow us away.
We all have to fight and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in an unstable balance while the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought if we could really get something like what it asked for - a time-limited inquiry, with limited scope - we might be able to achieve a little unity," said Mr. Flake, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "fall apart" in an entrenched partisanship.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The rest of their work is completely up to date.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush took the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's going on with the FBI's report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to come up with a solution and sue in the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s ‘failures’ under Kim
The number of survivors from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker says.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the South’s Ministry of Unification, saying that it had 1,127 survivors last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China would play a major role in the cost of human smuggling.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
In the end, the North Koreans are forced to surrender to a South Korean government.
Seoul says that, since the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the survivors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
The relations between North and South Korea – which technically still wage war against each other – have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks about the halted denuclearization negotiations.
This is after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally agreed that they should work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, has imposed sanctions on the U.S. for the lack of progress since the debt was incurred.
"Without confidence in the U.S.A., there will be no confidence in our national security and under these conditions it will be impossible for us to disarm unilaterally for the first time," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not suitable for serving on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was "unsuited" in his temperament to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the comments to Samschden in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever acted like that, she would say 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh has claimed he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as they were both emotionally harassed by both teenagers.
During his introductory statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, partly yelling or swallowing while complaining about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated smear campaign" organized by liberals who rose to believe that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's statements proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed he was opposed to Democrats.
"I think he was disqualifying himself with these statements in his way of pushing against the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi expressed concern when asked whether it would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was sworn in, and whether Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm just saying this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only not suitable for being in the Supreme Court, but also for being in court where it's just right," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was worried about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he is considered conservative justice.
Kavanaugh has been asked about the possibility that he might be barring certain Supreme Court decisions from going forward.
"It's not the time to take a hysterical, biased person to court and then expect us to say 'that's not wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And the women have to practice it.
It is a righteous judgment, months and years of anger that overflows, and has not gotten it out without crying.
"We're going to cry when we're going to cry," said Mrs. Steine 45 years later.
"I don't think so, do you?"
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a guiding force somewhere, where she said that she would also cry when she becomes a rose, but that she developed a technique, which means that when she becomes a rose and starts crying, she then says to the person with the expensive she speaks, "You might think I'm crying.
I'm with Rose."
And then it just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are partially allowed as a valve for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my harshest memories of a previous job, in a mostly male office, where I cried with indescribable anger, was that an elderly woman had taken me to the col—a cold manager I was always a little afraid of—and had me trapped in a trap.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know that the rose is.
"They're going to be sad and they're going to be happy that they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and walked out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, with great frustration, thought it should not continue to reflect on the idea of becoming a presidential candidate herself.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision," we said with a smile 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
It's called "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since it was late in the campaign, it was behind the donation-gathering, so it swore that it wouldn't go into the race unless it collected $2 million.
It was a battle that was lost.
She found out that some of his supporters, who gave men $1000, gave him just $250.
"Do you think I'm going to get a refund?" he asked.
When it held its speech and announced that it was not going to launch a formal campaign, it was so overwhelmed with feelings – gratitude for the people who had been supporting it, frustration with the system that makes it so hard to raise money and for voters and non-delegates, and anger against sexism – that it took away his voice.
"I feel like I've got a bit of a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalls about her reaction to the news.
"I'd like to say that I was a corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my grave?
Did you cry?"
The U.S.-China trade war is good for China.
The first salvos of the trade war between the U.S. and China have taken off, and even if the fight is not over yet, a break between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, shot down the first warnings beginning this year by taxing important Chinese exports, such as solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week was with new tariffs hitting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of objects, so in the end, half of the goods coming to the US from China were taxed.
Beijing has struck back each time, placing recent tariffs at five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed that it will join the shot-for-shot of the United States, and the world's second-largest economy will not budge as quickly.
If they were to get Washington to stop it, they would have to go on demand, but to make themselves publically small in front of the United States would be too great a shame for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
But experts say that if Beijing makes the right decisions, the US pressure in the trade war could support China in the long term, as it would make the interdependence of the two economies smaller.
"The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could trigger an economic vortex in the two countries is in the end much more dangerous than the viewers have so far recognized," said Abigail Grace, a scientific associate for the Think Tank Center of New American that focuses on Asia.
Syria is ‘ready’ for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for those refugees who want to return and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by a more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place to ensure that the refugees who want to return to the country and who have to flee due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their everyday lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
More than 6 million people live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to help rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they did not accept the help and support of those who sponsored the uprising.
Europe to win the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup as they defeated Team USA by a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive matches on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown as the Danish captain's team had the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who had the bulk of the tournament's problems, shot his tee-shot into the water at par-3 from the 16th hole, thus losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been excellent in all his rounds, becoming one of the 4 players who have each had a 5-0-0 since the tournament took shape in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was ranked 5&4 the worst player in the ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best placed player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 in 1 against England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, has gone on to become the European with the most wins of all time from the tournament with 25.5 as a career point.
"I don't usually cry my skin can't change.
It was a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he took me with him and believed in me.
I'm so happy to be able to get back into the fold.
It goes to the team., and I'm happy that I could help," said emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He gives the torch to his country's college, John Ram, who defeated U.S. Legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles game a Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel about defeating Tiger Woods, I watched him grow up," Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles as second after Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA had problems finding fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the entire tournament over golf at a high level.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of the boys, they fought.
In the early hours of the morning, we saw the light of day in Europe.
We've fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll get back together, I'll talk to PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll continue.
I love the 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
It has to take out one of its shells.
We were overwhelmed."
