Biker reacts at lightning speed and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Car driver overlooks biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left at about 9.30 pm with her VW coming from Merklingen on the state road 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim.
In doing so, she overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from the direction of Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away in the event of a collision
The biker was still trying to avoid the car, but still brushed it at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the stripping process, the hand and foot brake levers on the Suzuki were torn off and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Presently, he steered his motorcycle in the green stiffs next to the road and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker nevertheless suffered an injury at the bei and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavarian town of Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the company.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positive for the coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 in the series investigation, as the district office Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"To avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," said district administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the occasion of the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but cucumbers are only for pickles.
Mamming is a rural community with about 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
In the yard, infected and uninfected employees were separated, the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
The Greens and the SPD gave the state government joint responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting control of the accommodations of seasonal workers.
“This can take a bitter revenge if such local infection events have to take place and regional lockdowns have to be arranged,” said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
“After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already demanded a special control program for farms with harvest helpers,” said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"It is precisely the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions that must be strictly controlled from our point of view.
That obviously didn't happen."
The outburst came “with an announcement.”
Aidenbachstra<0xC3><0x9F>e underground station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the track bed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstra<0xC3><0x9F>e underground station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday there was a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstra<0xC3><0x9F>e underground station at around 4:15 p.m.
A passerby alerted the police, who approached with several stripes.
According to the first investigations, a Municher (17) pushed a 19-year-old man to the ground.
In the process, the young man slipped over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the fallen man to climb off the track.
There was no danger of an incoming train.
As the police announced, there were again disputes between the two people.
The 17-year-old initially fled the crime scene, but his personal details could be determined in retrospect.
Accompanied by his father, he went to police inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer urges longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for an extension of data retention - instead of the ten weeks planned for half a year.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a quick change of law.
Seehofer wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to “make urgently necessary adjustments in the law already now,” the paper quoted from the letter.
Currently, data retention is suspended.
A decision of the ECJ is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes in advance so that they could be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Justice Department told the newspaper that it would only be possible to meaningfully examine whether legal adjustments would be necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already spoken out in June for data retention.
NBA Strip Club Trouble for Clippers Star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams, 33, basketball professional of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, however, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who reportedly admitted the visit, is back in Isolation, being tested for Covid-19 daily.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these wings.
Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta) have the best wings in town.
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA Williams has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
Thus, the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to finish the corona season.
Currently, the top 22 teams are preparing for the season finale, which begins on Friday night, with training matches.
Söder comments on corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a testoffensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has alarmed authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and over a third have become infected with the coronavirus.
The farm is now under quarantine and is closed off with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free corona tests to the approximately 3,300 residents of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the district office assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Bites of Conscience": Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown to be cooperative," attorney Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defense lawyer added, "He very much regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was “plagued with conscience and taken away by the extent of the destruction.”
In the event of a conviction, the man faces ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been badly damaged in a fire on Saturday night last week.
The fire broke out at three distant places in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect was arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came into the attention of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended to consider the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
“German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates fait accompli,” Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to become dangerous Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, there is no getting around the debate about whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors for clubs that want to break into this phalanx".
However, he has doubts about whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
“It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European single market,” Grindel said.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to create more competitive balance in the Bundesliga only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at the European level, but do not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even a uniform distribution of TV funds will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million euros and RB Leipzig of 300 million euros.
So the differences between the first three clubs alone are immense.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
Looking back at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
“Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and have poked through it to the press rather than addressing it to me,” Grindel said of the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
“It has been very busy for me humanly.”
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
“I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences,” Grindel said.
"I dealt with the ominous watch gift completely transparently and innocently.
Many in the DFB knew about it.”
He had never “made a secret out of the gift,” the 58-year-old assured.
"This may be called naive, but this kind of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
Black Lives Matter: Injured and One Dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have come to a head again with Donald Trump’s use of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday, clashes broke out in various cities between protesters and police.
In Louisville, three people were injured, and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was killed by gunshots while a demonstration train was just crossing an intersection.
There had previously been clashes in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and forcibly dispersed protesters.
Hundreds, some armed, marched through Louisville, Kentucky on Saturday demanding that those responsible for Breonna Taylor’s death be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was killed in a drug raid in her Louisville apartment in March.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there at all, and no drugs were found.
When a member of a group calling himself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators of a white militia had also formed.
The meeting between the two groups ultimately did not take place.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and died in the course of a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
Police said they took a suspect into custody.
So far, she has not provided any more details on the circumstances of the incident.
Mayor Steve Adler told The New York Times that he, like many in the city, was “dismayed and stunned” by what had happened.
Protesters also clashed with police in the American metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to construction vehicles in front of a youth prison, the police used flash grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police or assault.
In Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters smashed windows, shot down fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
Police said one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to the hospital injured.
In addition, windows were smashed in a court there and a fire was set, the police said.
Investigations have been launched.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big sauce was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, actors and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale is burning, Rakoczy-Ball or Festzug, many came to their costs with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when only the historical were in the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konh<0xC3><0xA4>user and her husband have always visited the Rakoczy festival in Bad Kissingen for more than 25 years.
This time in the Corona year.
The couple has made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold casino, observes the historical while strolling and listens to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I find it very pleasant," says Konh<0xC3><0xA4>user.
She misses the masses of people who otherwise do not belong to Rakoczy.
But it lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale on Friday evening as well as the historic pageant and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's too bad.
The weather would have been great this year,” she says.
Rakoczy riding tournament to be held again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant more work.
For example, Christina Gold, who participates in the parade in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was in costume on foot in the city on Saturdays and Sundays.
"It's harder, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The riding club had less to do, even if individual riders were on the way in the park.
"We very much hope that the riding quadrille will be allowed to take place again next year," says chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of pause in 2021, a Rakoczy riding tournament will take place again.
28 Corona cases at Spanish second division Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football league CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper into the crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid flew to the city of A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a on July 20, despite the first Corona cases, one low blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had tested positive, one was hospitalized, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid had the chance to reach the promotion playoffs.
Now even the relegation to the B-group of the Second League threatens.
The game against Deportivo La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the prosecutor’s office is investigating a possible crime against public health, the top sports authority CSD is considering the forced relegation of the club.
The players and other team members sit in a hotel in quarantine.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel or gel," the sports newspaper "AS" wrote.
Photos show players hanging underwear and club clothes in their hotel rooms to dry after apparently having to wash them themselves.
The bed linen was not changed for five days.
Another problem is food.
It is neither good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
However, the club management said they were satisfied with the hotel.
Javier Tebas Llanas, the club’s lawyer, dismissed the allegation that he had deliberately endangered public health.
The Spanish Primera Division president Javier Tebas’s son, Javier Tebas, told the Europa Press news agency and the sports newspaper “Marca” that he had not violated the rules set by the football association.
Before the flight, there were four infected people until July 19, but they were all isolated and did not travel.
Just before the flight to A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a on Monday, all players and team members had been tested again.
When the team was already in A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, the Corona test was positive for "five or six" other team members.
The game was canceled 60 minutes before the start, Tebas Llanas said.
Police have to catch horses pulled out of steam shed

After the trust of the horses could be won by the officials shortly before Dampfach, they each had a rope carried in the patrol car put down.
Cycling professional Tony Martin: career continuation imaginable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is considering a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time time trial world champion Tony Martin can certainly imagine to continue his cycling career.
“I’m currently working with the team on the framework conditions for how and in what form it could continue,” the 35-year-old told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper.
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the corona break.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
He used to get up after a fall, and the first thought was: “Quick back on the bike.
Today, as a father of a little daughter, I think, “What if?”
The cycling professional admitted that there are aspects with which he is increasingly difficult to deal with.
"But it did me good to remember from the Corona time, what I have in cycling and how much fun it is for me".
The time trial specialist will return to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5th to 9th August).

Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac there will be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco soon.
The eight-time French champion will perform on 1 August (6 p.m.) at the Hessen, the former club of the Croat.
For the Bundesliga, it is the first and only endurance test before the second leg in the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).

It’s always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends,” Kovac said.
“It’s an interesting test,” said the 48-year-old.
Before joining FC Bayern Munich, Kovac coached Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB-Pokal.
“A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I am looking forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croatian at the Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurters lost the first leg of the round of 16 against Basel in their own stadium with 0:3.

Argentina rejects counter-offer from creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires said on Saturday.
“This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair,” the statement said.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term gains of our creditors".
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
That is why Argentina is asking its private creditors to waive part of their claims of around $66 billion (about 59 billion euros).
If there is no agreement, the country is again threatened with a state bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth payment default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had called for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contract clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect economic power to decline by around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not settled interest claims of 503 million US dollars and had slipped into a limited default.
Professionally arrived - not yet private
"It's going super well" - Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws this conclusion after her first days in the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller at the notary’s office in Eggenfelden.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law took up work, the normal day-to-day business is already running at full speed.
"But I still have to arrive privately," she explains in an interview with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to relocate the center of life from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native dingolfingerin.
Currently, she and her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg, are looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city.
At least her husband was still able to apply for parental leave at short notice to ensure the care of the two daughters (31<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 11<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has a place to stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has long been a household name for her.
During visits on site with her family in the past few months, she once again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection process for the vacant position.
Her home country of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal traineeship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notarised sorority, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Lower Allg<0xC3><0xA4>u as well as Regensburg - during this time she also "besides" the doctorate in labour law - she took her first position in 2012 as a notary in Rottalmünster in the district of Passau.
In 2016 she went on parental leave, it finally followed the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has provided representation services in various notarial offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she had seen the right time for the full professional re-entry, explains the 39-Year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has immediately prepared a praise for the team of the law firm: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-established processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private center of life.
In terms of kindergarten and cr<0xC3><0xA8>che places, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which is mandatory to comply with, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the Revierstadt holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga games.
In the ghost games of the past season caused by the corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues break away completely."
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side length."
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited,” Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing chief praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work."
Tiny miracle: early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packerl of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of about 400 premature babies that are cared for annually at the Graz Children’s Clinic.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and specially made mini diapers for them.
But not so small that they would not be in voice - "and how," smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if they don't scream as loud as big babies, of course."
When the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd shortly before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the students with the production "Das Heimatkleid" - via video.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange information about the play and the performance via Skype with the actress and the director Winfried Tobias.
The idea for the performance format had been born from the current corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was happy about the enrichment of the lessons.
Even if at the end all participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theater and stage space would offer additional stimuli, you can also see the potential for contact in the schools in the theater.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB-Pokal, the Lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB-Pokal have been determined.
The Lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt on a successful qualification.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because the field of participants is not yet complete due to the corona pandemic, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary renunciation of semi-final opponents FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4th or 5th September).
There, the Lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should second-tier champions Würzburg reach the final, Sechzig would already be qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against regional league player Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB-Pokal will take place between the 11th and 14th of September and thus one week before the start of the third league.
"Gone with the Wind": Olivia de Havilland is dead
Olivia de Havilland, the Oscar-winning actress, has died.
She died on Sunday in Paris at the age of 104 of a natural death, confirmed her spokeswoman for the German press agency.
De Havilland was best known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in "Gone with the Wind" (1939).
Born to British parents in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
The Austrian theatre man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia of Shakespeare's "Summer Night's Dream".
Warner Brothers signed her for seven years and released her alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the leading role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Motherheart".
Three years later, the award for best actress came in William Wyler's "The Heiress".
She was also widely recognized as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Pit".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her in 1952 for the lead role in the film adaptation of her novel "My Cousin Rachel".
The play became a worldwide success.
With her long-time friend Bette Davis, she played in "Lullaby for a corpse".
From the marriage with the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) emerged the son Benjamin.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had his daughter Gis<0xC3><0xA8>le with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beachvolleyball: Thole/Wickler miss final on comeback
World Cup runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they lost in the semi-finals to their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Most recently, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.
In the final on the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers/Flüggen lost against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played at Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: The tickets secured Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The expulsion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the point of view of the FDP only a "fig sheet" and does not change anything about the character of the party.
“The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far-right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD," FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiations confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided in May by a majority.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
“If the AfD were really concerned about consistently removing right-wing extremists from its party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his supporters would have long been excluded,” Strasser said.
"There is no political will in the AfD, however, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU general secretary Markus Blume said: “The fact that Andreas Kalbitz now remains excluded says nothing and does not change anything,” he told Welt am Sonntag.
"It rather speaks volumes about how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has".
Blume expects that the AfD will again land below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD country and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the stoning as "secured right-wing extremist striving".
In May, the AfD-Bundesvorstand Kalbitz had thrown out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz did not indicate a former membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreuen Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and with the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing faction in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change anything about the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz".
This decision will not weaken the federal party or the right wing.
"The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
You want to avoid further observation by the secret service and try to get through under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not let go of the ghosts it called.
An expulsion does not change anything," commented the Brandenburg SPD general secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here's where the AfD Country Association and the faction held on to their right-wing leader to this day".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz’s membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea have fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet’s grid area, have supplied an additional 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
In total, wind power from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea is 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany; this is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities in addition to wind conditions, as new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea all run at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
“In Germany and the Netherlands, we will be investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then,” said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity even at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration for 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke through the usual framework after the corona break.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery was the association "Sandtogether".
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windbergfest does not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy and - aware of how difficult it is for the participants economically - hoped until the last minute," said Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-partisan).
"But ultimately, as organizers, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people".
Because if tens of thousands had streamed onto the festival grounds and into the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much would have been left of a folk festival.
Moreover, the organisational and monitoring burden would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg consoled for next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth in Achleiten not to beat
The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four wins at four starts on the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also unbeaten on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the freestyle.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly prevailed in the special on Sunday against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
Also in the freestyle, the German was on Saturday on Quantaz clear in front of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first freestyle ever.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all the important four tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The University of Worms continues to expand: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is donating a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start your studies not only in the summer semester but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities of both the university and the air traffic control academy of the DFS are used evenly.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students are in the Air Traffic Management degree program as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
This year, nine students have already started.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of studies and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of DFS when signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, comprehensive knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue our good cooperation with the university and at the same time underline our attractiveness as an employer."
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences, also underlines this: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree programme in Air Traffic Management."
Deutsche Flugsicherung’s trust is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research competence in the future fields of aviation.
With its first endowed professorship for a dual course of study, the university can set very special highlights and innovative focal points for its students in the deployment of the air traffic controllers of tomorrow.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasizes: "With its focus on air transport, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the university's profile".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway was completely closed on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, because the rescue helicopter was in use after a traffic accident.
A 76-Year-old drove with a Ford around 12.40 clock in the exit Alzenau-Mitte in the curve straight ahead and landed at the guardrail.
As a result of the impact, the front airbags were released, the driver suffered minor injuries to the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were treated by the emergency doctor and the patient was subsequently flown to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger of life.
The damaged vehicle, on which a damage of about 2000 euros was incurred, had to be towed.
Heil wants to test other industries after meat industry
The corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Legislation tightening is imminent.
Are they right, and will they be right?
According to the now planned strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry, Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) also wants to check other industries.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ foreign personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of contract workers and temporary workers should be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and employee leasing, if you do not want to completely strangle the economy".
Contracts for work are, for example, mandatory for a wide range of trades, the construction industry and plant construction as the basis for their value creation at the customer.
"The misdeeds of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts make sense.
"When an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a very normal contract of work".
The German meat industry considers a ban on contracts for work and temporary work to be unconstitutional in its sector alone.
It is not possible to explain why different labour law should apply to portioning and packaging cheese in future than to sausage, according to a statement on the draft law, as the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday) reports.
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would therefore rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
According to the results of an audit by the NRW Occupational Safety and Health Administration, workers in many Eastern Europe from works contract companies worked 16 hours a day in the industry.
Often they did not have a break.
Wage was retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation with the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law had already entered into force in 2017 for the meat industry.
However, "trickful constructions" had bypassed them.
"Now we have to clean up fundamentally."
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which we want to decide in the cabinet at the end of July, are also measures that not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher inspection rates in occupational safety or clear criteria for community accommodation."
The draft presented to the dpa includes amendments to the Act on the Safeguarding of Workers’ Rights in the Meat Industry and to the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
Brandenburg’s Minister of Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.
"I would like us to be able to carry out even more checks in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example, animal transport," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more staffing is also needed for more controls.
Three dead in ultralight plane crash in Germany
According to the police, three people have died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people were rescued in the accident, said a spokesman for the district control center Wesel.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, police said.
The Rheinische Post reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not initially known.
Evacuation of Frankfurt Opera Square proceeds peacefully
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of the Opernplatz took place peacefully during the night on Sunday.
Finally, several dozen people stayed in the square, but left it before the curfew at 1 a.m.
The police had been on duty with numerous officers since the early evening, and a larger police force was to be seen throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, a ban on entering the Opernplatz, where riots had occurred a week ago, was in force.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of revelers.
At least five officers were injured after police entries, several police vehicles damaged.
Saturday night was quiet as well.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday at around 1:25 p.m.
She was taken to the Klinikum Kassel.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade was looking for possible passengers.
According to the police, the woman was on Bundesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 83 in the direction of her place of residence Hümme, when her car came off the road for a previously unexplained cause and hit her several times.
In order to save the victim, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the turntable ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered to search for people.
However, the emergency services did not find anyone among the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured person was taken to the Kasseler Klinikum with the ambulance for further care.
Nearly 50 firefighters from the fire brigades Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The highway was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus champions in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in the club's history perfect with a 2-0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before half time.
With 83 points, Turin, which without the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira started, two game days before the end of the season of the Serie A is no longer from first place.
Inter Milan are seven points behind.
Juventus were innocuous despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo hit after a free kick variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old retired from the penalty area with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot dusted Federico Bernardeschi (67.).
This ensured the lackluster, but decisive success.
The penalty kick in the 89th minute is probably only Ronaldo himself with a view to the goal-hunting score really pissed.
"It's complicated to stay at ball height mentally and physically for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum is changing very easily," said coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
In the end, Juve’s reassuring lead at the top of the table was mainly due to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will still be the top scorer is questionable.
Because while the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has already 34 goals in his account after his three-pack in the 5:1 (1:1) of the table fourth Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve pro Gonzalo Higua<0xC3><0xAD>n.
The Argentinian scored 36 goals for the SSC Napoli in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "old lady" of Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus are in the round of 16 of the Champions League, but will have to make up for a 0-1 draw against Olympique Lyon on 7 August to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Despite all threatened penalties and court rulings, motorists continue to give gas to countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable figures for the years before, but the speeders are making the judicial authorities increasingly work: In the public prosecutor’s offices between Konstanz and Mannheim, a total of 155 investigations for illegal races were conducted in 2018, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the answer of the Ministry of the Interior to a request of the SPD state parliament.
In most cases, the drivers had spontaneously competed against each other or they had taken the flight from the police - this is also indicated as an illegal race.
The drivers were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences handed down.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and trials of past years and indicated more often, a ministry spokesman said.
Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with speedsters. Again and again, motorists slow down traffic there in order to gain space and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "racing track"
On the A81, the police even register more races than on any other federal highway.
A speed limit is used to try to brake the racers on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and upgraded sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers avoid to the lawn to Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would eliminate this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for racers would be significantly higher if you were not legally allowed to be on the road here and there with 200 kilometers per hour and more".
Rivoir is less concerned with education or image campaigns: "Anyone who defies all rules in such a way and puts not only his own life, but also the lives of other road users at risk, is hardly reachable with reason".
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that racers will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of the Department of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and tougher controls on the affected routes.
It is not uncommon for the high-speed show of strength to become painful and momentous seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people died in the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a nocturnal crash in Stuttgart’s city centre and one in Gerlingen.
There, two young men are said to have delivered a car race in November.
One of the vehicles got off the road, hit a garden wall and remained lying on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, harsher penalties are not necessary, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: "Legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races harder is not seen," the paper said.
Blue light of July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road around 3.40 a.m. and ran towards the snack bar.
There he noticed a man using the fridge with drinks and then leaving the snack bar through a previously knocked-in front door.
The perpetrator fled in the direction of the meadows behind the snack bar.
According to the police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he was wearing a black hoodie, black pants, and bright shoes.
The police receive further witness information.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Cycling professional Pascal Ackermann won his second victory of the day on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatinate rider from Team Bora-hansgrohe won the mass sprint on the 109-kilometre section with start and finish in Sibiu, having already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season wins three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall standings, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had sovereignly decided the mountain time trial in the morning and thus took the top in the classification.
There were only 104 drivers in the final stage that evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the new season with a win," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
“The sprint was really hectic,” said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the finish, he had simply put on his sprint, "and it worked out perfectly."
In accordance with the rules of the World Federation UCI, a corona test was carried out six days before the start of the race for all race participants and their companions.
During the entire tour, drivers and carers were separated from the organisation team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Viewers at the start and finish were not allowed.
Control center gave instructions for lay reanimation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment building, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call was received just before 1 p.m.
"A control center dispatcher immediately gave instructions for lay reanimation," a fire department spokesman told BILD.
The incoming rescuers took over the resuscitation measures shortly afterwards.
The child, who was in mortal danger, was transported to the university hospital under resuscitation.
Why it crashed is unclear.
The police have routinely started the investigation into the accident.
The fire department spokesman: "We are assuming a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nürnberg: Unapproved tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily more than 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to control such events more.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to Mittelfranken police, around 10.30 p.m., the Nuremberg traffic police found an increased vehicle volume in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolst<0xC3><0xA4>dter Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
As a result, the police carried out a large number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to step up action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers counted at the top a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police balance.
Of these, however, only a small part of those present could be attributed to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the appeal of the police.
Based on the vehicles and people on site, it was to be assumed that these were predominantly onlookers.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed at around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials noticed such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car racing
There were no illegal car races.
"The Central Franconia Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and continue to implement intensified control measures, also in connection with the emergence of onlookers," it said.
The agency News5 spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger of the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," said Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Also, because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to cause damage.
"The young people should finally get their cars back unscathed."
Employment agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse in the case of short-time work
The Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time work allowance.
“This is extremely low among more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work,” said Daniel Terzenbach, the executive board responsible for operational business, the “Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung”.
When at the beginning of the corona crisis suddenly many companies had applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually, the exam lasts up to three weeks.
“So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
We will take a closer look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there'll be more to come.
We are not na<0xC3><0xAF>ve and have a long breath.”
Evidence of abuse would often come from affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
“Will there be more insolvencies than last year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves for the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money."
The numbers are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the district drivers of the Stiftung Preu<0xC3><0x9F>ische Schlösser und G<0xC3><0xA4>rten (SPSG), the foundation announced at the request of PNN.
The kids then left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people would have played rugby in the Neues Garten.
The meadow had been cleared by district drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
There are always illegal celebrations in the parks.
In the parks of the foundation, accumulations occur again and again, in which the distance and hygiene rules Covid-19 handling regulations are not observed.
At the end of June, there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Park Babelsberg, and a week later, about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a corona ordinance, the parks will be closed at nightfall.
The storage on the meadows is prohibited according to the parking regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has long complained that visitors would leave more and more waste and destroy protected biotopes.
Meanwhile, illegal park parties in Berlin have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party in the night to Sunday.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, as the state authorities in Linz announced.
There were more than 100 results in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but also at least one holiday guest was tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday night.
The curfew was fixed at 11 p.m.
"There are there and there cancellations and cancellations" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Some of the guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are Germans.
The first infections were announced on Friday.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the interns, who had celebrated in several locals and could have infected themselves there.
“We all liked to do that in our youth,” he told the radio station <0xC3><0x96>1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of corona spreading throughout Europe in the initial phase of the pandemic.
In Austria, more than 1,500 people are currently infected with the virus.
The focal points for new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
LONDON (AP) — Manchester United are returning to the Champions League after a year of absence.
The Red Devils secured third place on the last matchday of the Premier League by a 2-0 (0:0) victory against direct rival Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle with the Europa League, because FC Chelsea still passed and qualified as fourth for the premier class.
In the fight against the relegation, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United went through a penalty from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute) in the lead.
After a red card for Leicester City in extra time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) reached the final score.
Chelsea, FC Bayern's opponent in the Champions League semi-finals, won in parallel against the Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea’s victory over Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who passed the Wolves with a meager 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford and AFC Bournemouth, but had to shiver for a long time at West Ham United.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately balanced Andrei Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1-1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which scored three coaches in the season, is relegated after five first league years.
Just like Bournemouth, which could not save itself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool FC, which has been established as the English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
The record is set by Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club, it was an extraordinary season," van Dijk said after the match, "that should spur us on to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
The Premier League bosses should also be satisfied in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were suspended from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there was even a discussion about premature cancellation or the rest of the games being played on neutral ground.
Finally, the season could be played without special events - however, as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming more and more violent.
During the night there were violent clashes.
Israeli police have taken violent action against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on the night of Sunday.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to disperse the rally.
In total, according to media reports, around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu’s headquarters on Saturday night.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu’s handling of the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of a counter-demonstration who supported Netanyahu were also arrested, reported the news site "ynet".
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the Prime Minister’s private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv, according to police, because it is suspected to have sprayed pepper spray on demonstrators at the roadside from a moving car.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The protester was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The demonstrations accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the coronavirus crisis.
Among other things, he is held up for hasty loosening and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The corona crisis has severely affected the country’s economy.
The unemployment rate was more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel recently rose to new record levels.
Accident near Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter kraft auf Auto - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A rear-end collision on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen claimed nine lightly injured.
A car driver was on her way with her two children (3, 5) in the direction of Beckum.
The police: "Probably she had suddenly braked because she wanted to turn".
The driver of a Mercedes van who drove behind her must have seen this too late.
He hit the back of the car.
In the accident, three occupants in the car and six in the van were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea shuts down border town after coronavirus case
North Korea has so far seen a "luminous success" in its own measures to ward off the coronavirus.
Now, for the first time, the country is reporting a suspected case.
Due to a first official Corona case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, “the malignant virus could have been introduced into the country,” state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership issued the highest level of alarm.
If confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea has so far not recorded a single infection and described its defenses as a "bright success."
The information was doubted abroad.
The disease symptoms were reportedly detected in an “outlier” that illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
He left South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the border crossing within the four kilometer wide and mostly still mined military buffer zone, there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
South Korea’s military, however, admitted the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea was high, according to the national news agency Yonhap.
Investigations have been carried out on some people.
North Korea called an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Workers' Party, chaired by Kim Jong Un, on Saturday because of the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster."
Kim has already ordered on Friday, as a preventive measure, "to completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others," it said.
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been placed under quarantine.
The central military commission of the party should therefore investigate the "outbreak case" as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose harsh punishment.
Kaesong is estimated to be home to about 300,000 people.
Tension ahead of Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still up for discussion before a big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale inner-city development east project," it says rather casually in the middle part of the municipal press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the Congress Center Pforzheim.
Above all, the appreciation of the eastern city is controversially discussed until the end.
The majorities for this are scarce, most recently in individual committees, depending on attendance, even negative.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), the project developed out of the citizenry and then by the administration and municipal council now after almost ten years of preparation to fail, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "unsuspecting", "speculation", "disparagement" and "conscious false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit comes the city cheaper, contrary to statements of the city administration after grants, of which Klein is convinced, to rehabilitate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently from what is predicted in the city hall and on the part of supporters from the economy.
The FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept one day after Klein.
Essentially, it also provides for the refurbishment of the Technical Town Hall, the keeping of the Schlo<0xC3><0x9F>berg open, the rental of the ex-Thale for administrative areas and a smaller-scale inner-city redesign, ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from noise pollution caused by road traffic, including frequent speed reductions.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30, but the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen, because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise by neglecting regular bus traffic with thinned clocks and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, it is on the agenda of accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the re-registration of the parental contributions in the urban day-care facilities and the application for admission to the Smart City funding of the federal government.
Citizens are welcome, but must heed corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann starts his premiere season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the League of Supercars can start regular operations, the first test drives were now due.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first business trip in Grasser Racing’s new Lamborghini Huracan.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps at the Lausitzring and got used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
“There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season,” says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun".
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite only 25 years of experience in GT racing, the Dutchman has been able to help his new team-mate in many ways.
“I’m not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges,” says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have also made tremendous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring".
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
In 2015 he was last guest at the Motodrom.
“It worked quickly and I didn’t have to get used to the track much,” says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen-based racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has a lot of fast passes that you have to meet optimally to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is then, that turns out in two weeks.
“Of course, the teams play a little bit in the tests,” he says.
"Finally, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely packed calendar.
There will be seven races by the beginning of November.
The current state of affairs is that no spectators will be admitted – but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take part in the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister Cold Caught by Quarantine Decision
The British government’s decision to quarantine Spanish tourists for two weeks after their return has caught the country’s transport minister cold, according to press reports.
Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday the measure.
Due to the rising numbers of corona in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine requirements is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are just on the deadline holiday, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is considered to be one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"Numerous ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," said Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one bothered to tell Grant Shapps".
Less than a month after the end of the corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists blame nightlife in particular for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the favourite holiday destinations of the British.
The British government is currently advising against unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, with the exception of the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Day of the Navy: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced on Navy Day in his country that warships will be equipped with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons, unique in the world, the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
The Ministry of Defense also informed the agency Interfax about successful tests of the hypersonic rocket Zirkon, which was built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of around 343 meters per second.
They are the weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo will continue to be built
It will also be built on the nuclear-equipped underwater torpedo Poseidon, it said.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also drove a military boat, said that this year alone, 40 new ships would be put into service at the individual fleet associations of the largest country on earth.
Russia has such a large coastal area like no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
In many other Russian coastal towns, the naval forces also paraded the day of the Navy.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside the leader Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartu.
Ammunition was also fired there.
A video released by the Ministry of Defense showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also attack helicopters and jets.
Hurricane 'Hanna' Reaches Texas: Corona Help Makes It Harder
Washington – The first hurricane of this year’s season over the Atlantic has hit land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threaten parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center told the U.S. climate authority NOAA on Sunday night (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency.
The Texas coronavirus pandemic is making the work of the helpers more difficult, Abbott said, according to the US media.
Evacuees called for caution
“Every hurricane is a huge challenge,” Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle.
Looking at the hurricane in Texas, he added, “This challenge is complicated and will be exacerbated when you consider that it sweeps through an area that is the most affected area of the state by Covid-19.”
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not disregard practices “to which we have become accustomed,” such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It is important that everyone keep their distance.
In some places, hotel rooms were also provided.
In addition, emergency shelters should be tested for corona.
Damage had initially been reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was hit on land on the island of Padre Island just off the Texas coast, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to hurricane of the lowest level one.
A storm surge warning was issued for the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" moved further inland and headed towards the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" is moving to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane Douglas was heading toward Hawaii at night on Sunday with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.
The hurricane center, however, expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it will be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could be very strong hurricanes, the authority said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, the below average one even only ten percent, it was said at the time.
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that his administration is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with affected states.
Four goals conceded: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic have lost two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals missed: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven-black evening in the 0:2 (0:1) at SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really angry at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival not given goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR gone so hard against a team," commented the Corriere dello Sport.
Host Naples had gone through a goal of full-back Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute in the lead, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic initially cheered the equalization.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) withdrew the goal due to an offside position.
Five minutes later Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - again the VAR intervened.
The goals of attackers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) also took the referee team back after the advice of the VAR.
In extra time, Allan made the 2-0 final score for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"For Sassuolo, the VAR is worse than a speed trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no other team before.
The new technology sets records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League started for double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
After a short holiday and a few days of training, Hansi Flick, who recovered "somewhat well" after the first team training, has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a band injury on the left foot and threatens to miss in decisive royal class duels.
In the bad weather in Munich, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A return to Chelsea in the round of 16 on 8 August will be difficult, and the 24-year-old can only hope for the final tournament, which will start on 12 August in Lisbon.
However, Bayern do not want to be stopped by the mishap from the training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick mentioned the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal’s capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to show its winning title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the King class final on August 23.
"We have mastered the mandatory tasks with championship and cup simply excellent.
Now we have to create something special,” Flick said.
Until the Munich team can deal with the final tournament and previously a training camp at the Algarve, but first of all the eighth-final duty is against Chelsea.
After the 3-0 in the first leg before the corona break, the Londoners in the home arena should not be like in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012 again to the Bayern nightmare.
“We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game," demanded Flick.
A test for the tuning is on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, on a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players on S<0xC3><0xA4>bener Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, including the new players around high-end shopping Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all new players, has fitted in well," Flick said.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. are no longer only allowed to train, Flick much preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, the team is now trained in team strength for the Londoners, who are in the playing rhythm in contrast to the Flick ensemble.
After that, Munich could face Barcelona and Lionel Messi in the quarter-finals, while Real Madrid, Manchester City and Juventus Turin could face off in the semi-finals.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not quite so easy", stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup record scorer Klose and Flick know about many common tournament preparation, which is particularly important in the 0-to-100-attunement.
Working with his current team was “a pleasure,” Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with nine teams on Sunday was also ambitious.
Of the top performers, all were present, including the departing Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts beyond the royal class season is not secured.
Formula 1 Needs a Special Rule to Elect Its World Champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise in order to award the World Championship titles.
All American races have been cancelled.
Racing calendars are becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten Grand Prix confirmed so far, three more racetracks were added during the week.
In October, the race will take place at the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portim<0xC3><0xA3>o, Portugal.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will compete for World Championship points on the traditional Italian circuit in Imola.
As a result, the 2020 racing calendar currently includes 13 races.
“We are pleased to continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season,” said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motorsport will be completed in this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 will conclude its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the already officially targeted races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, according to media reports, performances could still take place in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulations require races on three continents
The regulations of Formula 1 require at least races on three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are raced, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles, citing "extraordinary circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the upcoming corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Rejection sparks criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
“We look forward to being with them again next season,” Carey said.
The cancellation of the America race was particularly criticized in Brazil: "The cancellation came as no surprise for us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
For example, the number of infections in the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo region is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concern of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify a refusal.
Be prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad looks at Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert’s famous latenight show via video switch and revealed in an interview what she had in mind during her encounter with Donald Trump.
Climate kivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US latenight show via video switch.
Among other things, she talked about her fight against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous “evil look” at her encounter with Donald Trump.
In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention with her tireless commitment to the “Fridays For Future” movement.
Now she spoke on a well-known latenight show about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powerful of the world.
“There are some things that surprised me,” she said.
“How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis,” she said.
“Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of kids are taking to the streets,” she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who ridicule her on social media or even try to silence her, find her "funny" as she shows the reactions "because they have no other answer to it."
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was approached about a well-known scene in which she cast a bitter look behind US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the actuary sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was caught by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip created a GIF, an animated image that ultimately became one of the most used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think of the US president at the moment?
To the relatively open-ended question of Stephen Colbert she answered only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I think that requires no further explanation".
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick-witted answer and disappeared from the picture laughing for a moment.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now on par with Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe’s Golden Shoe.
Former Dortmund player Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional contributed three goals in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalties in the extra-times of both halves.
The 30-year-old now has 34 goals for the season from the fourth of the table two season before the end - just as many scored Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the leader in the evening still on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid climb with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly back up again.
Blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton recognized Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now long legendary band in 1967 in London, until today his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group to charity.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a great crucifix.
Mental health problems also played a role.
Three years after its formation, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from substance abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived temporarily on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946, the son of a Jewish working-class family in Bethnal Green, London.
At a young age, he became passionate about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to be the lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners on stage.
Later, he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton at the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 along with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross", composed by Green, gave the group its first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green did not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
The life between music and addiction he later commented in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit".
