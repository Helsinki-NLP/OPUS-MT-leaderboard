The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India’s new Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first major foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr. Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the world’s third largest economic nation.
Plans for greater nuclear cooperation are high on the agenda.
India is reportedly also hoping for a defense cooperation treaty between the two nations.
Karratha police arrest 20-year-old after speedy motorcycle chase
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha attempted to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police report that the driver then ignored the stop signs and continued driving on Burgess Road before turning off into the bushland, where officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle, as well as a person corresponding to the description of the driver, were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police accuse a 20-year-old man of failing to heed a stop signal as well as reckless driving.
He is scheduled to appear before the district court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster Accused of Hotel Rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read the indictment at a hearing by the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was “unconscious, asleep, and could not signal consent.”
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the trial date for November 17 at the Edinburgh Supreme Court.
Return to the very American ideal of labor rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of unions as a civil right.
“Just as unions die, so do middle-class jobs,” said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud to present the Employee Empowerment Act together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This ground-breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities to discriminate against unions as it does against other forms of discrimination – and thus stops anti-union forces.
The addition of the National Labour Law Act to provide an opportunity for discriminated workers to organize a union representation, to sue for justice in a civil court – and to receive damages or punitive damages – is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative – at least not by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks faced by unions in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country — Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and uphold labor rights.
There was a time millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to pass a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojo would be replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that the workers and their unions had a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the rights of workers to union and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would have to organize and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause that explicitly stated: “The right to form associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements that restrict or aim to diminish this right are null and void; measures aimed at it are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the other writers inserted a guarantee that “everyone has the right to form or join trade unions for the protection of their interests.”
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a trade union - and that this trade union should then be allowed to participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected.
After these rights have come under attack in America, it is indeed very wise to re-emphasize the American ideal that the working people must have the right to unite and make their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, labor has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have made America great in the past and delivered on the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily halts law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday provisionally halted the implementation of a law in Louisiana, which lawyers say is believed to have led to the closure of all five of the state’s abortion clinics.
This measure, which was billed by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and is due to come into effect Sept. 1, would force doctors performing abortions to acquire a patient admission right at a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors can continue to legally perform abortions while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs may continue to operate in accordance with the law while they seek to obtain these rights," federal judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling.
A hearing for the judge will be held within one month in order to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, saying that doctors would gain more time to gain hospital admission rights.
“Today’s decision means that the women in Louisiana are escaping a devious law that wants to take away their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and chairwoman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key points of a Texas law that would have forced most of the remaining clinics in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that admission rights require doctors to impose unnecessary restrictions.
Opponents of abortion argue that the measures are aimed at protecting women’s health, although some also welcomed the effects of clinic closures.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient-instruction rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would stop performing the surgery for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the ruling, Louisiana state officials said they would not punish doctors for performing abortions while their requests for patient instruction rights were pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher rates of death from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video hommage for their mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Small Study: New Drugs Could Slow Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of the women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman’s age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing conditions, as well as social and economic status also affected survival chances.
For older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why out-of-town women were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for it.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to counter the distances, she suggested, as a possible remedy, strengthening the service of flown-in doctors to give specialists the opportunity to care for women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical status, the study revealed a poor long-term survival rate among women in ovarian cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33, learned from the Gold Coast that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden Centres Regret Declining Homeownership Rates
The decline, along with an increased drop in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today’s young consumers reach the “core age group for gardening products,” according to a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with homes spend on their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting front gardens for parking purposes and the declining garden size are other factors threatening the industry, in which an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion is put up for sale annually.
In the Greater London area, where the proportion of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditures for gardening products per household are reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living for rent or small gardens don’t mean that people can’t grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for the RHS, said: “Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them on a move.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden age” of gardening retailing due to rising homeownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital, Islamabad, around 1,000 demonstrators stormed the state-run television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters back out of PTV buildings.
The station stopped its operation for about 40 minutes, but now broadcasts again.
At the same time, some 3,000 protesters tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometre away, armed with sticks and stones, they clashed with security forces.
Police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif’s resignation, but he refused.
Meanwhile, the country’s army is urging a political solution to the conflict, “without wasting time and without resorting to violence.”
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said, “The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state.”
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been puking more often.
The opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in the parliamentary elections in May last year.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their followers to advance to Sharif’s residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey appoints US diplomat over spying report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has summoned the country’s longest-serving U.S. diplomat for information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. embassy executive and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US National Security Agency analyst, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that Germany’s most important intelligence agency also targeted Ankara caused the Turkish government to react much more infuriatingly.
Warning strike: locomotive drivers threaten with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike of the locomotive drivers on Monday evening could also affect the passenger traffic in NRW.
The cancellation, which was announced for 6 to 9 p.m., affected all transport companies nationwide, including long-distance, regional and suburban rail traffic,
The main direction of the warning strike is freight transport.

said the district chairman of the trade union German Locomotive Leader (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant outages.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike was freight transport.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it is difficult to foresee the consequences in concrete terms.
Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
The prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> to the office of the Majorcan prosecutor on Friday.
The chief of the Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> police on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested after corruption allegations by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous binge-drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after allegations of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented proof of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> to the office of Mallorca’s anti-corruption prosecutor on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are being questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners said the authorities’ nepotism had a serious impact on their businesses.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Let our livelihoods out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing fellatio to 24 men during a booze tour.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the disorderly behavior of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcohol-soaked pub crawls.
The Playhouse Club where the fellatio incident took place was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and pub tour organizer Carnage are jointly fined €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide airport
The SPRING has given South Australia a wintry surprise, with heavy showers and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 pm, another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen in the night to Sunday.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a cast that started just before 8 p.m. and caused nearly 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After winter provided an early dose of spring last week, temperatures in the city fell back to a peak of just 15.8°C on Monday.
The gushing weather conditions have likely resulted in the delayed landing of a flight from Melbourne to Adelaide by Virgin Airlines.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a sheer wind — a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance — and had to take off.
Wind gusts reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to take off on a second approach and finally set off at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay resulted in the delay of several other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: High time for great networking
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our cozy home into high-tech control centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies consoles himself with a very familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my eye falls on the spiral cable that connects the handset to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But behind this is a consideration: If the cable were not, all listeners would fly around the house in a very short time, and that would be even more retro.
Is it on the ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, typos: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the e-waste of tomorrow, bought - obsolete.
And if, for example, you still have a tube TV in the living room today, all you have to do is say that you fundamentally reject television.
Why these considerations?
Because the pressuring of the Ifa at the radio tower this week again shows us our absolute incompetence in terms of electronics.
The layman, who once blindly mastered the washing machine and CD player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread out in front of him with incredibly vain expert talk: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you okay?
What should you talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such quark?
Basically, for about 20 years, it has been mainly about the fact that we should network our house.
So that the yogurt reorders itself, so that the fire alarm on holiday in the Maldives informs us that it is burning in the study level.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we could get the air conditioning from the office to our soon arrival...?
Yes, but this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly come true soon: We lift our wristwatch, tell her out loud "sucking!" - and at home the vacuum robot starts.
Crazy.
Everything boils down to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred", an industry expert ruminates, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but this is of no use, because we are in a traffic jam.
We also know from daily practice that if a new-fashioned device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason for this is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air-raid shelters, while rocket and mortar shelling went down on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools in Gaza remained closed as the area recovered from the fighting.
The school start brought a sense of joy and anticipation to southern Israel’s rocket-launched communities, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed shrapnel from the walls and sliding walls before the arrival of the students.
"We're a little scared, but excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children in our area urgently need a return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke out last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still hesitant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town to Gaza heavily marked by Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas’ call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and UN estimates.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells at Israeli cities during the fighting, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fighting continues, last week the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year.
"I hope the school will be reopened soon so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl questions NPD ban proceedings
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has called for an end to the ongoing NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court should come to an end.
"The NPD is doing worse than last time," Strobl, who is also the head of the CDU in Baden-Württemberg, told the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me come to the conclusion that the NPD is politically opposed and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had narrowly failed in Sunday’s vote on the five percent hurdle.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party had failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection at that time also had informants in the NPD top.
In December 2013, after a long period of preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The federal government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: tents for new refugees
At Neul<0xC3><0xA4>nder Platz, refugees are now housed in tents.
The first reception centre for refugees in Harburg is bursting at the seams.
Now the Interior Ministry has set up three Red Cross tents next to it.
The district politicians were only informed shortly before - they are not very enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to stir citizens' reservations and give district politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Green Party leader in the Harburg district assembly.
Her party is demanding that the Harburg district administration make unused houses available for housing.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for the overcrowding in the first reception are the onslaught of people seeking help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely observed index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to RP data from Monday.
Due to this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data’s head of research, Tim Lawless, said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-tiered market.
RP Data’s figures show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne they rose by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
On the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices have only risen 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless further said that with the start of spring, there would now be an increase in properties for sale over the next few months, which would subject the market to “a real test.”
“If you look at the consistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sell rate, and the consistently low interest rate environment, it’s likely that home prices will continue to rise over the next three months,” he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts statements of the managing director Peer Medau and attests to him posing "like a general".
The style of the university is not that, according to the statement.
The Medau family had already been informed orally about the request of the university in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were not announced until July is definitely false," said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "pre-sets or even decisions", but that there are "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle, which is necessary for the access, is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
There was and is no mention of a nine-meter-wide road.
The current level is 5.50 metres, which is one metre wider than before," explains Pötzl.
Pötzl does not want to accept the argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will then only be used by students of the university in the future.
There is no train parking at all because, as with other public parking lots, this can now be solved intelligently.
Thinking of the Residents
The cr<0xC3><0xA8>che Bergwichtel, which is located on the site and in front of whose front door the access to the parking deck would lead, according to the university president "should not be affected".
Rather, he points out that "this is not only about the nursery, but also about the residents at the confluence with Friedrich-Streib-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e and the 800 students of the neighboring secondary school.
So it is about much more than the particular interests of Mr. Medau," said Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parental advisory board of the cr<0xC3><0xA8>che, with the expansion of the street would be justified one "of the few natural spots of Coburg" to be lost, "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Authority, wants to inform the city councils about the structural development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the cr<0xC3><0xA8>che about the plans of the university last week.
According to this, the access for the new parking deck should not lead as before over the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, but over the Medau mountain.
This would mean that the narrow road would have to be extended in two lanes over a length of about one kilometre.
According to Medaus projections, traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
There are about 2000 vehicles per day.
On the part of the city, so far, they did not want to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga SG Flensburg-Handewitt led for this decision above all health problems.
The decision was not easy for me, it has matured over several months.
It’s time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team,” the 2007 world champion said on his Facebook page.
With a record of 167 international matches and 576 goals for Germany, he is retiring internationally.
Because the throw-back player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go on a goal hunt for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new national coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who on Tuesday announced his squad for the international games against Switzerland, Glandorf had a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me just as much as they will inspire my long-time players and my successors.
But for my club I would also like to be healthy in the next few years, for this longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which the current double load does not allow.
The left-hander had to fear his career end in 2012 after a heel infection.
Because of Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone injection, which later had triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a settlement.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass by any body without a trace.
I have a few health issues that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries, which took place in short intervals in 2012, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
Here are some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year, I realized that I can control my head, but I can’t fool my body,” Glandorf told Handball Time.
For a comeback, he would only be available in an absolute emergency.
"When all the ropes are broken, I am always ready to talk," the two-time family father explained to the trade magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also became quite humble about my health.
After my career, I want to be able to walk at least somewhat straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and winning the Champions League in 2014, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012 he also secured the European Cup Winners' Cup with Flensburg.
German economy shrank by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the world slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was reported by the Federal Statistical Office, thus confirming provisional calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong start to the year, total GDP growth in the first half of 2013 was 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland Mooiste", which led on Sunday for the first time through the Burgmannsstadt.
The castle town of Horstmar experienced on Sunday an invasion of Dutch "fietszenfahrer".
The largest cycling association of the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
It is the largest cycling tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to those interested in participating in various trade journals.
We came from Den Helder and drove overnight to participate in this tour.
We would also like to get to know the Münsterland in this way," the cyclists were happy about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the clubhouse of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the rampart, where the start took place.
The route, which was advertised for three different categories, continued in the direction of Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were fed on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and deputy mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for everyone involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We'll see you again in 2015 with hopefully nice weather on August 30 or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to return to the Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's brutally honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, what Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, in "Mönch und Krieger" on 287 pages on paper.
Not chronologically, but more shreds of thought for shreds of thought, the Munich-born on June 1, 1947 has written down his memoirs, each chapter introduced by a suitable song text.
And he is ruthlessly honest: From onanie as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he leaves out no human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad space also takes up abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all this he tries to get to the bottom, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how he was shaped not only by music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also by his imprisonment.
The latter has also brought the living man Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who is created "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving out everything unnecessary".
Between all the high-spirited views, there are also short anecdotes about earthing: about fights in a restaurant frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride, in which he targeted a tree head-on.
Here, too, he is ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants living in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work his way through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown up when I was a kid - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket punch.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the paper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father's time, he did gain some insight into what life might have been like for him.
It is now a little brighter, but they are dark, smoky, deep stygian labyrinths with bursts of flame and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could slowly hear him sing because he could wash the foundry off.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had been doing this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
However, as a child, Henry grew up without his parents' testimony of love.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you".
It wasn’t until my mother was feeling bad towards the end of her life that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop saying “I love you”?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry’s career change may be reflected in his elegant, cropped beard.
Since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he has been taken over by the theatre.
It followed The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started working in a factory when he was only 16 years old.
A DJ spotted him on stage imitating people and writing to New Faces about him.
"I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while being a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager owned the stage rights to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don’t regret that I did.
It was a weird, awkward position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years-old award-winning lightweight pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing characters that both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circuit in the 1980s.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock on the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought to himself, "What do you do next, Len, because it all feels like you're just taking the time or stepping on the spot a little."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought he was mostly a middle-class domain, whites in tights and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put a few of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I had the feeling that I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right.
“That’s what it’s all about, it’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, do a little research.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that just didn’t happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he needed to entertain the audience.
“A little voice said to me, ‘You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they fix the computer.’”
Instead, the stage director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I went off the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You're in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
That too was well received, so it's like a big shield of the gods telling me "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, in a THINKING voice.
So I'll stick with it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is permeated with humorous outbursts, while he repeatedly imitates people.
I decided not to do a stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of instant gratification from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you are always looking for that, you drive it in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live at the Apollo when I feel like it, but overall it doesn’t give me as much as it used to.
I ask him if he will ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director that helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I'll ever want to give that up again.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that’s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital, Sanaa.
Houthi supporters occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Houthi party said "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media reports of a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called on Sunday evening to the measures.
According to the paper, Houthi threatened with a further escalation of the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shia Houthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and are demanding the resignation of the government.
The Houthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on the main access roads of Sanaa.
Bloody fighting with the Yemeni army continues in the countryside.
Kenya registers officials to curb ‘ghost workers’
Kenya has begun to biometrically register all state officials to remove “ghost employees” from government payrolls.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks will no longer be paid, according to a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people still receive salary payments even after they leave the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the civil service when he took office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) per month was lost in payments for “ghost employees” and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid in accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials will now have to appear at identification centers over the next two weeks to ensure their data is recorded via biometric registrations, a government message said.
Anyone who would not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the statement continued.
"This action will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of officials and also cleaning up the payroll at both levels of government - thus eliminating the 'ghost employees'," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal surrounding art consultant Helge Achenbach will be tried in court for the first time on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are seeking damages of 19.4 million euros from Achenbach and two of his companies, which are in insolvency proceedings.
A court spokeswoman said on Monday.
The application states that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and classic cars and that Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach has bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was in the school service for 44 years, 23 of them as headmaster.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many well-known Petershauseners and Kollbachers from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always driven by his aspiration to see man in the pupil.
The Schneekoppe is the most famous mountain of the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in a freight car.
So the judge went to the Upper Franconian village of Sennkendorf.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
For this, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometers to the next station six times a week, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometers across the entire city to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a sleeping accommodation in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
In 1951, he took the first state examination and in 1954, after three years as a trainee teacher, he took the second state examination.
Since Upper Franconia did not have a free teaching position for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Fr<0xC3><0xA4>ulein-Zimmer" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958, he moved into a three-room apartment next to the school in the newly built teacher's house.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school in Kollbach had been dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were combined in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so from September 1982 the children and their teachers were able to move into the present building, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had an additional workshop built at community expense and cellars built during the 1997 extension, although this was not eligible according to the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Richter remembered gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government official who responded to a speech by a school council on law and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
“You have to give the children two things: roots and wings,” says the 84-year-old.
And he had to find out: "That doesn't always work." Whether he means only his students or just his own six children is not entirely clear.
In any case, Richter’s actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students fought each other, he did not give them criminal work and they were not doomed to sit down.
At the expense of the community, Richter had purchased two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there should be a violet.
For the good of the school, Richter maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU) as rector.
After his retirement, he moved the non-partisan judge to run for the municipal council in 1996, at least as the last on the CSU list.
But Richter was selected in sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 km in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists make stopovers in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of rests alone made an impression: The 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour along with the accompanying horse enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in the Schotten Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometers via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started with his bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and Petra Schwing-Döring, head of Bad Salzhausen’s own business.
All kinds of good things had been prepared for the refreshment of body and mind: the rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, plum, crumble and cheese cake, which wonderfully fed the capable cyclists.
"Such cakes can only be baked by rural women," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be purchased at the drink stand of the gymnastics club Gei<0xC3><0x9F>-Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has reattached bike chains that have already broken off today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the plant manager still had to work: They were interviewed by reporter Rainer Janke at the well in front of the drinking spa and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Promotional director Tobias Hagen, who has been with us as a tour guide since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004, was only able to get a breath of fresh air, as he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle squadron of the Hesse police using three telephones and a radio, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but cyclists have also travelled from Gie<0xC3><0x9F>en or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacity.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
The cyclists had a good impression of the health resort when they left after an hour and a half: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were challenged in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festive atmosphere and of course they had prepared delicacies, such as tarte flambée with well-cooled feather whitener.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Ho<0xC3><0x9F>feld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his function as board member of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "much operation in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity for lively outdoor movement was eagerly used despite the sporting activity on the bike.
The guests were increasingly mixed with citizens who were just as impressed by the good mood as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the cyclists were able to visit the stations Birstein, W<0xC3><0xA4>chtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalder.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes arrived in Bad Vilbel again.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for 'conspiracy' against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government,” local media agencies report.
The police did not make an immediate comment.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal organization and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) described her actions as part of the activities led by Islamist cleric Fethulla Güllen against him and others in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people’s front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, headmaster of the Slavyansk school visiting Yatsenyuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future lives.
The first day of school of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
She arrives with a proud haul of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
She has her own frontline experience.
She began her career at global management consulting firm Bain and Co., where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearsons media world.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top post of parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Their settlement was reportedly close to <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: she became an advisor to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
As early as May, I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned chalice.
Not only does the BBC stand as a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inwards to the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwards as the voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates an almost untenable duopoly, which calls for a complete comprehensive reform.
But what new incoming chairman would risk taking on everything and disassembling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps getting himself out of his job?
It is a difficult task.
And as if that weren’t enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC scaled down – power, money and status overtaken.
As competition moves closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable collateral, the upcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC is associated with particular dangers.
For the modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public buys into what is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs each just 40 pence a day.
And apparently, the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone these days and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and considerable institution.
She needs a great leader, and I hope she finds him.
Texas’ Perry Says Declining Tweet Was Unauthorized
A tweet from Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry’s official user account on Sunday included a disparaging remark about the Democratic District Attorney, who is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another from Perry’s user account, which denied the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
“I don’t approve of the tweet and deleted it,” it said in the later message.
Perry employees did not promptly respond to requests for comments.
Although the tweets came from Perry’s official user account, it wasn’t clear who was actually serving the feed.
In the earlier tweet, an unfavorable picture was drawn of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed funding for her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment of Perry — who may be a 2016 presidential candidate — in front of a grand jury in Austin this month.
The tweet read: “I don’t always drive drunk with three times the allowable alcohol level ... but when I do, I sue Governor Perry for bawling it out.”
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not in charge of the grand jury investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.
His high-ranking team of lawyers petitioned the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the charges, arguing that the law passed against the longest-serving governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds to the state’s Public Integrity Unit — which is based in Travis County and investigating state corruption cases in Texas — when Clayberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint by a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry’s official user account is frequently updated – and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth in Iowa during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry went on to speculate that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, saying "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley Declares Housing Market ‘Normal’ Again
One of London’s most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in south-east England had “returned back to normal” levels.
Homes in the capital were in high demand and subject to huge price increases, prompting the Bank of England to set ceilings for mortgage loans in June due to widespread fears of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of high-class construction company Berkeley, said Monday: “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since its 2013 peak,” adding that this provides a “stable action environment.”
The real estate market in London was well-positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the cadastral office, prices in the urban area alone have risen by 18.5 percent in the past year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Average retail prices at Berkeley’s private, low-cost and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year, to <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate ownership in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months — some of whom have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a possible “villa tax” ahead of next May’s general election.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which featured tougher lending arrangements, would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday shows a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also suggests the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, revised its forecast for the rise in London property prices for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on an already-weakening house price awareness.
Transaction volume in London’s most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now declined by a quarter year after year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Still, the desire for a home in the capital is a boon for Berkeley, as the amounts due for future sales amount to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added, “Demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, forward sales have also remained stable.”
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April – almost a third more than at its peak in 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax income increased by 40 per cent to <0xC2><0xA3>280 million, with sales up 18 per cent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
In a statement Monday ahead of the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that revenue for Berkeley this year is expected to be in line with current market expectations.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley shares stood at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in London trading in the afternoon.
Jennifer Lawrence Nude Photos Revealed By Hackers On The Internet
Jennifer Lawrence at the 85th Academy Awards.
Naked photos of Academy Award winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a “master list” of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real and accused the hacker of "excuseful violation of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will pursue all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, originally posted on the photo-sharing site 4chan, were allegedly obtained through a gap in Apple’s online storage system iCloud, and the alleged “master list” of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It’s not certain how many of the images are real, though Winstead, star of “Scott Pilgrim vs. the Rest of the World” on Twitter also denounced the hack.
“To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house – I hope you are really happy with you,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickelodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are FALSE, people.
Let’s start at the beginning. *wordplay intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They flowed apart, that’s the best way to describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard box that was left standing in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distant, and perhaps a little scratchy.
Then he shook his hand.
He knew scratching brush.
He was prickly, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this stinginess was a just-beginning affair, which had been more promising in relieving the solitary boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a shiveringly delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rugged than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion whom Kevern thought was her aunt, and who had inherited a plot of land in a humid but paradisiacal valley aptly named Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaky, spiders were still in the baths, slugs had left their marks on all the windows and believed they were all theirs, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge cabbages.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both menacing and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding hands on the broken deckchairs in the tall grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, both of whom had retreated to the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news when the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - Nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolesized, as well as the word obsolesize.
The general taste created what edicts and regulations had never achieved, and just as people choose books from the washer-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks, and romance novels, so they chose ballads for music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and singing Ailinn’s big feet in a grossly comic Serenade.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before it came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, he had said.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it costs you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game back then, and it wasn’t very fun now either.
He knew this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz, although not directly banned, was not played.
Improvisation is no longer modern.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
Likewise the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father’s semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn’t remember a time when pop singers weren’t black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group gifting – grateful as those spared by fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent were fit for entertainment and sports by temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as if by nature and were tasked with ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewers; what was left of the Greeks smashed up Teller.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly when WHAT HAPPENED WAS HAPPENING, for fear of being accused of fomenting fires, for fear even that the flames would consume them next, had opened up the Labneh and Shisha pipes restaurants, and the unpressurized ones were contemplating.
Each according to his abilities.
Hearing only ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the offensive words Kevern had just sung to her could ever be set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers to the lips in her presence again.
She thought he was a little weird anyway.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern’s sight.
There was nothing else to be seen all over the world but her uncombed raven-black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say so," she means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed genuinely worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked at me again.
Your feet are not so straight.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your big ankles are exactly why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little bit perverse.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got himself into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the comforting charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to be.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and rose from her deck chair, threw the console over and spilled the wine they had drunk.
Elderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, like palm fronds in the storm.
"And your fat head is exactly why I'm pervertedly attracted to you," she said...
Except I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and for the fear that was shown in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he was going to beat her?
She had not told him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here as it did on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more despondent for WHAT HAPPENED than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise a hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a fat fist if she wasn't careful!
They first make love – Knutschen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the meaningless love ballads from the console – they first make love and then beat.
In Kevern’s view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the crafting itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He got out of the chair like an old man.
She also felt leaden, but the force of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him move away, just as her companion was watching him from a room on the upper floor, a man weighed down by something he himself had conjured up.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was this a sight she seemed to know well, when she could not remember a single time when she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just narrated, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, worked on a short lecture on the continued violence at low and middle levels in precisely those parts of the country in which its reduction, if not abolition, would have been most likely to be expected, in view of the funds and energy expended.
“A lot has already been done, and much still needs to be done,” she wrote, “to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that has waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness was historically rarely felt despite the towering church towers between the hedges.
But some characteristics turn out to be ineradicable.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the lower the passion it continues to arouse.
The population weeps while listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicates themselves with stories of overcome difficulties, and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, yet not only does the former rawness hold rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in their hands, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and devious quarrelsome addiction at home, at work, even on the streets and fields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said as he read the full report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Again, Esme invoked her right to privacy and denial of the statement.
- Feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz, finally, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
This is an unbiased workplace.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and commendable, can occasionally distort results as you imagined them to be.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you describe as “backward” and “raw” might as well be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural strength and vitality.
Continuing to ride around on what has happened, when it has happened, as if it had happened yesterday, means taking away from the country its essential vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given to the country over the last quarter century or more.
Smile at their neighbors, appreciate their partner, listen to ballads, attend musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you're trying to get at," Esme Nussbaum replied in a calm voice, when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I'm not saying anything but that we're not as effectively cured as we're pretending to be.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that only happened when it happened.
This time, however, it is not the others that we let out our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To suggest an angelic patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you refer to actions as 'mistakes' that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far in saying that they would have left out their “anger” and their “distrust” of “others.”
It shouldn’t actually be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past, as in protecting the present, we’re not talking about “us” and “others.”
There was no "we" and there were no "others".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"Of which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme ventured, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not charging anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what happened has happened.
That was then.
Nothing more needs to be said - we agree on that.
And just as there is no need to assign blame, there is no need to redeem blame if such redemption is appropriate and if there is a way to redeem it.
But what is the use of the past if we do not learn from it -
The past is for us to forget.
If I can say anything about that -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider your report," he said and dismissed her.
The next day, as she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had driven into a sort of "brutal rage" on the footpath.
There are coincidences.
Lesotho Military Member Says No Coup Is Planned; Prime Minister Remains in South Africa
Officials from the military in Lesotho denied planning a coup to overthrow the government and said they were taking action against police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the country’s army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no coup de facto, but that the military was responding to the threat posed by “political fanatics” whose arming was imminent by the police.
“What happened this morning was that the staff of the Lesotho Defense Forces acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there were some elements operating within the police that actually wanted to arm some of the political, partisan young fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc,” he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a coup.
“While no one has claimed to have usurped the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho’s defence forces so far show signs of a coup,” he said.
Lesotho military spokesmen said Sunday that the soldiers were retreating to their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said he believes he has been targeted for his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
Tensions have been high in Lesotho since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to clashes in his unity government.
He said his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Eurozone production at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed to its lowest point in the last 13 months in August, according to a closely watched study.
The final Markit Purchasing Managers' Index of Manufacturing (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
A figure above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined and factories experienced slumps at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures arrive ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets expect the bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone, as well as the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could give further details later this week as to whether he is considering a quantitative relief for the eurozone, according to those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the restraining effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more evident to manufacturers,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc’s second-largest economic nation, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as does Italy’s decline from solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism are no longer effective in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands is also not reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index is that after that, the sector continues to grow.”
He added: “Euro-zone producers are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions – especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine – increase uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy, in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, particularly large orders.
He said that it is “increasingly likely” that the ECB will eventually have to introduce some type of QE, “although we suspect that this will be limited.”
The hell decade of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children entangled in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom atrocity.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom atrocity.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now afflicting Ukraine – and in which children like them die – is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to climb back into the school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she only tried to climb back into the school gym in her underwear after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought to be dead, but they survived.
“A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought them to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she felt completely healed, but said yesterday, "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'll have to have another operation.
Some shrapnel is still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it didn’t break me,” she says wistfully.
“This happened to me, and you can’t change that.
Once a year I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I’ll think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory gets a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me climbing back to school online, I think a lot of people see it for the first time, understand our disaster, and help prevent something like this from happening again.
The boy who ran through the hail of bullets thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Afraid that she might be dead, he fled and saw a crying infant on the way, seized it by the hand, and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who held his son in his arms outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside with leg injuries at the hospital, in the belief that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now-disbanded News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's getting paler in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that’s no problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard who didn't make it outside.
We never say they were killed or are dead.
We say that they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could choose anything I wanted, and the trip in an open-top car.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the atrocities," said Damir, who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery.
I'm so happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London were crying when I told our story.
At the time, I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and me helped.
I still remember how Damir liked to eat Borshch and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot at them with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think that this world hasn't gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is continuing now, and people are dying every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are kids like ours.
I think for many, war is part of the news they hear when they’re bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he has six close friends from class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it—I remember him sometimes lying down on the sofa, his face turned away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, taller than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can’t believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
As I recovered from the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around and saw hell all around me, with body parts lying all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not possibly have survived in this hell.
"I remember calling out to him, 'Damir, run, run away,' but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike that of many others, continues for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image became the symbol of the abominations of Beslan after the siege
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-stained face was scarred as he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she hurried off to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three horrible days," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date gets, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I mean it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from those days are always haunting me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise.
The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school so badly that day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I didn't know he was alive until I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of crying Georgy in San Marino.
Georgij does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden in our home in the bookcase.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People keep investigating such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is becoming something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because when you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing at all with such pain.
It takes dozens of years to forget a little.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That’s why I always go to the gym as September 1 approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and attend a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not going to happen.
Georgy Faniyev, 20
The Boy Who Survived Even Though He Was Caught at the Feet of a Murderous Terrorist
A miracle: Georgy Faniyev was trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gym, sitting next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
“We feel it as if it had been yesterday,” says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's not something I've left behind.
I’m older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences – I have to say, that’s not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better afterwards, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is immense and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB’s intelligence academy in Saint Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent in my documents, including the medical records, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said: “I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about it and they should of course not suffer from it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, “This pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the celebrations to remember.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be much more intense for him because he was there and I wasn’t.
I waited for him at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back to me. Here in Beslan, everyone is drawn from it.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He was operated on several times, he can walk, but not play sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always haunt us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and that only adds to my pain.
I have lost many people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart weeps for the dead.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life will go on, even if you don’t want it to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped inside me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more are being killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskayeva, 10
The baby so poignantly carried to safety by a special task force
Rescued: Alyona Tskaeva is taken to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in their cruelty kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar back in the school gym.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona’s mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has with his new wife Svetlana a little girl whom he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
“They are a big happy family now and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man Accused of Running Over Girls on Pedestrian Crossing in Fife

Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, denied the accusation in Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the proceedings for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all available at a price below $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set your camera to the photos or videos you want to capture.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize exposure time for the dampest underwater conditions.
And before you jump into it, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only approved for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose pictures, action cams usually don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to view this underwater, and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So take a lot of shots.
If your camera has a series mode that allows you to take a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you move away from the surface.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake, or ocean.
This also allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important underwater because of the poor lighting conditions.
It’s especially important when you’re working with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you’ll need to get closer to your objects if you want them to fill in the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As a consultant anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to the task of saving the patient both the agony of the disease and the agony of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors care about diagnoses and diseases, while those treated are predominately preoccupied with something else entirely: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
“I didn’t feel,” he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble picking myself up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently blaming his wife Juliet.
“I’d rather do it immediately than later,” he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusually and unsettled for no reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest.
Just two weeks ago, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the pectoral skin, i.e. the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have been smokers before.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered a "miracle substance" but has now been recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a condition that can be ignored as easily.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry volunteered to stop using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another era, it hardly seems worrying today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the peak of a mesoltheliome epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999) is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former construction workers.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the stores we shop in.
And therefore, mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no shelter.
The parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to get well, this deadly carcinogen has already been identified as the starting point.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
In fact, it was hard for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I trained for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was at least partially able to answer this question.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who have contracted mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one alive."
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at age 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatally.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will still get sick?”
The UK’s leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to come to a standstill, a total of 90,000 will have fallen victim to the disease.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A quick look at the files of the courts, to which the persons concerned often turn because of claims for damages, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma has already spread.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to having negligently exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations, one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children in her twenties.
"Before this," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would ever affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to one substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It has been used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is still considered by the EU and WHO as a “major health risk” with possible death.
However, the brown asbestos (amosite) and the blue asbestos (crokydolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that “there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates.”

Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto’s work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected, which shows that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma without known exposure to exposure through work or in the home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Many of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It seems that no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of the government, may have been unwittingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipes behind Parliament’s committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be stirred up by something as harmless as “strong air movements.”
Members of parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion of work has to be spent over several years to renovate the Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, MPs will likely meet in the nearby QE2 Conference Centre in Westminster rather than the Greens.
The Goddard report also pointed out that “the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective regulations.”
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who has never been able to accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos lawsuits were decided positively,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It’s so hard to remember all the places you’ve worked and the data.
What he still remembers is the day in early December 2009, when he got a kind of fever.
He was 45 and had surgery late at night.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make the trip home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the chest skin, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
He didn’t go to work for a month.
Surprising doctors took x-rays of his chest and used pleural catheters to extract fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without a diagnosis.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to work.
However, from time to time, symptoms returned, often after exercise and vigorous breathing.
In 2011, a patient named Abbott came to his practice with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the cave between the ribbed and chest skin.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
To be honest, I wasn’t so worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to get a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the scale of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now becoming ill.
And so mesothelioma now affects younger people who have not worked in the typical occupations.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably more likely not to be exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely to come into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students placed their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it’s not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Also schools.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Across the country, in thousands of chemistry lessons, students have put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently discussed on websites.
And meanwhile, such innocent items in our homes as floor slabs or shed roofs contain asbestos by default.
"It's an industrial poison that's contained in large parts of our real estate," notes Andrew Morgan, the attorney who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So watch how you tear down your garden shed.
The impact of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
“It takes a while to process that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
The greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to cope with.
“It was very hard to take it all in,” he says.
"I asked my doctor, 'How long have I got?'
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism—breathing itself—that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is whirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the chest skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest skin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac thorax physician who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects exposed him to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others, who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, “they are pushed by the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
By nature, it is invasive from the very beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work as well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hotly contested.
Some think it’s worth a try.
Treasure denies this.
"You can't cut out the pectoral fur," he says.
They can't get around it with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect," but does not cure.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counseling agency for fellow sufferers four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he cheerfully introduced himself on calls.
“He was very positive,” Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last four months and would only extend his life by one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage in that I didn't have to be referred, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and wait for approval of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to be able to perceive the best therapies available.
But when these treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers stand by another financial concern — about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It’s been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health,” Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that even a very small burden posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls a "full compensation," as Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation into his death, a spokesman for Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation, assigning the deadly asbestos contact to a company or workplace—usually decades after the incidents—is a huge problem.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed down.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is right for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there have been clear new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to seek compensation, even if their previous employers are no longer available.
The law has set up an insurance industry-sponsored fund of <0xC2><0xA3>350 million for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have awarded them in a normal damages process – about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications to the program are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million was a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
“This is a deal by insurers for insurers,” he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time hadn’t passed and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Secretary of Labor and Pensions, also admitted that the law was “not perfect.”
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven deaths a day, rapid action was needed.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the mesothelioma law in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which, unlike Tom Treasure, he expects a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy – a triple therapy that allows Lang-Lazdunski to present a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
“Of course, that’s the most important thing,” Abbott says.
You see this over and over again in patients.
There’s something that makes you go on.
When you give up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
This is not life-threatening.
That's life-ending.
Again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
No trace of the tumor is visible anymore.
But the process is physically and psychologically very exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I am no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you become negative.
You have to look ahead.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it’s not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease that I would not grow old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma sufferers, such conversations are not permeated by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as in the end also for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China Denies Hong Kong Right to Government Election, Protesters Swear Retribution
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This move is believed to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists initiated planning and mobilization to do so within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People’s Congress basically allows Communist leaders to reject all non-Beijing candidates.
“It’s not unexpected, but it makes us angry,” said law expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
People in Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, vice-secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, said that admitting public nominations in the elections would be too “chaotic” for the Hong Kong government.
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let residents vote for the government’s presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong citizens a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is keeping a tight grip on the process through a Beijing-controlled nominating committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most public protests in Hong Kong have taken place in several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not allow genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside Hong Kong’s government headquarters within hours of the announcement.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online message, the organizers said that the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for days for Beijing’s announcement, and there were tougher security measures in front of the government building on Sunday, including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is amplified by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong’s values of democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crumble under Beijing’s growing pressure.
Some criticized the Occupy Central movement’s demonstrations for endangering business operations – Hong Kong’s lifeline.
“The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage depending on how many are involved and how long they last,” said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to raise any fears that Hong Kong is going out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported on Hong Kong’s democracy activists as Western-controlled subversive agents.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on suffrage, attended by 780,000 people — more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
The tradition of high school graduation balls in the USA is now being transferred to universities, where freshmen performances are offered by private jet.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and offer the UK’s first luxury travel service for today’s students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to drive their belongings around the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the University this year with a minimum of effort and maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said there were no new bookings as the service had just been introduced, but added that “students will be booking the service in the next few weeks.”
The company also said that despite tuition fees of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 per year, it expects a market for this offering.
Students today are very different in their expectations and aspirations from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago – it’s more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as off-limits.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students starting their studies this month face a cost-of-living crisis as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships don’t keep up with the soaring bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at the dorm.
Feminists Criticize Racial Question and Police Behaviour After Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
Participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, as tensions rose in the Midwest and gained attention across the country, Perez saw that white women’s responses revolved 100% around race.
Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shootings, the personal essays with titles such as “Thoughts on Ferguson from a White Woman” and “Feminism isn’t just about the oppression of women” came relatively late.
But for Perez, that was an important change.
"I don't think you'll find a lot of people in feminism talking about being white and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt pressured to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we find ourselves in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans face every day, but are not considered “women’s issues” in cultural space.
“I can post something funny about myself and my partner on Facebook and get 150 likes from everywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
“How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about safety in public space?” she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the issues cleanly; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women are now connecting the issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the rationale was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came to the point where white women campaigners for women’s suffrage like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for suffrage could only succeed for one group at a time: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand up for women's suffrage, and blacks' suffrage should come later," Hattery said.
When one remembers such things, one becomes powerfully aware of why women of color don’t trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group emerged nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the tide of white feminist responses to Ferguson’s issues—police behavior, racial discrimination—is a mirror of the time when white feminists “catch” the issues that black women have been grappling with for generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to control conception?” asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
“I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body — and opinions on race that are markedly different in public polls — will lead the changes,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which racial as well as gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on the racial issue in America are baffled.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of “Who Stole Feminism?” told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are “far more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Steinem’s comments on Ferguson are in contrast to her previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother’s Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is thrusting itself into the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. Border Police picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country’s southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform is once again coming to the surface – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that in order to reimagine the issue as an essential women’s issue, she only had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women accompanying them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are echoing in women's organizations," she said.
"Schweine-Haus" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a big pig making itself comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is situated on a private road in Ipswich and is offered for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which also included a pig that had its head laid on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner’s pet.
"However, the photo was erroneously released and has since been removed," a company spokeswoman said.
In the house’s exposé, Connells described the former assembly house as a “unique one-bedroom single-family home.”
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The house sale sparked interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A Lotto Player from Harvey is Coming This Month
The search for a new millionaire in southwest Perth continues, with one lucky winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from Saturday’s lottery draw.
A newsstand in Harvey drew the jackpot in the first division draw for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner has yet to report.
Shop owner Steve Forward said the profit was fueling conversation in the small town in southwest Perth.
The city doesn't talk about anything else, and everyone's pretty excited.
We thought such a win could happen.
Eight WA winners celebrated first division wins last month, a fitting conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of five millionaires in August after a Belmont couple made the $7.5 million mega win just weeks earlier.
The winning pair had been playing for twenty years and said the win allowed them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas went to the Gladiator Arena.
Not only the gladiators stood ankle-deep in the mud at the first Rheinbach Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumn cold and were completely inspired by the historical spectacle.
There was a colourful array of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial combat squad of the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", who used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and successively sent his men into the ring for heroic duel in various gladiator genres.
At first the "provocators" were in turn with a rectangular shield and short sword as well as a leg splint on the left leg and arm splint on the right arm.
This was followed by the "Essedarii" with breast shield, short sword and throwing lance as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who with throwing net, trident and dagger competed against the "Secutor" and after a short fight pushed the lad to the ground.
Then the swords clashed metallically, the shields shrivelled, and the launchers flew surging through the arena, so that a fear and anxiety could be for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, always had an attentive eye for them.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of Roman times tangible," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friends of the Roman Canal Circle", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city for one day, as Vice-Mayor Claus Wehage stated in his greeting.
After all, the Romans not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of this were also to be admired at Roman Day, for example "aqueduct marble" from the eleven-meter-high and 1400-meter-long Roman Canal Bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus-Gesellschaft confronted the water and energy supply once and now, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time".
This is also confirmed by graduate surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger of the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the hot air heating that once heated the Römervilla.
Also impressive are the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay before they were burned.
In 2011, the Landesverband Rheinland’s Landesdenkmalpflege office had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Gewerbepark Nord in Rheinbach.
They had found surrounding walls of a farm building with a kiln for drying grain and for malting.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
She presented a number of finds from these excavations in a glass display case, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the Germanic invasion of the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
With her, the children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names like the Roman students once did with metal pens on wax tablets.
At the Römertherme Zülpich booth, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, make glass mosaics at the booth of the Rheinbach Glass Museum and use a heavy wheat mill made of stone at the booth of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Centre to grind the flour for a flatbread or a muesli.
With the faithfully reproduced Roman travel car pulled by two cold-blooded people, the visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed by the impressive stand of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Rhineland-wide Roman Year 2014, which is supposed to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the Heimat- und Geschichtsvereinen as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnerschaftsverein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and commemorate the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionnaire will tell about his work on the draughty Wachtberg, introduce plants as living monuments from Roman times and offer a funny lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and drawn Romans.
The Adendorf primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Römerwoche, the numerous, but often no longer visible at first glance traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be experienced again.
In the Wachtberg town hall, a small presentation will commemorate the discovery of the Berkum Matron Shrine in 1879.
Ebola: Epidemic Affects West Africa's Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned – and international companies are at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is hitting West Africa’s economy hard.
The harvest rots in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has hit the region hard.
Some international companies are also moving away.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one,” said African Development Bank chief Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest hit
“It’s a total disaster, we’re losing a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes at the second-largest market in Liberia’s capital, Monrovia.
The only people on the market are those who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola.
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus, and more than 600 people have died.
Recently, health authorities said the disease had penetrated into every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people died, and thousands more were infected.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Companies are suspending their operations everywhere in resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers are also reacting: only a few merchants are still leaving their home towns to get supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export rot in the fields, among other things.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
“People will travel less and less,” says Philippe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert on West Africa’s economy.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables prefers to stay at home.
The population is therefore directly and urgently affected by the consequences of the epidemic: food is becoming scarce.
In the markets, the supply of staple foods such as rice is dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, threatens to damage its image – with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies generally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
It is important to know how far and how long the virus will spread.
"Investors may have the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest," Hugon said.
The disease also affects the strained state budgets of the states
The disease also puts a strain on the already strained state budgets of the affected states.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be severely strained by the high expenditure on the health system and in addition by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few cases of Ebola have been diagnosed so far.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not been affected so far.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of being infected.
Reservations in hotels are also falling significantly.
Shooters celebrate their 50th anniversary
The shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
Preparations for the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the shooting association Tannenwald are in full swing from 12 to 14 September.
On Friday, September 12, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker" is planned.
On Saturday at 6 p.m. is the big Böllerschie<0xC3><0x9F>en.
Afterwards in the big marquee is the mood evening with the "Stoapfalzer Spitzbuam".
The band takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the big pageant at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the Federal and Gau shooting.
The 25 festive ladies with their dirndls will be a particularly beautiful sight.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker have taken over the patronage.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" comes from the year 1907, when on 21 March the association for "social entertainment by means of exercise in room-style and small-caliber shooting" was founded.
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who on 30 April in Gasthaus Lukas raised the "new" shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau from the christening.
Karl M<0xC3><0xA4>rz and Adolf Ried led the club through a difficult initial period, in which it was mainly about finding a club venue and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965 the Schützenverein started in the Gasthaus "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sport shooters, which were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records tumbled every year and the magical limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club venue "Leininger" no longer met the requirements of a modern shooting club, the board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domicile in the cellars of the new "Landgasthof H<0xC3><0xA4>rteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours, on 8 May 1988 Father Strasser gave the church blessing for the new shooting rooms.
One of the great highlights in the club's history was certainly the 44th Gauschie<0xC3><0x9F>en, combined with the solemn consecration of the new Schützenfahne in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995 a group was formed.
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A big challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the organization of the Bavarian Böller meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association have modernized the rooms and the shooting range in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought it up to date with the latest technology.
Eleven teams in round competitions
The sporting achievements of the Schützenverein can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams currently participate in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one sports pistol KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has advanced from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the Bezirksliga 1 in the round 2013/14.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as archery, carnival and royal ball, club trip and Christmas party have a tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivals in the parish and community.
Tony Stewart Suffers Accident Upon Return to Race Track
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended about halfway through his race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst in lap 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team boss Chad Johnston said his 14-strong team was disappointed, but is now focusing on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had had a better bet and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We are going to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier in Sunday’s race after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went into it today with pretty good hopes for a good result," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart’s car was loaded into the tug and the team had packed and was ready to depart.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ashtray race in northern New York state.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a spot in the chase.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped onto the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities said Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart should face prosecution.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart had already made it into the top 10 shortly after and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in lap 122, Buschs
Car with the No. 18 out of control after exiting Turn 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars heading towards the wall.
Stewart continued, but dropped back to 21st place.
Looking for a dance-loving youngster
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and head Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to fellow competitors.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups on TV Jahn have to deal with all-day lessons at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have become severely decimated.
Now more and more young people are looking for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you feel like dancing, you can get a taste of the training session on Thursdays between 5 pm and 6 pm or on Fridays between 5 pm and 6.30 pm in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistra<0xC3><0x9F>e 9, without obligation.
“The training regularly starts with a warm-up program,” says the trainer.
After that, different choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no set form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, conviviality is not neglected either.
"We also go out for dinner, watch dance films and we have also stayed in the dance room," reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If you don’t like jazz dancing, you can also get a taste of one of TV Jahn’s other offerings.
On Wednesdays, children and young people can get a taste of the lessons in the areas of children’s dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you feel like playing Discofox, Slow Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you can come and join in.
Bulgarian prison guards protest across the country
Hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been symbolically protesting against the new working hours for a month and are demanding a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, reported the national Bulgarian Ratio (BNR).
Negotiations are ongoing, said the Director-General for the implementation of punitive measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov to the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the Union of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters are still on the rise.
After heavy fighting, in which allegedly Russian tank battalions were involved, the Ukrainian army has today, Monday, the airport of the rebel stronghold Luhansk abandoned.
At the same time, the army announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the supreme army leadership, without giving details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists have shot down another fighter plane and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in clashes in the Donetsk region, the insurgents said on Monday, according to Russian agencies.
Coast Guard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two Ukrainian Coast Guard boats in the Sea of Azov for the first time.
Ukraine’s border guards confirmed that two of its ships had come under fire near the port city of Mariupol on Sunday.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told 112.ua.
Two crew members were reported missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had taken control of several villages in the Donetsk region.
Military offensive in Minsk
The Ukraine Contact Group is meeting today in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all actors used their performances to publicly announce their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday that NATO is adhering to the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of “a gross breach” of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side indicate that they regard us as opponents.
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced plans to strengthen NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe.
A “Readiness Action Plan” to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that “we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as necessary,” Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to settle their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, said the Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak on Monday.
The European Union is still waiting for a decision on whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Due to the dispute over the price of gas, Ukraine has not received fuel from Russia for weeks.
Recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had brokered between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe obtains about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks word of power: toll will come "clearly"
The Chancellor is now making a clear commitment to this.
However, it is not a license for all complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the car toll have made the CSU increasingly angry.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken after ongoing resistance from her CDU a power word for the introduction of a car toll.
“To be very clear: she is in the coalition agreement, and she will come,” the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU’s top committees in Berlin.
However, Merkel did not commit to a detailed model for the time being.
In the black-red government program, "certain parameters" are mentioned.
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal, and that is now being worked on.
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble (CDU) is also constructively involved in the deliberations for a bill.
In addition to the topic, he spoke with Dobrindt about further possibilities to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, for example in broadband expansion.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is testing its own concept to compensate motorway investors with toll revenues - after the election in 2017.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU vice-president Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed that all district and federal roads would be tolled," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU country chairman.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will speak again on the subject.
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU state associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is fears that a toll will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty because of the toll criticism from the CDU.
The Left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," party leader Bernd Riexinger told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which is to start in 2016.
According to the coalition agreement, domestic car owners may not be charged additionally.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll through the car tax.
However, the model may not discriminate against foreign drivers because of their nationality under EU law.
Genetic disorders often misdiagnosed
One Briton says she thought she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth believing that she had only a few years left to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) — a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Around 23,000 people in the UK are thought to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsafe gait and curved toes.
Sufferers also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich ataxia (FA), a disease with very poor survival.
Rodgers thought she would be in a wheelchair before she turned 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same as the others.
I fell down constantly and everything took longer with me.
I could never skate or skateboard with the other kids and was often teased at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone this, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and panicked terribly.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and slowly lose all my skills in between.
I did it all by myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities had not diminished as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have that, or you'd be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After several genetic tests, she was diagnosed with CMT.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner,” she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworker since the closure of the former military training area
For almost ten years, there have been no more shootings on the former military training ground in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, deadly munitions still appear every month in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere reserve.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on the spot.
A deafening bang echoes over the heart of the biosphere during the blasts.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was fired at the Münsingen military training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6,500-hectare site has been the centrepiece of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated trails.
Tax burden on businessmen in the Washington area rises with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for businesses in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and firms in the Washington area were no exception.
Businesses in the District, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local agencies in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local corporate tax burden rose 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining notices in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by services agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from corporations.
Virginia has the lowest corporate tax revenue at 28%.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to a rebound in companies’ real estate values, the researchers say, which led to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after the three consecutive years of growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of these gains came from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the process also seems to apply to the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 — an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in property values in Maryland is not as effective at increasing state and local tax revenues, as property taxes here amount to just over a fifth of corporate tax returns.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
“In Maryland, much of the real estate, particularly in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that don’t pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to be able to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery in the real estate market
Business earnings also appear to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took in $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the region’s highest amount.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden for businesses does not rise evenly in all three places.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 percent to the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes in all three areas, at 6% (there are fixed corporate tax rates in all three).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the District at relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia requires lower state and local corporate taxes and overall a better tax climate than Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed laws lowering its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate is set to drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they are therefore paying more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people — a transitional structure by which most small businesses are organized — in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with general surplus tax revenues for the state and local governments increasing by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government’s spending cuts affect the labor market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer has an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wants a brewery and is also hoping for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's twin city of Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
“We would be very happy if a German brewery settled in our city,” said the deputy party secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting an SPD delegation in his city.
In the course of the conversation, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China repeatedly came back to this concern of the metropolis of 12 million people.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, Li said.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would be looking for a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joie de vivre," he added at the lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joie de vivre already radiated Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the official from Guangzhou toasted with Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-Gümbel - but with red wine, which was served to the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German Purity Law.
More business transactions
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said deputy party chief Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but it was cancelled in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," said the local politician convinced.
"Business traffic between our two cities continues to increase".
Currently, travelers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the flight connection.
The vice governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, emphasized this wish in his talks with the Social Democrats.
"That's a very good idea," Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-Gümbel - the Chinese deputy minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, answered in agreement.
Well-maintained partnership
The affable vice-party leader of Guangzhou hopes that he can visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He did not take office until this year, after his predecessor had been removed from office on corruption charges.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The crackdown on Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against party and administration corruption, which is being harshly enforced by Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the carmaker VW built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9000 kilometers away, is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
With its economic power, the South China metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse.
Next year, it wants to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Joan Rivers' family "thumbs up"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was admitted to a hospital in New York City three days ago; however, her daughter today expressed hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We all keep our fingers crossed.
Her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital Thursday following an emergency for cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
Doctors keep them sedated on purpose and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as "serious."
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
More stringent environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that will be available on the market from today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will be given a label from September 1 on which the buyer can see at a glance central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, sharper nitrogen oxide values apply in the "Euro 6" pollutant class.
In addition, there is more money for scaffolding builders: They receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer — and video producer, and a host of other things — is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service for a cool billion-dollar deal was settled, and the collaboration also seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service — a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their masterpieces in games, a “YouTube for live games,” according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which know-it-alls give the (mostly older) games a touch of secret science theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken a little bored, a textbook example of an established tech company buying up a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn’t come about, as the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know right now is this statement from Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster.”
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to exercise than watch, it’s hard to grasp the attraction that comes from watching others play instead of taking control of the console themselves.
It’s one thing to look over a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something completely different, watching a lunatic get shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You can watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But unless a game or humor virtuoso is involved, his Twitch channel is probably not that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about this?
Twitch is viewed by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic spikes.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch being integrated into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have easily swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something every company would love to have: thousands of young men being wooed as advertisers.
As Twitch chairman Shear said, Amazon and Twitch “both believe in the future of gaming,” and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even—swallow—as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the bouncy castle at the Burggartenfest on Saturday.
The concept of the organizers was right.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden.
At times, the entrance had to be stopped.
“That was annoying,” said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzwedel castle garden should radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, the fun comes on its own anyway.
This was already evident on early Saturday, when the first visitors set out for open air.
The organizers had promised a festival for all generations.
And they succeeded.
Salzwedelers, but also guests from the near and far surroundings had made themselves comfortable around the supply stalls on the Burggartenwiese.
They followed the first live performances, rocked with their feet to the beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were on the agenda.
And that across generations.
While some were lounging on the blankets on the extra-carved white sand at the beach bar, others were feasting on a quarter of wine in the wine shop, the offspring raged on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But the volunteers also had to do all their hands in the truest sense of the word in order to master the rush and conjure imaginative creations into the little faces.
The bigger ones used the foosball tables or took part in a skateboard workshop hosted by the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he rattled down on the visitors, especially families looking for the vastness and dryness.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not detract from this.
“There were more people coming than expected,” said Ron Sem, who spoke of a “success across the board.”
Therefore, there is nothing to prevent a repeat of the big party next year.
Although there is still work to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear to the popular vote in a first balance sheet on Sunday.
He said it was annoying that the entrance had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little force.
The result: Some who had already paid, did not come to the site.
The response was very good.
In an initial cautious estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors, who cavorted in the castle garden.
There were problems with the sound technology.
The Salzwedel hip hop band Blocks<0x60>n<0x60>Rox broke off their performance therefore unnerved.
The technicians were not able to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned hookah lounges could not be set up because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a puncture.
“They will be there next year,” the organiser said.
The premiere of the Amula Open-Air was more than successful from the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will be forgiven the first time, but will have to be eliminated in the second edition.
The organizers also have to take criticism on the social network Facebook.
"Sorry, but you just expected more for twelve euros," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you took over a bit," says Ele Zimmermann at the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems as closely.
I find it very good that some not only talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on the feet.
Hats off!", writes Stephanie Jenss to the amula.
Now the organizers have a year to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg’s landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready-to-use component is waiting to be inserted into the striking structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the space observation radar TIRA was established, the envelope, the so-called radome, is completely renewed.
With a diameter of 47.5 meters, the new Radom will be slightly smaller than the old one.
The size, however, still remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new cover is cap swapping
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell is put on.
If the weather is good, the action will take place at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge dislocated Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket challenge went awry.
A woman was hospitalized after she screamed so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I was doing that, my jaw simply stopped," she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but I couldn’t, the jaw was hooked, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this too and almost got in their pants with laughter, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was admitted to the hospital to have the jaw re-indented after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon be pulling together again?
Recently, there was a constant conflict between the two Wolfratshaus castle associations.
Now the board members are thinking about a possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of Wolfratshauser Burg, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in the French Guédelon.
Just a year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunden Wolfratshausen.
Until now, the positions on how to deal with the history of Wolfratshauser Burg and a possible reconstruction seemed to be very different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks are to be held soon about a joint approach.
The board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) confirm this on request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit down," Sjöberg said.
In his view, all members of both clubs could pull together again in the future.
Thus, visible successes can be seen more quickly.
While the friends of the castle around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had an eye until the last reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, for the castle association around Sjöberg the "development and experience" of the site is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, Second Chairman of the Friends of the Castle, was very pleased with the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been in charge of the castle's friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we let the club's activities rest for the first time out of respect. This "thinking phase" was necessary to "consider how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go into conversation with the castle association.
Until then, the castle friends could also get a current mood picture within their grouping.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself". He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer would like to continue to work on the project "but very much like to continue".
In Piffl’s view, the different points of view regarding reconstruction will probably remain in place in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the rebuilding of the castle.
Two similar, already well-advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Due to the high participation of the population and volunteers from all over the world, they are a magnet for tourists.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at first.
But as time went on, I became more and more convinced that it would make sense to push the project forward, and that it would be possible to create a unique selling point for the rafter city.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard" He hopes that the Burgverein might be a little moved on this point.
Their goal, to document the story first, "is important and good".
After that, you could see on.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, almost second-semester student Matt Schroeder thought of a clever savings idea.
He invented a loan system for books from students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
“My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A cookie,” said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college board said students spend an average of more than $1,200 annually on textbooks and study materials, but that there would be different cost-cutting options for the students.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, announced that textbook rental has doubled since 2011.
Industry surveys show that about a quarter of the books were rented at college bookstores last spring semester, said Neebos vice president Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one-time thing for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books online cost only a third of the price they are available for at the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be obtained from specialist textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don’t mind the notes of other or normal traces of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors if previous spending was permissible.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar papers.
In such cases, older editions can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com by eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Renting
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and you don’t want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent “Calculus” for about $20 for the duration of a semester.
Find out about the terms of the business you are renting from, including the penalty fees that may apply for writing notes, underlining, or traces of use.
Tenants beware: If you don’t return the book, the penalty charges may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students often find the best deals in literature courses, as many classics can be downloaded for free these days, while academic and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
In any case, look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for determining the price of books, as you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before placing an online order, you should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price at the college bookstore.
Why Guardians of the Galaxy didn't win
Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables 3" grossed less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the U.S., while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" grossed just $12 million of his $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz’s “Sex Tape” grossed just $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children’s movies like “Taming Dragons Made Easy 2” also disappoint in revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in children’s films, the lack of quality in the films themselves may be the reason.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "Dragon taming made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, with films for a slightly older target group, it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer movie launch shown between Memorial Day and July 20, 2013, and on at least 2,000 screens during the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of cinemagoers and film critics and suggest that this year’s film hits are equivalent to last year’s.
Some commentators feel that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s soon-to-be-released Jungle Book film, told the Hollywood Reporter website, “I think times are changing.”
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak box office results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently achieved revenue with streaming content of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year, in which revenue was 837 million dollars.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on film adaptations of comics and predicted a "core meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his bleak prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to potential box office hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in box office results as simply “cyclical,” telling Hollywood Reporter, “Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office ever, and no one will worry about business anymore.”
A few years ago, when the 2nd table tennis district class was removed for the purpose of streamlining the league division, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into its program.
As a result, those who have not ascended have descended.
Göttingen’s top-class team Torpedo avoided relegation in the Oberliga relegation, but will only play fifth-class in the coming season.
Fourth-class torpedoes remain ladies, despite their grandiose passage into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo-Reserve compete in the new Verbandsliga, in the Landesliga no more Göttingen clubs are represented.
For the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class in terms of composition is now the new Bezirksoberliga Süd.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC will compete here.
In the Bezirksliga, Dransfeld and SC Weende play as regional representatives, in the district class of the TTC II, Rot-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen will start in the Bezirksliga.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends its girls to the small district league.
The district league relay of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the West relay are the Rot-Wei<0xC3><0x9F> II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play in the Eastern relay.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode district, where there are no more women’s teams at the district level.
Remarkably, none of the six 2nd circuit classes achieves target strength, here the innovative and busy circuit board will have to think about.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments for us over the weekend and spoke with protesters who travelled to Belgium from Bridgend.
Teenager flown out of the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage bushwalkers were brought to safety with the rope winch after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set off for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search party from local police and emergency services broke up and the couple was found near Bridal Veil Waterfalls at about 11 p.m.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and had opened his head.
Rescuers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out Monday morning.
They were taken to Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition with an ambulance.
Anti-government protests in Pakistan escalate
The approximately 1,000 protesters were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, information minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
The station resumed broadcasting after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the pole-equipped protesters had damaged editorial equipment.
No dead or injured were reported.
The protesters are demanding the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
The police said that about one kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there were again on Monday clashes of around 3000 protesters with security forces.
According to hospital information, a police officer was injured.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured over the weekend as protesters tried to advance to Sharif’s residence.
They are demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called on Sunday evening after a meeting at army headquarters for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and without using force."
“The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state.”
The escalating violence has raised concerns about military intervention, which has been more frequent in the past.
Protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have been going on since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to persevere.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri said the same thing.
Khan accuses Sharif of having won the parliamentary election in May last year by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had initially held out peacefully in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to advance to Sharif’s residence over the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after second victory of the season in third place in the table.
With the 2-0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday has come to an end for Rapid.
"The win is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate low with the Europa League exit on Thursday.
"The experience of success was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goal scorer Steffen Hofmann, who advanced to third place with Grün-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to the road Rapid has shown with the second victory of the season the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes with a sense of success into the international break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said full-back Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory in the 14th minute with his magnificent leading volley from the 16th corner.
"I thought I'd cut all the frustration from Thursday in and put it under the bar," the 26-year-old said, smiling.
When Schrammel had met for the last time in a Bundesliga match on 13 November 2010, that was still for Ried.
The first championship goal in Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the Rapid young generation," said Schrammel.
Due to the short-term pelvic injury of Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did very well there as well.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in a mirrored way.
He has earned the goal, he has already made some assists this year," praised Barisic.
Team showing character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2–0 by Hofmann after a good one hour which finally brought the decision.
Before that, the guests could have written.
"Thank God we were a bit lucky today," Schrammel remarked, alluding to the gap between performance and result in recent weeks: "The results did not vote, but the playfulness was always good compared to last year".
Barisic even said that they had been “better than today in many games before” – against “the strongest team that has played at this stadium this season”.
The first three-pointer since 26 July therefore proved that the team structure was intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team showed that it has character".
For him, it is no less gratifying: "That we have finally played to zero again."
The fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger had to complain about several failures, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made their debuts, makes the victory even more valuable.
"We must not forget this," warned Barisic, who lost in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately."
The international break must therefore be used to "lick wounds and gain a bit in the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21 selection players in his ranks.
One of the people who seems to be particularly interested in the break is Captain Hofmann.
He's tearing himself apart for the crew, going through pain over it.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us,” said Barisic.
Hofmann not only gave the game Rapids the structure before his substitution in the 68th minute, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who played his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first goal from the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We certainly had a bit of luck, but at some point the luck has to come back to us.
Now it was high time,” said Hofmann.
He warned, however, to concentrate on further work: "You can't always see that in black and white.
We haven't played as badly in the last few weeks as we've been shown.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role to the team.
It’s a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
They stick to me in certain phases,” said Hofmann.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to reproach himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter-hit "from the category Magic Gate", as well as the regular goal by Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly denied by referee Kollegger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards the goal in some phases.
We have had too few degrees.
Central defender Maximilian Karner saw it in a similar way: "It started off badly, but then we found our way in and even scored a goal.
By and large, there would have been more.
Under this tree there is peace
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series "Mein Stück vom Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the specimen shown is the "Gei<0xC3><0x9F>ruheiche" above Unterwei<0xC3><0x9F>enbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak tree.
It passes by pools, basalt stone piles and basalt stone seas.
A little bit below the quarry from Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks the natural monument, it protrudes beyond the other trees in the area and reminds with a circumference of more than eight meters of an American sequoia tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there were only indications of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and asked older people from Unterwei<0xC3><0x9F>enbrunn to find out what their relationship is with the Gei<0xC3><0x9F>ruheiche.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Until about 80 years ago, the goatherds were said to have driven their animals from Unterwei<0xC3><0x9F>enbrunn to the laboriously cleared and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree are said to have rested the animal guardians exhausted from the ascent.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because goat herds are actually grazing on the meadows again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider further found out.
However, you should be careful when entering the stone accumulations, because the basalt, warmed up by the sun, is also a popular place for cross otters.
A hiking trail leads from Unterwei<0xC3><0x9F>enbrunn to the tree, but which is somewhat hidden.
Further trails are signposted, climb the direction Hochrhön and invite you to an extended hike.
Where is the water castle?
However, a water castle, which is searched for in our next task, is rather rare to find in height.
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the district that could fit the building’s contours.
Where is our "Piece of Rhöner Happiness"?
My piece of Rhöner happiness

After weeks of tug-of-war, Italy’s Prime Minister and Acting EU President, Matteo Renzi, has won the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy against strong conservative opposition at last week’s EU special summit, she will succeed British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, as the pro-government daily La Repubblica points out, considers the appointment of his favourite Mogherini, also in the government team, to strengthen the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his “reform package” in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes that this will also calm down the left-wing party base, which is always rebelling against him, because Mogherini is assigned to it - albeit rather in a moderate way.
Against the conservative representatives with the President of the Commission Jean-Claude Juncker and the nominated Polish President Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion in Rome, thus established a political balance.
The EU’s chief diplomat will also be the deputy to Commission President Juncker.
The European Parliament’s pending approval is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an “important recognition” of Italy’s role in the EU.
La Repubblica is spreading optimism that Mogherini, who has been tried and tested in leading party offices for almost two decades and known for her ambition, will be able to cope with the "enormous challenges".
Born in Rome, she is married and has two daughters.
She began her party career in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left-Democrats), which merged with the Catholic Centre Party Margherita in 2008 to form today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became vice president of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the election in 2001 to the party council of the Left Democrats, she entered the high party politics, worked in the department of foreign policy, of which she soon became head.
It occupied traditional focuses of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies of NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the USA.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD today again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party’s over 40 percent vote in the EU elections in May, then as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The allegations in Brussels that the new EU foreign commissioner has too little diplomatic experience, i.e. that there is a lack of substance, are countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini’s mistrustfully realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being pursued and defamed as a “Russia-friendly course”.
It supports the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe, bypassing Ukraine, which also serves to secure Italy’s energy.
After Renzi took office as EU President in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos she showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with outrage, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief to a Milan economic summit in October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an apprentice who has already completed another training at the company.
The new employees will work in four training occupations: electronics technician (three apprentices), mechatronics technician (two), tool mechanic (two) and process mechanic (two).
All trainees come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new apprentices previously attended secondary schools and secondary schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all ages and the trainers go to a team-building event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees spread over all years is 27.
Socialists in France should “shut up and put France in order,” said Francois Hollande’s main ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has met with disapproval from the vast majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain by his side," he said with great applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce demands for a loosening of the rule on the part of Emmanuel Macron, the new economy ministers.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande had urged his fellow socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, threw sand into the gear, appearing at a meeting of renegade Socialist MPs and criticizing the Socialist Party for taking the French “faith in their future.”
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, derided the Socialists’ ongoing trench warfare, saying she could not imagine the new Valls government going on for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one won't survive the fall or winter either," Miss Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party’s call for a dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident of winning early elections and was ready for government.
France’s ruling party suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party faces the risk of disintegration into several rival factions before Hollande’s 2017 term ends.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment numbers.
“There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Norwegian Cruise on the verge of a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise line operator, is negotiating to acquire its rival Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion company, access to Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruise ships as well as its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end without result.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, a 13 percent increase from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals around $29 billion and is expected to grow in emerging markets such as China and India over the next few years due to the strengthening of the middle class.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise operators for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulators for an IPO in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder at the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, according to regulatory authorities, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP a share of 8 percent in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly account for 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election.
A peking-faithful group waved the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed a framework law on Sunday allowing only two or three candidates to run in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be staffed with peking loyal members.
This decision made it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote, prompting pro-democracy activists to make good on their threat and cripple the financial center of Hong Kong with “Occupy Central” protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial topic in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears that calls for democracy are spreading to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper in June outlining China’s dominance over Hong Kong, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business district and organized a sit-in.
Li’s survey is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Zhang Rongshun, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee’s Legal Commission, and Feng Wei, Vice Director of the Hong Kong and Macau State Council’s Office of Affairs, were to be interviewed during the day.
Student activists announced that they would meet in the afternoon in front of the Hong Kong leadership’s office.
Until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong, Britain did not provide for any democratic elements.
Putin calls on Kiev to start 'state talks' with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday, according to Russian media reports, that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the renegade region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that his status vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Ukraine would have to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin’s call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits in with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the start of the riots five months ago: helping the separatists capture territories and putting pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region to become de facto independent for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to retake separatist-held areas in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossia" or "New Russia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of Ukrainian politicians’ campaigns for the elections on Oct. 26, and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in separatist-held areas, hope for early peace talks are “trapped in their illusions,” Itar-Tass reported.
"We must immediately begin detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of Southeast Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been under discussion for months by the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
Peskov said this is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman’s clarification to correct the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks underscored Russia’s leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russians and polls from the pre-conflict period showed a broad majority for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects Russian territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for the majority of the Russian Navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, in his inaugural speech on 7 June, suggested that Ukrainian legislation, after new elections, should consider additions to the Constitution, which would give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose arming and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin’s last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing followed a further incursion by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoazovsk, which Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region as far as Crimea.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have begun to fortify Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean Peninsula.
Speaking at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday, Poroshenko urgently called for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are on the verge of a point where there is no turning back," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit decided on no concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council reports Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilovaisk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian Celebrities and Gabi Grecko Nude Photos Scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger over hackers who allegedly stole nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who's Who of Hollywood's A-Promis.
The movie city is in turmoil after a series of unique photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence surfaced in a hacking scandal surrounding celebrities on the Internet.
The hacker in charge probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star of "The Tributes of Panem" and of superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne have also reportedly published private photos due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who got engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was “shameful” and that those affected “felt hurt.”
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying on top without in a pool.
Palmer's films include "Love Is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were yesterday not available for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative for Lawrence’ told TMZ, “It’s a heinous invasion of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen denounced the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked pictures from a cell phone is nothing more than selling stealerware."
From a purely legal point of view, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers were present yesterday at the 8th cycling on the Gro<0xC3><0x9F>e Feldberg and supported the association "Hilfe für krebskranke Kinder" (help for children with cancer).
The tour, which was torture for some, was an easy training for others.
Everyone agreed that it was fun.
Thomas Studanski may have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberursel brewery went by bike to the Feldberg yesterday.
For a good cause.
He can easily put the little muscle soreness away, especially since the participation in the 8th cycling on the Gro<0xC3><0x9F>er Feldberg in favor of the association "Hilfe für krebskranke Kinder" (Frankfurt) has brought him personally a valuable insight.
That's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do this - great!"
Little break on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants tortured themselves yesterday in the Frühttau and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the 11 km long stretch between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Take Norman Die<0xC3><0x9F>ner, for example.
The all-red Green politician from the district council - red dress, red bike - made something understatement at the start ("Every crowd of professionals, arriving is the goal!"), but then turned out to be half professional on the mountain and went through the finish after 45 minutes without breathlessness.
He, too, rode the track in one go, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokeswoman for the city of Oberursel, who had set off together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, "Feldberg cycling" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we like to be there - we would have done a ride anyway today," says Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning, in order to get back on his feet.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung in the saddle at 9 o'clock in the morning at home, "made" the Feldberg twice, then rolled home with fun.
Fun was also had "fritten-toni".
For the head of the Oberurseler cult kiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply part of it.
He had been aiming for 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo race bike.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious road cyclist".
He has to be, because he was on the road with the "fixie wheel", which are also road bikes, but without a gear...
Not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the fox dance to the summit, but also a jogger who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a cord proved that it was easy to climb without a wheel.
Bergwacht doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with four-wheeled bully and quad, ensured safety, said: "I know him from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sledging trail, only that he pulls the sled himself."
The 718 participants - and thus more than ever before - had been sent to the track in groups in the morning.
The walkers first at 9.30 am.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 o’clock.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf den Gro<0xC3><0x9F>er Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to block the route to the Feldberg up to the safety of the participants.
