Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the eurozone is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the eurozone, the inflation rate was higher than expected in November – after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was registered, as reported by the EU’s statistical office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are expected to be as low as 3%, Bloomberg reported.
In contrast to the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the leitzsins. In its opinion, the interest rate cut would favor the rise in commodity prices and the slight fall in unemployment.
The ECB strives to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in a quandary: inflation must be “agreed” in order to rule out the need for action later on.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in November in Germany reached a twelve-year record high; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Rising food and energy prices are responsible for the rise in inflation in the eurozone.
MATIF wheat quotations rose by 88 percent, and soybean prices also hit a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in prices for cooking oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price of crude oil rose by 52 percent this year – last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation is expected to rise from 2.1 per cent in 2008 to 2.5 per cent, but it is expected to decline to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
Analysts expect a 3 percent inflation rate over the next 3-4 months, but estimate the annual average rate at 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup's Government Crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of Fidesz supporters has grown considerably until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while approval for the socialists, according to Gallup, has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent.
In the case of party- loyal voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: More than two thirds (71 percent) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) of the support for the MSZP.
According to the survey, the MDF and the SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry barrier: they come to two percent of the total population.
The number of party voters in both camps has grown by one percent.
Compared to the last low, general economic sentiment has continued to deteriorate – never before has the proportion of those who rate the country’s economic situation as “extremely bad” been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it “pretty bad”.
After more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation once again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth of them expect an improvement.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents – a historic high – rated the Prime Minister’s work as “rather bad than right.”
Thirteen percent of the respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny in general, while the proportion of supporters for Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n accounts for 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of the party leader of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of people who think that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be managed without a change of government.
After the riots last October, 35% had voted in favour of the government and the head of government remaining, but today this share amounts to only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent responded that they “participate with certainty” and another 20 percent would “probably” cast their vote.
By comparison, if the parliamentary elections were held this Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the polls "with certainty", another 15 percent consider their participation to be "probable". Given these trends, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital daily allowance.
In turn, the proportions of opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would be as high as 81, 84 and 89 percent, respectively.
Auchan most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trading area have also this year maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that this year there was no increase in VAT.
Articles by Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g
In the Budaörs trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of over 1,000 HUF were registered in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets “galopated” last December, the rate of inflation has not been drastic compared to the already high, earlier level.
However, it is certainly dissuasive to consumers that what they had paid for last year far below HUF 9,000 is not even available this year for HUF 10,000.
The price of the "Napi" basket exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets studied.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800, the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year’s level, while the prices for turkey breast fillets, nut and poppy seeds rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of bread rolls for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price drop below 200 forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two liter Coca-Cola deposit bottle of under 200 forints, so the drink including deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison Auchan scored the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart compared to the Christmas prices last year by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan have each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between last year’s cheapest shopping basket and this year’s most expensive was 12%, while the increase between last year’s cheapest shopping basket and this year’s most expensive one was 21%.
The average price increase was 1,480.00 HUF.
The average price increase was still 1,206.00 forints in the previous year, but the VAT increase was noticeable in the prices at last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has hit the trade badly: apparently the department stores could not really decide which price range to apply to the individual articles, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behavior were unpredictable.
(If the trader is planning a product’s circulation speed poorly, he may drop by substantial profits in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price of the "Napi" basket last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forints, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630.00 forints more than last year, and even the cheapest one saw a price increase of 1,284.00 forints.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, the price of daily consumables in the hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office found a more than 30% increase in the price over the 12-month period.
So in addition to flour, also with eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price level of the product, which was already expensive in the previous year, has risen by barely more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Obviously flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they were able to pass the drastic price increase on to the multinationals.
In the golden trade triangle, hypermarkets do not complain; good years are constantly being reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer even look at the prices.
Large quantities are purchased from everything, durable food goes over the counter in pallets.
Wednesday morning there were endless queues at the cash desk in all three department stores when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country is reported to have a lower customer frequency, so many multinationals complain to the pollsters that they could not even reach the planned turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overload of the staff - all factors that are not exactly conducive to the containment of infections, according to the lead doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of the J<0xC3><0xA1>nos hospital, an MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection.
The victim of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly afterwards the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation has not yet been performed because of the bacterium that is still in the patient’s body.
By December 10 of this year, 1094 infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens had been reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System from hospitals, according to the lead physician of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about one-third of people in its nose without it causing disease.
SA-related infections (such as strep throat, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the agents are over-dosed or used improperly, the well-responsive bacteria develop into antibiotic-resistant bacteria that quickly spread under appropriate conditions in hospitals.
Especially in patients with weakened or permanently malfunctioning immune systems, but also in older patients or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the J<0xC3><0xA1>nos hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of everyday life in the hospital.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi warned - MRSA just does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff wear rubber gloves and masks during the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment," says Tibor Nyulasi.
When they are admitted to the hospital, patients are examined for MRSA, but an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rarely
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be preventable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for curbing the emergence or spread of the multidrug-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection is predominantly found in hospitals and retirement homes, hospitals should examine the admitted patients and immediately isolate MRSA-infected patients.
However, microbiological sampling is not so common in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no grants from the state health insurance for this investigation.
Most cases would therefore only come to light if the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, that is, microbiological examinations are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive is not always complied with by hospitals.
Among the outpatient or primary care patients, microbiological sampling is even rarer, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Savings are made with disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another by caregivers.
This is precisely why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in this area in the hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in domestic hospitals there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patient.
In fact, the rooms are often overcrowded, the beds are just next to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, in the less financially well-off hospitals, it even happens that there are savings in disinfectants, there are few carers, many patients - all factors that almost favor the development of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped, where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes enormous costs to health insurance companies, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government program.
After initial indications, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has made prevention of the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
The police officer was not drunk.
In the case of the car accident with a fatal outcome caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official report is now available.
The now-retired police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither drunk nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman for the Budapest Chief Prosecutor’s Office on Friday, after the official opinion on the case was presented.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he sat down at the wheel.
The former police chief turned into Kossuth Lajos Street with his own car in the XXII district and ran over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked location.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebars, even if pedestrians do not cross the street at the crosswalk, subordinate .)
The pedestrian succumbed to his injuries after being admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then resigned and asked for retirement.
The Budapest prosecutor’s office has opened its investigation into the incident.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka signed three loan agreements in Budapest on Friday, with a total value of EUR 400 million to be invested in education, transport and environmental infrastructure and the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) has approved in 2006 a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The 100 million loan agreement has already been signed earlier, the current agreement deals with the use of the EUR 200 million awarded.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also to be spent on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million to Hungary for this purpose; the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later as part of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed a EUR 50 million agreement, which will be mainly used in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the subway line 4 was also discussed.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of metro financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest is EURIBOR-linked, the loan is provided commission-free by the EIB with a deferral of 8 years.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe is paying attention to the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys in the still cheapest market of the EU, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is without a doubt the most sought-after pavement for property purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Among the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea Albena, the "gold coast", the "sun coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nesebar the Renner, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior will also attract investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the very favorable area of Ruse has more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office space offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive European golfers’ paradises, and thus attracting tourists in addition to the summer and winter seasons as well as in the other two seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying in a big way, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also striving to change their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down either buy revitalized properties for 50-100,000 euros, or rundown houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are important, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are decisive for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group is made up of business people who invest with the aim of increasing value in the medium to long term.
However, real estate in the capital is constantly becoming more expensive, due to the constantly growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been an annual increase of 21 percent.
The price increase in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As Environment Minister G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will come to an end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a heated debate between developed and developing countries.
The U.S. has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate on concrete figures, but would be willing to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
The other big question of the conference is whether the developed countries are willing to support the developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on support for developing countries has also been reached.
The Adaptation Fund, which is subordinated to the Kyoto Protocol, is to be managed by a 16-member Council, presumably at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as stated in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's 6%
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured against 1990 levels), whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" is achieved successfully, and the Union would even be willing to push for a 30% reduction if other major industrialised countries of the world, or developing countries, are also willing to meet their commitments to the best of their ability and responsibly.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor stressed that the objective of the states that had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU, with its then 15 member states, had already committed to a reduction of 8%.
The target for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1985-87 - a target that the country will certainly meet, as can be read in the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
The commitment is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be ready within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction project defined in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed by a new, international emission reduction system, the importance of which the IPCC, the international scientific climate change committee awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, has also highlighted in its latest report.
This would delay emission reduction, and increase the Earth’s average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, leading to extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
British army advertises on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos about operations conducted against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reports.
The images, shot with miniature cameras mounted on helmets, are checked at the Kandahar Air Force Base and then sent to London, where they are posted on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but the British Foreign Office (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peacekeeping Forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq also have their own YouTube channels.
Operation ''Afghanistan'''
Originally, the Air Force released the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual goals of the foreign missions.
Propaganda of this kind is almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertising, according to defence expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans Advertise with Game
But the army must also fight against amateur shots, which, in addition to the carefully edited, censored shots, also make it into the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are talked about at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Incidentally, from the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos filmed in action have already been uploaded to the platform, but this "genus" has only recently been discovered by the British.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "Americas Army", in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier as part of a more or less life-like simulation.
Christmas Party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministries
Minister of Labour M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth is by no means squeamish: instead of a Christmas party, she organizes a working conference at which her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and potash.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure Christmas mood with raffle or toast to the official hearts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - that's how the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already captured the offices.
The largest Christmas party of a ministry is held this year in the defense department, but the employees of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of the orphans" children are gifted by fallen soldiers, at the "mission celebration" family members of soldiers currently stationed abroad are hosted, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department will provide around 25 million euros for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFD) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport beat the strings.
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a raffle.
The National Agency for Development (NfU) held its 4.7 million-forint Christmas party on Wednesday at the House of the State Judicial Council (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The hall rent was 1 million forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NF<0xC3><0x9C> is also invited to another Christmas party organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("V<0xC3><0xAD>gsz<0xC3><0xAD>nh<0xC3><0xA1>z") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information, as we have not reached the responsible persons.
Why the suit?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NF<0xC3><0x9C>, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 people attended the ball.
The festivities were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] it was announced: There was no ball dress or dress obligation at the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour, and Self-Government are each preparing for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in their own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Minister of Labour M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to the conference to end the year.
It is expected that about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are only served with coffee and potash, so the celebration runs out with 350,000 forints.
Self-government minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply toast in the auditorium of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas party in its own banquet hall, at which 436 employees are expected.
Spending was measured at 2,500 forints per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception followed by toasting.
Since the beginning of the term of office of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate every year in this way.
However, there will be no real party mood - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year's reception on January 20th, the Christmas party of the Ministry is cancelled this time.
The one hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("V<0xC3><0xA1>rosliget"); according to the resort, the expenses are calculated at 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple standing reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally start with a short speech by the minister and end with restrained feasting.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas party at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or at the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the cost of the Christmas party, the press department of the Ministry of the Environment could not provide any information.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is held at the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their coordination committee on Friday for the strike of an indefinite duration starting on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest meeting will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the work stoppage begins.
It is expected that there will be significant traffic disruptions due to the strike, since rail traffic will be almost completely stopped, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) will also strike until 1 p.m.
Details on Monday’s strike will be shared by the League of Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be set up, which will be responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A large-scale protest meeting will be held on Saturday, and from Monday onwards all organisations that have joined the strike will cease work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike that began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the health insurance law, the unions immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committee will meet to discuss the next steps.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that a vote on the health insurance law will only take place in the late evening hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes, which begin on Monday, will result in significant traffic disruptions: railway workers will be laid off indefinitely, most of the public transport and more than half of the Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n companies will be shut down in the morning.
At the same time, there will be motorway closures of one direction in many places.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations announced strikes indefinitely, others are planning a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian Railways M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Trade Union of Railways VDSZSZ on sufficient services, although especially around the Christmas holidays more and more people are traveling by train.
According to previous reports, the BKV will strike from the start of operations until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the LIGA unions for electricity and heat energy will stop working for four hours, and the teachers' union, for example the Democratic Teachers' Union, have called for 2 or 2-8 hour strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes alternatingly across the country at various times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraw the draft health insurance reform and submit a new conception for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
The third requirement is that eligible professional groups have access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer made by the Ministry of Transport concerning the secondary lines and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to Political Capital’s Risk Analysing Division, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was founded this August with the support of the “Movement for a Better Hungary”, have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, among other things, that, in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "intensification of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsies and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic clashes in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at the provocation of such a dispute, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "Persons of public life have left the discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical political groups, who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary opposition."
It is thought that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favor extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention paid to them by the domestic and foreign media, “have seriously damaged Hungary’s image abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity.”
We remember that since the autumn of 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been continuously on the upswing, so that since the summer of 2007, several organizations called "national self-defense associations" have been founded.
“These groups have in common that they each define themselves as a civilian organization, while openly bragging about preparing their members for – sometimes armed – defence tasks (catastrophe protection, national defence, law enforcement), citing the incompetence of the police, the army, or the state itself,” it said.
And again: all this is done according to the method that tries to disguise various political aspirations as a bourgeois initiative based on the political and party disillusionment of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association therefore serve not only to circumvent legal hurdles that could arise in the course of registration in court - it is also a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring states, according to some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard sees the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region," it said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-Eastern Europe, so the political risk has grown for the entire region.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass riots that took place in a neighborhood of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents as an opportunity to establish the National Guard, arguing that the goal of the organization is "national protection".
According to her, there has been a real "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria over the past 17 years, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, according to Political Capital.
The initiative would have sparked a fierce debate among the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to establish their own guard for resistance purposes.
As the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protection, according to the risk warning report by Political Capital.
Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, research director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news bureau: “Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annually, risk analysis reports would be published, and should risk-altering trends be discernible, public opinion will be informed, as in the case by issuing the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are regulated exactly by law, so the practice of re-disposing the working days around the holidays has now established itself, but the coming year will give us fewer such days.
Also in the EU and in America one understands something else by "holidays".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and non-working days.
Non-working days are mostly church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the latter just so that the New Year celebrations can rest.
In the whole year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The national holidays are the 15th of March, which commemorates the Revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, the anniversary of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, the founding of the state, on May 1 the work is celebrated, on November 1 and 2 we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national, or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of “workday shift” has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we work very well on the Saturdays before, or have to go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be worked out, has for many years been determined by the Minister of Labour in a separate regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and recipients, public employees and civil servants alike.
Only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on public holidays, are excluded.
This year, the work order is only confused by the holidays at the end of the year: From December 24th, life in this country will officially stand still, since most take time off for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or take the specially cancelled vacation.
Next year, more holidays fall in the middle of the week, or the end of the week, so that there will be fewer re-dispositions in the working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday April 26th will be a working day so that Friday May 2nd can be a day of rest.
The second re-disposition is related to the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, you will have to finish the Friday, 24 October in advance.
The end of the year, however, will be completely marked by the holidays, after everything will stop from December 24, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six Dissuasive Little Things to Annoy Workmates
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: They bring "color" into everyday life in the workplace.
The only question is whether to get used to these small inconveniences, or to better face the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstood, for other annoying situations consciously.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called" - says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it by perhaps calling the marketing department and confessing repentantly that you forgot to line the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the case is dismissed with an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should think about how you can give your colleagues really unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Borrow something that doesn’t belong to you?
There’s hardly anything more annoying than reaching for a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague’s desk?
Without questions, one should not borrow anything from colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find that something has gone away.
So, don't put envelopes or post-it from the office in your pocket, because it could hit you: no more if you really need it.
Talk about the private lives of your colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who did what with whom?
Where and why?
One should not tie the information (or assumptions) about the private lives of colleagues to everyone's nose if possible!
And if someone opens up and reveals his innermost secret to us, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave, instead of aligning those who are not present at the moment, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick for no reason?
When you call the office to report sick, citing excruciating headaches, because you are feeling uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, undeliverable tasks, projects with fixed deadlines must now be done by your colleagues instead of yourself.
Don’t play bad with your colleagues.
If you already know the day before that you will not make it to the office the next day, or that something could interfere, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time, so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Call me, call me, call me
One is just deepened in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud giggles of the colleagues?
Unintentionally listening to a phone call that you shouldn’t have heard?
One should not annoy colleagues with humming, singing, loud conversations (which one carries over their heads), trampling, constant scolding or nagging.
All of this can be very disruptive, even if they are not particularly engrossed in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not completed on time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not seek the guilt of your own forgetfulness from others!
If possible, you should not talk yourself out of the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others have been affected.
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or make up for the missed one, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training pants and slacks: Comfortable for at home, but has not lost anything in the office!
Not even then should you dress so casually, if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress appropriately in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Want to make it right for everyone - or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of every morning traffic jams.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume up.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar that sounds on mr2.
For a long time, the local music scene did not spoil us with qualitative electropop.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you listen to the new album by Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting production from the domestic digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even when the garage rock with its guitar quirks is "in" again, the domestic electropop proves: there is something new under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger started in Pécs, made his own music in the band Yonderboi, before - perhaps because an inn does not tolerate two pipers - he started his own way.
His breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which merges elements of jazz, electronic, and pop, was only achieved when he was approached with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, only became known to the wider public when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and, together with Yonderboi, named Zagar the almost only trendsetter, also marketable in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they would like to wear this brand.
The band has responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The now released new album entitled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new paths for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger was on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be fine, but besides the ethereal character of the music, the - according to the zeitgeist and the trends - louder guitar, the influences of rock'n'roll stand out.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere at Millen<0xC3><0xA1>ris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio hit - the new Mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, who broadcasts pop music from early to late, has successively put the ear to the listener with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
All right, then (?).
The hvg.hu asked Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The term "layered music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two casts in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, just as they can only be produced for sale, which makes them commercial music.
Even a good pop number can arise from an honest motive.
The listener’s willingness to take in also works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentively because they also consider them to be a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
We have never written for the market.
For us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is mostly felt in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but that in turn only exists in the intangible changes of the moment.
However, I noticed one thing: If you want to please everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the road as a soloist and has built his career rather in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go his way, let alone trying to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves rather as team players who trust in the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
In the beginning, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which should then serve as a driving force for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting together the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene.
This is how the six-piece choir - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - was created, which we later christened "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song the same way, or did the girls help shape it?
B. Zs.: The song had been around in the instrumental version for some time, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that this song still "needs something".
The sequence of chords has literally demanded a singing voice.
I sang the melody in the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came practically at once and frighteningly spontaneous.
I remember, I was quite electrified at the time, but it also needed the "divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, one had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short solo by Judy Jay), they have no role of their own, sing together completely and are no louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also in the back of the stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: That they were standing in the back was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting one’s ego a little bit, forgetting who has come from where and where, we simply allow these particular wings, the wings of love to lift us up.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song came into being.
hvg.hu: Which was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical creative work actually none at all, there have been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, with "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or with "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't want to work for a long time, but gradually everything came together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song from the new album?
B. Zs.: That changes constantly with the concerts and also now that I have released the album.
Currently they are "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the song "Never The Same".
Fraudulent broker risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Bottomless Fraudster
For example, his former employee Jerome Kerviel refers to the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> banka.
Because of him, it came in at almost five billion euros.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do it to his colleagues, was certainly not incapable.
In contrast to all the big banks, he recognized in time the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He is mentally weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who reported him to the police.
But as Kerviel’s statements, published by the French media, such as the daily Le Monde, show, he was a man who had made profits of 1.6 billion euros with his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was for my bank to make money," he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he had managed to earn half a billion euros precisely on the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was already initial news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had payment problems before, would get into trouble.
But this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn’t believe it and was right.
By the end of the year, he had increased his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
“Even when I made the first half-billion, I didn’t know how to explain it,” Kerviel admits and goes on to say that he definitely didn’t keep anything to himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he falsified documents so that he would not be found out.
He even managed to deceive his bosses, even though the Eurex exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk Profits
Was he afraid of flying?
I don't think so.
"I thought it satisfied the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
He knew he would never earn as much as anyone else.
“From my first conversation in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told the investigators.
But soon after his entry came the first great success.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by betting half a billion euros on price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he said to the policeman.
But the bosses supposedly knew about everything, or suspected it.
"As long as I made money, you closed your eyes."
But then came the big blow at the beginning of this year.
In a single day, he lost one billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they get on with him?
Suspiciously, he went on a vacation.
"I only took four days from last year.
A realtor who doesn’t take a vacation is one who doesn’t want you to look into his cards,” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes, which will enable the Czech Republic to reach 14 billion euros (about 365 billion kroner) over the next few years.
This amounts to about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion kroner comes from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion kroner from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will go into traffic expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and includes up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money will increase according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will dispose of 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme is designed to help entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative ventures.
The companies are to gain finance for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful among the new candidate countries to date in terms of money acquisition from EU funds.
Nicaraguan court upholds 20-year prison sentence for ex-president
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, whom he had been sentenced to in 2003 for financial fraud in the amount of 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion kroner).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state comes back behind bars, according to the news agency AP is currently unclear.
According to the chairman of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the prison officials whether to let Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n serve his sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
Four years ago, a court found that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n had regularly transferred money from the government to accounts held by foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually ended up in a fund that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n had set up to fund his 2001 election campaign.
Budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has drafted, and which has been adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year was still approved with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented it, and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not therefore afford to reject it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no confidence against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives calmly approved this traditionally little-regarded, yet highly significant law.
This is, in a sense, paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the household, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is obscured by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
The state budgets of the past Social Democratic governments have suffered from three weaknesses that the budget for 2008 cannot eliminate all at once:
The first is the high share of expenditures that are legally obligatory, not only pensions, but also social expenditures, which the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is deficit fiscal policy as a result of the first weak point.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in order to tap other sources of investment besides revenues from taxes, levies, and bank loans, often issued reckless bonds, through which they overindebted their town halls.
In recent years, they managed to pay off these debts by mass selling off shares of the energy and other utility networks they had received from the state in the process of privatization.
Now that source is gone.
As far as we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a period of growth for several years now, which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD has been constantly boasting about.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have operated much more sensibly than our Republic.
This is a huge shame, which is mainly due to the previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are the least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which have unfortunately been inflated to a gigantic extent in the last few years.
Although it has succeeded in eliminating some of the nonsensical populist spending that was passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no change in the retirement age and pension reform in the near future, virtually all politics in this country will end, and, no matter who is in power, nothing will remain for him but pure management.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that then ruling politicians become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social spending.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion kroner planned for 2008 would be quite superfluous if previous governments had not spent in the last ten years, which was only possible.
If we do not want it to really happen that ruling politicians become pure administrators, then we must be patient and this not-too-strong coalition government, which is aware, however, that the state can only spend as much as it is able to in taxes and fees to take, rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these enable a gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
For example, more than $100 billion will reach the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, the banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the U.S. Fed sends $40 billion at auction, while another 24 make it easy for the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time, after the attacks of 11 September, that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to ward off or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties facing the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend," wrote in a report for his clients Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
“Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. from 65% to about 50%,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unserved loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses of billions.
“The central banks must have been really afraid of what could still be done when they decided to do so,” Kieran Davies, ABN Amro’s chief economist, said in a statement.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
That would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession, possibly affecting economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to do so after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used to lend money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and the UK had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
“This will have the same effect as further lowering interest rates,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks is helping to heat up the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Debates of ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to be the most damaging to developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the end of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not a green planet", he stated that the debates of ecologists are unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a strange mixture of government representatives and those of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word-firework that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
At the presentation of his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject matter was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often encounter caricatures of my views."
So now interested parties could read his attitude undistorted.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
After all, he is an academic, capable of understanding and assessing technical papers, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
The book’s main message was that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and thus pose no threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, he sees this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
Responding to questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who take no account of the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already spoken about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 People Failed to Exchange Their Driver's License
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver’s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where you can apply for the exchange, so that the authorities manage to issue a new driver’s license by the end of the year.
However, the ministry does not fear that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid driving licence will enter the roads after the New Year.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive anymore have not exchanged their driving license.
While small towns report a sharp decline in interest in driving licence exchanges, the capital’s offices are being flooded with applications, and interest in exchanges grew this week.
The city administration handles around 2,000 customers every day.
You have to wait about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licenses.
The issuance of a new driving license takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who fail to make the required exchange by the end of the year and leave without a valid driver’s license will face a fine from January.
The offender pays a maximum of 2000 kroner.
However, the police can also use it with a warning in case of a violation.
In the event of a violation, the penalty may rise to 2,500 crowns.
According to previous information, even those who do not drive can be punished by the municipality.
He could face, it was said, a penalty of as much as 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called on the offices to exercise leniency and to impose a penalty of not more than 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a thousand crowns.
A driver’s license is a document in which everyone can decide whether he wants to own it or not.
It is not a question of an identity card that everyone, and indeed a valid one, must have.
People who don’t want to drive anymore should give up their driver’s license.
It is enough to take him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by registered letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 become invalid.
However, drivers must also gradually exchange other types of driver’s licenses.
People with driver’s licenses from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued from 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional driving licenses.
Court lowers penalties for detectives who were allied with Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are accused of having made common cause with the gang of David Berdych, received 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively.
This was decided in a final ruling by the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced their sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no appeal against today’s ruling, only a review at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also charged in this matter, but first the first-instance judgment is before him.
In other trials, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
No more can he be condemned.
A district court in January convicted 19 people mainly for involvement in robberies, the Higher Regional Court today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most defendants denied the charges from the outset on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police in consultation with Berdych criminals handed over information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang to escape prosecution.
The gang gave Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k 30 percent of the loot.
The charges relate to crimes committed by the gang from 1999 to 2001.
Especially about robberies, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also about official presumption and illicit possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel core, a laser riflescope and a submachine gun.
According to the indictment, the gang has enriched itself by their robberies by many millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts recognized Berdych and a number of others as guilty of further robberies.
Other men from Berdych's circle have to answer in another trial, other cases have not yet gone to court.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in Irish custody and awaiting the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic, have so far escaped the main trial.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity hospital, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> 12 million kroner compensation plus court costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for each of the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each couple of parents.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l, therefore completely disagrees with Veleba’s proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today's hearing.
"But in order to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the expert opinion that the other side has drawn up.
We will determine whether it has any significance at all.
However, we insist that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for all together," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l stressed.
According to him, the amount should range between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov wanted a million crowns for every month that they had not raised their biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an expert opinion that had been drawn up for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
According to psychology and psychiatry experts, the children’s parents suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in varying degrees of strength and depth.
The men endured the stress situation better, even though they faced accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, on the other hand, cope worse with the after-effects of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is happening right now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the maternity hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>ks in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanov<0xC3><0xA1> to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the district governor of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina (Bohemian-Moravian Heights) gave each family 100,000 crowns as a substitute for expenses incurred by them as a result of the failure of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>, which is under the district's control.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by law.
In case of doubt, they must resort to a reserve fund, only in exceptional cases can they apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far awarded comparatively low sums of damages to those concerned, the amounts were determined by tables and ranged in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka came to his kingdom Wallachia
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the dispute over the brand "Kingdom of Wallachia".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Wallachian King", but the project had built up a team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> in cooperation with the actor in many years of work.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka did not participate in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's parasitic," said after the trial Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer.
Everyone introduced themselves to the words "Wallachian Kingdom" just this actor and comedian.
The same view is held by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We have almost 10 years of work behind us.
Fundraising and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause is a dispute over money.
"After years, they have noticed that the project is successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to win parasitic in our work," he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka used the term "Wallachian king" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993, the actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> crowned him.
However, this was not at that time connected with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
From an originally fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized, to which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then joined the foundation of the company "Wallachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the mere idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka had made public in the show "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka certainly helped the project of the Wallachian kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, who had dedicated themselves intensively to him.
The co-operation of the parties that are divided today lasted until the year 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized the official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, disputes between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> began to accumulate, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected until St. Never's Day".
At the suggestion of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> took on the leading role as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court dismissed today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> prepared competition for the throne and a half princess.
From this a new king was to emerge.
He did not want to reveal details and an appointment.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It was supposed to be something like the royal procession in Wallachia.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can also sign up," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advantages dwindle
To tell you the truth, I have never been a fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear shift, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The station wagon with the designation SW is still a bit further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the too little headroom in the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Continue quickly
I go through the interior only briefly, so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a rather successful design, where I only have objections because of the poor middle tunnel.
I would welcome a bit more design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past the times when we might complain about too short seats or headrests.
The side support has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As far as the space is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In the station wagon, the aforementioned lack of headroom is also eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the cargo space.
I have to call it (also because of the foldable rear window) very well loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with retaining straps, which represent an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, can be pulled apart and also hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the loading volume.
According to the table, it is 428 liters in the basic equipment, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav product, we find that the Peugeot is left behind by a clearly noticeable 52 litres.
For a holiday abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positives, I have to mention the flat cargo space after the rear seats have been folded over or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 liters and an output of 88 kWp.
And honestly, that’s what a 1600 cubic engine should look like, powering a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him to his counterpart at <0xC5><0xA0>koda, which sometimes looks like his exhaust is clogged with a rag, then I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
But we have to remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine in the amount of 329900 crowns is still going up.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is quite a lot.
The equipment premium of the test car is even more impressive with 80,000 crowns.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper release, electric windows rear and and...
The car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That is a lot, but add up the extra equipment of a Fabia and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So all that remains is to decide which brand to choose.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is not successful
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, causing fears among locals about the further development of the local school system.
So far, the integration of Eastern Europeans has encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools are even finding cases where disputes between the immigrants and the children of the original residents are increasing in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is aptly illustrated by the case of North Kent, where disputes between locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment and robberies among students have spread to relationships between parents.
The situation has already developed to such an extent that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron bar.
The accused defended himself by saying that the boy had insulted her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene after an attack by two minor girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and pelted him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bushling and spat on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his buttocks," a mother of Slovak students described another unpleasant incident to The Times.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above cases testify that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming more and more tense.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks are registered to come here for work.
Around 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will be fulfilled if you choose only the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palm trees and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and beguiling cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this to an excessive extent.
But there is much more to be found on one island, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a storehouse or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the leaders of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the US (especially during the Prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were a.o.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise buildings grew in Havana, cars drove over the wide boulevards, which were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar in the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails according to your wishes.
And the cult cars of the fifties are still driving around in Havana today, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
Havana, especially its oldest part, may be very run down, nowhere can you find so many wonderful colonial sights in the vicinity as here.
Other places are currently being cleaned out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much-needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a marotte that is unique in the world and above all attracts railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-driven narrow-gauge railways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see cute and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have been in the museum elsewhere for a long time.
Excursion destinations
The most important places do not leave out the majority of visitors to Cuba.
So you no longer have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
It is worth noting that there is a museum in the aforementioned Hemingway estate, which should not be missed by anyone who likes this writer.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities fertile soil accumulated, through which even weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet it if you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Fame and wealth brought her the trade of slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the pretty beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road there in the fifties of the last century that would have connected the area to the rest of the country.
This isolation helped it go unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, then it is worth to look at interesting places in the area, such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n beach or the "Valley of sugar factories".
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which revives after dark, and where the music does not remain silent until morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads, which lead from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo, have to overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was included by UNESCO in its World Heritage List thanks to its untouched nature.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church you can see the Columbus cross (in fact it was made about a hundred years after Columbus’s voyages), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, several table mountains can be seen, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves profess, you could write many pages about all this.
As they say, it’s better to see with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influence the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, in the words of Defense Secretary Robert Gates, draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going according to their ideas, the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed on this in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called on NATO units to be more active, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"A forward development is noticeable in Afghanistan, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to allow residents to begin to develop the economy and security themselves," British Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years, according to the American army.
The number of violent acts has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, and even by sixty percent in the southern province of Helmand.
The NATO countries have deployed about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit when it comes to the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next period and the way we can achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop said the same.
"I am not pleased with what we have available on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," De Hoop told Reuters at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been a dispute among the countries involved as to whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
However, they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called the German soldiers lazy this week.
"Afghan non-stars exposed: The Germans are making games while our boys are fighting," wrote the "Sun" in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild newspaper counterattacked and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Public debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a national debt of 84,000 kroner.
Total debt increased to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to indebted itself to 159.2 billion cones this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion, thanks to the better development of the state budget policy.
The government debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they rose by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its information on the government debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has a debt of 84,000 kroner.
Over the entire past year, the state was indebted by more than 111 billion kroner.
“Until now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the limit of one trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion kroner," David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, told iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, said: “To exceed one trillion we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly depends on the next budget, which we do not know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I do not expect such a change," he remarked.
Debts are growing
The national debt comes from the debts of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The government debt is financed by treasury bonds, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, bonds issued by the European Investment Bank.
The domestic national debt has now risen to 719.4 billion kroner this year.
The foreign debt of the state has now increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
“Over the year, total debt increased by 13 percent from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting to note that the growth is mainly in the debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that you can do something even before the pension reform comes,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and management of the government debt for 2007 show that the government had planned for this year to take in 159.2 billion kroner.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the better development of the state budget policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which will apparently reach 76 billion kroner this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
In addition, the maximum budget allocated to the Consolidation Agency is 13.3 billion kroner, a ten-billion reserve to pay pensions, the financing of government bonds worth 43 billion kroner, and the borrowing rates at the European Investment Bank amounting to 1.8 billion kroner.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been charged with insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced to 15 days in prison and subsequently deported by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening.
The British woman has been accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to give the name Mahomet to a teddy bear, although any depiction of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be whipped.
After parents of students had complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Education several times, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher, who worked at Unity High School in Khartoum, was picked up at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to pick a name for the class teddy bear.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports headmaster Robert Boules.
After all, when the class votes, 20 of 23 children choose Muhammad as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common name in Sudan.
Afterwards, the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed .
The bear itself did not bear a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the portrayal of the Islamic prophet is seen as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues at Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, stated that he knew her well, and she never would have done anything that would have brought her too close to a religious belief, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion this is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by numerous students of the teacher, who describe them as very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in class.
Keep in mind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common given name in the UK, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of reverence to the Prophet (saas) (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
At the last negotiating meeting in Vienna on Wednesday, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion session Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversies over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not come to an agreement on the status, said the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner called on Belgrade and Pristina to meet their commitments to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, indicating that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, which is 90% inhabited by Albanian speakers, could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The Baden talks, near Vienna, were the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika received a mandate from the UN last August for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their placement order to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked the approval of Kosovo’s independence at the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that end date.
Russia has been and will remain an advocate for a negotiated solution, an amicable one, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under the administration of the UN for eight years, the Western countries consider independence under the supervision of the EU to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to announce these unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Regrettably, no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where since Monday these negotiations were held the last chance.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
He added, however, that Belgrade’s proposed plan for autonomy was part of a past that led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, was of the opinion that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade says it is particularly concerned about a “domino effect” in a region that has been weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally holds a right of veto.
Kosovo's parliament will have the final say
Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.
To journalists, Fatmir Sejdiu replied that Kosovo’s parliament would have the last word on status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population would be in coordination with Western countries.
Bush calls for an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which gathered in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday under his leadership, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything in his power to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must cease its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the Roadmap for Peace, which they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately seek a peace treaty aimed at clarifying all outstanding issues without exception, including key issues.
This designation includes the three major problems around which the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians mainly revolve: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland, which is now the State of Israel, in the course of the 1948 conflict.
After the American president, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the upcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a settlement for all points, listing, among other things, Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert, for his part, took the floor, he pledged that the upcoming armistice negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would make every effort to ensure that they could be terminated before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, co-existing, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it received assurances in this sense from Bush before it decided to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has initiated a plan adopted by all Arab countries to offer peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi prince says in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily newspaper.
According to the prosecutor, the police officers are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors face each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car drove on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on patrol, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, a spokesman for the police explains.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without registration, so not released for public road traffic (see below), was driven by two young people without a helmet, approached at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it had disregarded its right-hand drive, a police officer said.
The alcohol control carried out on the vehicle passengers is much negative.
The condition of the car (bumped fender, split windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of the involuntary killing of persons and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the head of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excludes the responsibility of the police at this stage in the investigation of the IGPN.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police officers, namely that this small motorcycle came relatively quickly to their left side.
Yesterday, a kind of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footpegs on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained hooked until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be the subject of a technical review.
The bodies of the two victims were found yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly spread in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the policemen had left the scene of the accident very quickly, and this without providing help to the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious errors in this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, for which further investigations are necessary and which must be handled very carefully.
Libération met an eyewitness of those few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed police officer who was limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth on the phone.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the incident and, it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still, according to this testimony, the rescuers arrived about twenty minutes after the policemen left.
They also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be said that the police forces did not help the young people.
First aid was given to these young people.
The fire department came immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, for her part, stressed the prosecutor.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police crushed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken under the state of emergency had been injured by the tear gas grenades used by the law enforcement forces there.
They then threw stones at the policemen with which they injured them.
At least 350 lawyers have been arrested.
Similar scenarios occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition figures, human rights advocates and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations were held in Multan (middle) and Peshawar (northeast).
The lawyers’ movement received support on Monday from the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the population to send flowers to the judges who opposed the state of emergency, and to those who took an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday night.
In the days that followed, he had to take a stand on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election in a direct ballot on October 6.
The chairman of the court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed and replaced.
Everything we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate told The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise to give the supreme command of the army and become a civilian president no longer applies since the invocation of the state of emergency, said Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to surrender his military uniform by November 15, the date his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors that President Musharraf would have been assigned a residence by his deputy commander.
More than a third of pregnancies are not planned.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, according to a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, however, the liberalization of contraception has enabled better control of fertility.
Today, eight out of ten births are carefully planned.
In one in five couples, even calculated precisely on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have spent more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools crafted by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that is soon to host European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5-ton module for generating electricity via solar panels, which was already on the ISS, in order to bring it to its final position.
After moving it, the crew set out to restructure the solar panels of the module, the wingspan of which is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be folded up like accordions, was damaged by a pinched cable over a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector even more.
The astronauts, who originally left the space shuttle Discovery for a check-up and then were to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-meter remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skilful, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was thus selected to operate on the injured solar collector.
After carefully inspecting the damage, he severed the faulty cable and attached a type of rail to the damaged site.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker who stayed near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick, wrapped in insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar panels generating several hundred volts, had been devised and tinkered with by the astronauts aboard the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully unfolded before counting down his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery today to expect Wednesday’s return flight to Earth.
The title EADS on the stock exchange sanctioned
After the group Aviation and Defense announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counteract the arrears of the A400M, the stock EADS currently shows a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS is currently losing 4% to EUR 21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to re-examine its business forecasts for 2007 with reference to the backlogs caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delayed the aircraft’s maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further detail.
The Group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS’s business performance has fallen from 86% in 2006, largely due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, that of the very large A380 carrier aircraft.
Originally, the group had planned an initial delivery of the A400M to the French Army for October 2009.
Choosing the status quo
On Sunday, the counting of the ballots will not be exciting: The mass of Russians will choose President Putin’s party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, it confirms its quest for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to voters on public television, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the leading candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, when the president received the foreign ambassadors, he did not reveal anything and was content to provide a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference, his favorite topic during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have lost it.
She denounces an election campaign tainted by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After suppressing the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for illegally demonstrating, according to his lawyer, continuing to be banned from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovietus
After these unexciting parliamentary elections, two much broader questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper yesterday announced the date of the first round of presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which will elect government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
This is tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovietus, they are not master of their fate, says the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes even further back: in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe, bourgeois society has developed only very slowly; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has again built on the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians freely renounce the personal responsibility that they have shown for a short time after the disintegration of the USSR.
Why think about it for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all walks of life, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional leaders) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as they were in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why think for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why replace them?
A heavy reminder
After being kept confidential for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed over a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be viewed until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individual and name-related, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his relatives.
In May 2006, the eleven states entrusted with its administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to make it available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow them to conduct research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of forced laborers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were against making these name-related documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as, for example, the alleged homosexuality or the intellectual disability of some deportation victims.
The inmate lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen handle tens of thousands of personal inquiries.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in accessing Bad Arolsen.
One should not expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, explained Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, the mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s most important trading partner, accounting for 18% of India’s foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
Last April, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), with reciprocal trade between India and Europe reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of India’s foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to figures from the European Commission, India is only the EU’s ninth trading partner.
A free trade pact will greatly advance the two economies and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, the European Commissioner further explained. The Asian and European giants annually exchange goods worth 47 billion euros and services worth 10 billion euros, had this week declared Daniéle Smadja, chairman of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, and regrets that the mutual trade between the European Commission and the European Union has not yet exhausted its potential.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern, offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion for five weeks
The Bank of England expressed concern on Thursday about curbing the currently recurring concerns over credit conditions, announcing a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion offer at a base rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they will organise their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation, to be given to a five-week notice .
The bank further explains that this way, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation at 12.15 GMT on 6 December, at the property tax rate and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE has put liquidity into circulation for five weeks in an open market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it stands ready to take further measures to maintain the different rates of interbank loans with their base rate, which differ from day to day.
The interbank rate, which differs from one day to the next, was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has leveled off to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer’s financial crisis, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalties that had prevented the banks from taking advantage of them.
According to certain rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound exchange rate as opposed to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank, at more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS’s proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, produced in the context of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping), indicated about ten measures adopted by the PS National Committee on Wednesday, the majority of which were 50% for the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIPP fleeting, a transport check or the restriction of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to sometimes violent exchanges between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television post on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MPs Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the entirety of their proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of finances, which had been reviewed by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumours regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has served, no more and no less, as a role model for the current festival movement in America,” Charlie Jones of C3 told Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping vacations.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The head of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the management of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, in his capacity as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he’s ever been to, says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working side by side to provide the area with a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We negotiated with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates regarding the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents brought Lollapalooza Festival back to life at Grand Park Chicago in 2005 after making a name for itself in the world of festival in 2002 along with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events each generated $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in gross tax days.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a rural festival, whereas ours is more on urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, in order at the same time to convey the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban one in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“Vineland’s community, including the mayor, is taking the burden of this event with joy,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to divulge the terms of the agreement, but he confirms "that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to host a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s recording capacity is “very large,” equivalent to about the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
“Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, which has received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal will face the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal, if no less than the Terminator opposes it.
These attempts are among the tasks of the delegates.
A politically "sensitive mandate" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the “governor”?
“You have to be careful because it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best,” he says.
The Run to the Festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the advancement of the local cinema is a top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the West Coast, although that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The Dark Ages had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market facing a final year rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks to the end of the year on the stock market, investors are already rubbing their hands with regard to the upcoming end-of-year rally.
However, the experts are unable to make any reliable forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock market is usually accompanied by a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially not if tensions to be taken seriously determine the current market situation.
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last weeks of the year, they note that the stock market price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and market participants, who invest mainly in bond funds due to the lack of safe equity funds, which is strongly affected by the upturn in the trend towards high-yield assets.
As a result, according to these experts, the stock market is more likely to show a lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, mainly because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible fall in the Fed’s interest rate, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the increased price of crude oil and the risk of the rise in the inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold moment to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost 4% since its peak of 15,945.7 points on November 8.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully close the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the mutual funds and the traditional grant from the pension fund made every year at this time.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could develop a little differently; especially due to the end-of-year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and therefore directly after the bridge day to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, market assessments so far are on a near technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values, the extent of which depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
When selecting the values that will drive the ibex to new heights, the analysts agree.
Solana of Intermoney asserts that this year the big values are next.
Among the value winners, the expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sector.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been catching up in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, the expert said.
In terms of increased consumer behavior during the Christmas period, the last half of the year, the periodic consumption will determine the market.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in small numbers in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has had only two declines.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, it led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-of-year rally so far.
This year, when the Ibex 35 caught up by 28.17 percentage points, December showed a 6.68% rise in price.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex has increased by 8.36%) and whether it will also have a final year rally, will be revealed.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of these are located in Spain’s strongest economic regions.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular is the first banking group to dare to extend the opening hours of its branches to 8.30pm on weekdays and from 10am to 8.30pm on Saturdays.
The BBVA banking group, which also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The Bank’s ongoing negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aimed at reaching an agreement in which 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open on a weekday in the afternoon, albeit not to customers.
Whether other banks will join the new initiative, which will adapt to business hours, will depend on Popular Bank’s experience.
And this is precisely the intention that Popular is pursuing with its project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those stores that, due to their location, can capture the shoppers of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new, but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones, while at the same time aligning them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The expansion of the opening hours will be combined with a new interior design of the stores, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, more colorful design.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, the bank’s representative, said the restructuring did not require major investments, but was accompanied by an increase in staff recruitment, as a branch no longer required six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine stores in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, according to <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The branches of Bravo Murillo, O’Donell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a have been chosen for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages approximately 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit, which specializes in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these stores of PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We don’t want to be a competition for our customers, Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally come to the agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its market value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We made it.
With this phrase, Telecinco CEO Paolo Vasile announced his satisfaction at the close of the stock market, the channel he led had increased its value by two times its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that’s exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not fallen too low.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, goodwill now reaches €4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the majority of the capital (52%), and Vocento holding only 13%.
Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, bringing its market value to 2,193.46 million.
The market value of other listed communications companies, on the other hand, is increasing; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in the case of Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) to 2,518.53 million and in the case of Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that they are two similar companies, according to Vasile.
It is still uncertain to what extent we can actually act in terms of stock exchange technology, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its intention to become the first TV channel to receive more than 1000 million gross revenues from advertising revenue this year, said Guiseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the group’s advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock market (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business increased by only 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor behind Telecinco’s better-than-expected stock market performance is the company’s high payout ratio to date: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a generated a 100 percent dividend payout.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as the parent company, could still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always stated significantly more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stock values we have already increased by buying 33% of Endemol shares.
According to the analysts, the market currently has some loss tendencies.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its Telecinco profit calculation for this year by 4% and for 2009 by 7%.
This is due to the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced Antena 3’s expected profit calculation for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective return and sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buy) measures a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (hold) due to the multiple incentives and the prospering market.
3.
JPMorgan recommends that, given the similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate), expectations be reset in both cases
Congress approves MIFID’s directive, which came into force on November 1.
In parallel to the parliamentary elaboration that ended its session today with the congressional resolution in the Senate on the supplementary/amendment motions related to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the congress and senate deputies, who in their negotiations and votes had the goal of establishing the best possible regulation, which ensures the safety of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities, in order to guarantee a generally efficient market.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, MIFID, which re-establishes the Securities Services Regulations, aims to improve investor protection, increase the claim to control of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows for the provision of financial advice to both specialised firms and to natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services firms (ESIS), the consultancy firms that join forces with investment and brokerage companies of securities.
It also increases the number of financial transaction execution systems, adding to regulated circulation markets the multilateral securities trading systems and the systems for internationalising trade orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic players.
The law obliges investment companies to disclose the main points of their company profile, the confrontation and forms of dealing with risks in the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Economic Commission of the Congress planned further changes in retrospect, whereby the decision that the securities must now be regarded as complex financial resources for the investor due to their high degree of risk, has been confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis.
It also took advantage of the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the areas of activity of qualified economists; 30 years after 1977, the regulation restricting the areas of activity reserved to economists was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the business mediator working on behalf of others, who does not require authorization from the CNMV and who can offer its services for the commercialization of products and for the acquisition of customers simultaneously several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (CPI) rose by five-tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to compare the location and quality of U.S. products by disclosing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared ahead of time by using the same approach as for the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the indicator identified ahead of time would only serve as a guide and would therefore not be in line with the final result to be announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November was a temporary development; at the same time, he assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes noted in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current figure is not good, Spain’s inflation differential with the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also explained that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, where the government did not expect such a large increase.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economy and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock to generate more than €42 billion in revenue over the next three years
Northern Rock’s holdings have fallen by more than half after the bank asked the UK central bank for an emergency loan in mid-September last year due to the crisis, and they are now only <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (equivalent to €16,800 million).
At the time, the bank’s assets stood at a record <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a sum that has fallen significantly within two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence and will continue to decline until the end of the crisis, despite the government’s 100% guarantee that the money is safe.
Virgin, which would continue to operate the group under the Virgin Money brand after the acquisition, will have to contribute about a quarter of the income of the British banks that will be made up of the assets over the next three years, in order to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to reach its target of 30 billion.
The group of multi-millionaire Richard Branson, known for its eye-catching advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to funnel <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 million annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, which has three other companies, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested on suspicion of involvement in urban corruption
The Spanish police have arrested this morning the current mayor of the village of Totano (Partido Popular), which belongs to the municipality of Murcia, on the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption, which was revealed this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo served as the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Popular Party and at that time chairman of the Totana Municipal Council, and according to information from the broadcaster Cadena SER may be the original mastermind of the plot.
Officials continue to search the community’s and the Department of Urban Planning’s business records and will not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused by Juan Morales, the prime suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular and consequently privileged MP Juan Morales was arrested on leaving the residence of his client on the basis of important incriminating documents that are supposed to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report on Morale’s alleged payment of contracts to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban development contract, in which the development of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in pre-trial detention.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and, if elected, in Congress.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, if the Socialists win the election, to take over the office of President of the Congress.
This was announced by José Blanco, PSOE’s secretary of organisation, and Bono at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party’s headquarters.
According to the Prime Minister, the offer to the former minister is justified because it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the coming elections, the Mancha-born politician would appear to be running for the party as chairman of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n as Congress President, who announced last November 15 that he would no longer run in the next general elections, end his career in public policy and instead work in the university sector for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the president of the government had continuously pushed for his return to the political scene.
He also pointed out that, as with the appointment of the Vice President of the Economy, the party did not want to withhold from the citizens who would take over the post of Congress president in the event of an election victory, and described this as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take office, he hopes to transform the Chamber into a house of respect and not of insult or gossip, in order to make it appear more and more like the citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time one gets the impression that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak calmly and calmly is the Congress; so the President of the Government in the Senate was interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current president Manuel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n and his good work and indicated that he did not want to give the appearance that he had already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate is subject to merciless criticism both by climate change skeptics and by those who put a social and political debate in the foreground, the movement as a whole must show a strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal puts him in dire need of explanation regarding the actions or non-actions of his government, which have made a decisive contribution to Spain being at the top of the EU’s list of countries that have least met the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are those responsible for non-compliance, to which sectors this is due, and why has his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to explain to the Spanish citizens the measures he intends to take against climate change.
Which companies will be affected, which behaviour of the citizens should be changed, which individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and what economic consequences will result from this.
More specifically, who will have to sacrifice themselves and pay for saving the planet.
However, there has been and will be no such explanation in the future.
This is because it is about sacrifice and payment.
Because the measures that can be used against climate change in real life are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE seemed so dangerous from an electoral point of view that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician for election campaigns does not have to talk, accuse or demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue of decorating the meetings and to inspire others with his gentleness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not stipulate that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or we may only refresh ourselves with a fan.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to a supposed involvement in urban planning corruption.
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the popular politician José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, as well as the local police chief, the mayor’s office secretary and a hotel operator on suspicion of urban planning violations.
The city council was arrested at its residence, from where it was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises it is located up to the present time, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and at the municipal construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the investigations that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where it turned out that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped land for urban development projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria should be redesigned, which was to build 4,000 apartments on the property after the local administration paid it illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other people were not arrested directly, but were subjected to an investigation, which is initiated and carried out by the first court of Totona.
The first six people arrested were brought before the judge today.
According to investigators, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP MP Juan Morales are also being investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend residing in Murcia are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra), as was the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company functions as a subgroup of Nuaria and is said to have received the bribe.
The investigation is being carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban crimes, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives carried out eleven additional searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry industry, which is said to have acted as a middleman.
The construction group Nuaria was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Murcia, which would include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometres of land in Totana, which was to be converted, with the aim of realising a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking lots of the streets Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and that of the Plaza Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the field of direct marketing and Preconiza, which specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the term Book of the Month and instead try to invent a price term with other names with appropriate competencies.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are welcome to submit your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the head of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on 18 November; coincidentally on the day the edition of which contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the subject philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a high school diplomat who quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
In an interview with the daily Helsingin Sanomat, Pekka Elo, chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, urged teachers to take a more critical position towards Plato and suggested that Plato’s teaching be removed from the lower-level curricula for philosophy at high schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of the law, which would affect six months in prison.
However, if you rob a music store of less than 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, then the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than for a download (Article 234 Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still less than a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less difficult to participate in a brawl than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious dispute results in a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in a deprivation of liberty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered to be less serious than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. Trafficking in copyrighted films whose authorship has not taken place is subject to a higher penalty than distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague is right, then someone has screwed up his demands quite a bit.

My family doctor hands me one of his long, strange research articles, entitled: Money leads to activation of certain areas of the brain, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings arising from the monthly salary are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was created using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest issue of the science journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn-based brain research center Life&Brain, activation was strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his partner failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activity was always very moderate if both participants were correct with their answer and therefore also received the same level; but if one of them received twice as much, there was also greater brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually requires so much scientific effort to arrive at such a result.
The Prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly searching for the Balkan war criminals for eight years, and her office is located in the prosecutor’s office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, based in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and a laughing eye as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre – which killed eight thousand Bosnian Muslims – namely ex-General Ratko Mladic and former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic remain at large.
Their names are on the list provided by Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that, at the speed of a political thriller, follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her intention to track down the escaped criminals and to put pressure on the respective governments to tighten their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
Car insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of the creation of the driver's license, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.
This agreement is recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to provide the corresponding compensation amount in the event of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance composed of several factors, including age, gender, time of issue of the driver’s license, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
The insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that in the event of a higher risk of accidents, higher contributions are also due.
For this reason, both 25-year-olds and women have to make fewer contributions, because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since they tend to have fewer accidents than single persons according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the conviction of the companies.
The benefit attributed to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus also the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, the insurance companies must take into account a whole series of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that is most likely to meet his personal needs.
We now list the most important points to consider when choosing an insurance policy in order to be able to make not only a performance-based but also a price-oriented choice.
The under 25s encounter numerous obstacles when choosing an inexpensive insurance, such as the low driving practice and the young driver's license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance coverage to take out a comprehensive insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full insurance with deductible, so that the services of a full insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract entails that the customer must pay a part of the amount incurred by the damage himself.
The amount is determined before the contract is concluded and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain’s chief representative at First Europa, an online insurance brokerage company.
Another option is the extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused to their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you’re under 25, it’s up to you to reduce insurance costs, so your credit will increase by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate at the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in said tariff.
The amount of credits and penalties depend on the company and its earnings.
If the company has had a high-yielding year, it may allow itself to increase bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract, due to the fact that the accident rate decreases with increasing driving practice.
Thus, it makes the most sense to opt for a comprehensive insurance with deductible.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice, after the fear of the beginner has been removed.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to take out comprehensive insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the respective person also allows.
On the part of the insurers, married couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a fully comprehensive insurance with excess (for an amount of around 300 euros) would be the best option. In the event that you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which only starts at the third vehicle year.
They drive more relaxed overall and have greater purchasing power that allows them to charge a higher contribution, Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a comprehensive insurance with excess (for an amount of around 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which only starts with a sufficiently high credit.
Ultimately, it is important to note that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it carries high costs that require a thorough selection to be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes for the point for the round of 16 in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight for the point in San Siro next Tuesday to reach their respective goals before the end of the Champions League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while the latter decides on their participation with the Scots.
The Italian team already have five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points need another to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D matches will take place a week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where they will compete for the first time in the semi-finals on the 13th, which will take place on the 16th.
This group will be finished ahead of all the others and the draw at Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the expected result, even if both teams will try to win, because the Italians will not want to speculate at home that the Celtics Glasgow know that they would be group first in the event of a victory and thus have a better starting position in the round of 16.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be a defeat in a slump of FC Shakhtar to qualify. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because in nine points tie the Ukrainians are entitled to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but could win in the second game (2-0).
They hope to reach the round of 16 of the transformed Champions League for the second time in a row, after they were defeated in the same round by a goal by Kaka in extra time (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw on the first leg of the season.
While FC Shakhtar waits for the Rossoneri’s victory, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the round of 16 and joining UEFA will depend on his victory and a Celtic Glasgow defeat.
Despite his lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win third place and thus play in UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
In Vancouver, Canada, the Spice Girls kicked off their first tour after the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before the start of their concert at the stadium GM Place de Vancouver that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people could watch the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video about the history of the band, which had caused a sensation at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, and which will be released in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden armbands on stage, which Posh Spice's husband, English footballer David Beckham, had previously given them.
The sportsman was among the fan crowds in the audience that made the GM Palace glow, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the Schow, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star has never seen our wardrobe before, so I am very curious to see what he will think of the performance.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements two years later led to the group's dissolution, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings towards the Spice Girls had changed.
And so I thought, why not, so I’m glad to have made that decision, Chisholm commented on the breakup of the band she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also announced that the disputes had been resolved and that they were all very happy again.
However, many things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in Vancouver on a Virgin Airlines special plane, according to a report from the television channel CTV.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was welcomed by an army of nanny girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on 23 December.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is smoldering between Ukraine and Russia, raising the risk of Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe.
Most of Russia’s natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are routed through Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow is happening at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be charged more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for Gazprom’s imports.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks,” Ukraine’s economy minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which drove up prices dramatically.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s supply.
Russia has the world’s largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve controls on criminal records for workers from outside Europe, a member of the control body said.
The recommendation of Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought to Scotland in connection with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish government health service has no precise idea of the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The chief financial controller investigated personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a 4x4 was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at the Old Bailey in October and was charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attack in Britain.
The State Health Service is expected to carry out checks prior to hiring foreign staff to ensure they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the Agency does not have the authority to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main auditor's report now says, among other recommendations, that the board should take up guidelines of the criminal record extract, which helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we found evidence of these controls in some personnel records, these were not routinely performed," the report noted.
Black said Scottish health authorities would closely follow their investigative guidelines before hiring, but added: “Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure accurate information on the number of foreign health care workers is available.”
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was “extremely unlikely” that investigations leading up to the hiring of potential NHS staff would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
“The report states that NHS Scotland’s current pre-employment tests are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver,” he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the boards have problems identifying those employees who are on indefinite leave.
The investigation further noted that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian have been largely complied with.
These include passport, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidance on pre-employment controls for foreign personnel in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “It was my concern to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.”
She added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the report’s recommendations and ensure that the best practices would be reflected in updated guidance on pre-employment screenings from all staff – including those from abroad – whose publication is scheduled for next month.
Joy Division to dominate film awards ceremony
Control, the film biography of late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including Best Picture.
Awards were also given to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role in Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for bringing British film to the world.
The awards were presented in a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control followed Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at age 23.
The black-and-white film, which features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot for just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
Nevertheless, he has brought the Dutch photographer Corbijn, so far best known for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, two awards - as best director and best director debut.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer received the award for best documentary.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg’s London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nile by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me,” he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He’s my type of person, a great actor of his time, I’m really honored.”
The independent film awards, known as bifas, are selected by a group that includes filmmakers, actors, and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia over terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for their affiliation to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant as well as on clerics and security forces.
The state television of the world’s largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle in missiles.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid response force to protect facilities following a failed Al Qaeda attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, citing an interior ministry statement, says 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell headed by a “missile expert” who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the detainees were planning to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clerics to do more to stop Saudis striving for Iraq to join with Al Qaeda militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is seen as heretical by the hardliners among Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias consider many clerics in Saudi Arabia to be cooperating with the authorities in supporting the policies of the royal family that dominate the government.
The militias – accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government – are targeting foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector assets.
"This has been a very big effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told state television.
The arrests also involved a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims supporting violence against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal a view of the future of the Earth
Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from an orbiting European spacecraft show that the planet is even more like a distant twin of Earth than was previously known.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, conditions would have prevailed on Venus that would have been very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbridled carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rate of rotation, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is devoid of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a sobering look at how Earth could evolve in the face of catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the heads of the Venus Express mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
“Our new data allows us to construct a scenario where Venus started billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment.”
'Improved uranium' seized by police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said that three people were arrested and that the material is being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
All still open
Mitt Romey said he does not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency ultimately agreed to face a debate on YouTube in which ordinary voters record questions on video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman who polled Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time accurately reflected the state of the Republican Party, which is heading into next year’s elections.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate with those who selected YouTube clips to show the prospective candidates.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
This is one of the most important issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to serve a ballot when they heard things they liked: The television station noticed spikes of approval as the candidates spoke strictly across the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national frontrunner, and Romney, who pushed himself forward in the decisive polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the call that he was yielding to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney by accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two argued particularly fiercely when the questioner asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
More insignificant candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to catch up on this issue.
Neither of the men has a serious chance of getting the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they’ve hit the immigration snag earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, candidates broadly share the same views: tighter borders, intolerance of illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, help Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the position that although the Bible was his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — now in first place in a recent Iowa poll against all odds thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism — said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed as to whether Jesus would endorse them, he laughed and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee’s rise to power in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul’s recent fundraising successes and his acclaim in Wednesday’s debate.
These two have been shot up out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the beginning and convincingly united with a victorious message about the greatness of America and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Labour Party's pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No nobility titles seem to have been sold, no politician paid Paris hotel bills, no extramarital toes sucked.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has been covering up donations to the British ruling Labour Party over more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something without which the embattled Gordon Brown would have done well.
When, two months ago, the Prime Minister shied away from calling for an election, stupidly insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, increasingly astute Liberal Democrat deputy chairman, put it, the once-feared Brown has evolved from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a battered bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change tax laws have turned corporate associations against the government.
The tax authorities’ loss of personal data of 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative fusses.
A trio of retired generals launched an insurgency in the House of Lords in protest at cuts in military spending: to be a minister of the armed forces, they claimed, is a part-time job.
Now there are the many and varied donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s Secretary General (and her former Head of Fulfillment) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is irrevocably heading toward resignation.
Yet governments can reach a tipping point where they feel it is impossible to govern.
Neither like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it’s clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he doesn’t even need to be around for long, that delay is over: public service begins to leak; cabinet ministers begin to chat; the press searches for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax records, for example, are related to decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s misadventures — as in the long “money for nobility” investigation of political party funding — voters may assume he was.
Still, Brown's situation isn't quite as bad as it looks
The crimes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one has died, or been completely swindled.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown’s, of course, Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new buzz about political donations is a good example.
The Garboeske Abrahams, who compares his donations to his charitable gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his benevolence.
That may be the case, but the decision was not up to him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham’s agreement, but not that it is illegal, will naturally have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour’s chief financial collector, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these confusions, even though most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered down that determination by grasping at a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - led to make the measure full, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "teachings to be drawn from" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding something like a permanent chair for the independent committee on standards in public life that has been vacant for six months, and moving forward with a sweeping reform of political party funding.
That would require Labour’s hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly abandon the special financial relationship with the unions – bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through indisputable integrity and solid competence.
Sharks
Is the credit crisis catching up with America’s credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is only natural for dorsal fins to whirl around excitedly.
Now that America’s real estate market is hurting, predators are targeting the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of contagion from underfunded credit spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both write-offs and default rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are each non-recoverable or more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its American consumer financings, in part because of the weakness of credit card holders.
It is too early to panic.
Losses and delays are still low.
According to credit rating agency Moody’s, the third-quarter margin of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A 2005 change in U.S. private insolvency laws led to an abrupt fall in bankruptcy filings, which in turn accounted for a large portion of the credit card losses; the number of filings (and thus default fees) would increase again, whether or not the general conditions for borrowers were worsening.
Industry also reports solid payment rates, showing how much of their debt consumers pay off each month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stalemate in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the output for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: it’s more likely that consumers are taking on credit card debt, now that home loans are drying up.
However, card issuers look at the cash flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower’s creditworthiness.
They can even be beneficial to the card issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates fall when the real estate is worth less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also respond to the stormier conditions much faster and more flexibly than lenders by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and completely re-evaluate the loans,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis is unlikely in the credit card market, the risks of a sustained downturn are significantly more real.
If lower house prices and a credit cut push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grimmer future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
UK bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers to be tried for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their petitions to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded not guilty to seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial scam in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications means.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK over the course of extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
The charges originally filed against them in 2002 drew Fastow's attention to the fact that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron decline.
The indictment against the bankers – dubbed the “NatWest Three” – claims they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraudulent plot involving Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron mercenaries who helped tore the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew that in reality it had considerable value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the bank's stake in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Copper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely advised Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its stake in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others pocketed about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in Enron's bankruptcy.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison sentence at the Louisiana Federal Prison.
Copper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was at large on a $1 million bail that required them to live in the United States in anticipation of the trial.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh-largest company, crumbled into bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer disguise billion-dollar debt or make weakening ventures appear profitable.
The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges became null and void after he died of heart disease last year.
Not all the way down in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that's change for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you are asking for so many seats because it's for a private family or a corporate president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the millionaires’ exhibition, a four-day orgy of exhibiting consumerism held in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had set up display stands, hoping to attract newly-monetized Russians to everything from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-coated auto barbecues that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
"This is a nice car, but it's change compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Fuelled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas did in its heyday.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went in droves to Europe where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian high flyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians stand out as the world’s most visible generous money issuers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a luxury industry conference this week attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford, and Bernard Arnault, Chairman of LVMH, to share ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who own a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which together are worth $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private wealth in the former Soviet Union written by economic experts from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert panel here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below subsistence levels.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow — that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for David Morris, a London-based jeweller.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-groomed and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they parade through the halls in evening clothes on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, refer to themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she was wearing, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The show seemed to be aimed primarily at the new rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to spend several hours in traffic jams to visit a drafty warehouse that brazenly side by side put Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made billiard tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt painting made of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old by Russian standards) have already moved from grandiose logos to the kind of sober brands with limited numbers that would not market themselves at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, ambassadors of millionaires or simply tourists, thronged the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said his company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that tailors luxury cars to customer needs, said he had sold three car radiator grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom that resemble linked chain bracelets for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, making it look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a quadruple replacement.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily ride on those wheels," Mr Karapetian said.
"He's going to keep it in his 30 or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase “Russian millionaires” wouldn’t express much exclusivity right now, given the rise in local property prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth run by Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company had set up four British-style red telephone booths, crammed with mountains of fake million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the millionaires’ fair.
Passersby stopped to tossing the piles of money around, taking cell phone photos while sitting back amidst the spare wealth, being snapped by friends, or simply pocketing a few million.
“You see, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Mr. Karryev said.
Confused operation suspected of fatality in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched an ambulance stop at the white Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the medical coroner's van approaching," Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, said Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now, investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, whom the police did not identify, who was working at the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxocological investigations, the results of which may not be available for weeks, will help elucidate a mysterious death that has sent a grief message through the top Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hardworking and persistent,” Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my pit bull.
She protected me.”
McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgical treatment.
"That's one of the possibilities," Mrs Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 a.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was pronounced dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about her investigation or about the owner of the house, who is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro’s house, where a withered rose bush stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable, helping him navigate the provincial and tough political culture in his new city.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this or that,’” he said.
“She was always here when I arrived and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates lead to a rise in global stock markets
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm credit markets by further rate cuts were bolstered by appeasing comments from the vice chairman of the US central bank.
Stock markets surged in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the No. 2 of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the central bank, said politics needed to respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to ongoing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm dreary markets, in the face of signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence had "partially reversed some of the improvements in market functioning from the late part of September and October."
Should the increased turbulence persist, it would increase the possibility of further tightening of financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street, amid further bad news from the U.S. economy, now that U.S. property sales hit a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workers, in a cost reduction measure to offset heavy losses from its lost bets in the U.S. mortgage lending sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 index rose 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of UK defaults.
Germany’s index Dax rose 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Previously, the resurgence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand was granted at a significant 4.7 percent to an auction of three-month guarantees from the European Central Bank granted to European commercial banks, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow suit and feed more capital into the money markets in London increased when credit tensions saw the three-month “libor” rates for lending between UK banks rise by 6.59% to their highest since late September, after a continuous increase since November 21.
England faced with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of which is almost as difficult as the other.
Who should beat Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, is here on call, at least under this special title, to help Peter Moore’s head coach and Captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filling up with applications for national electoral offices, if not for those part-time.
Whoever doesn’t get the sixth racket position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and the sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to pin down exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of luck rather than ability.
It is not only in cricket, where selection is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricketer, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go under.
Of course, numbers have a big influence on decisions, but chances are there too.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a wicket and a racket must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better last season than, for example, when James Anderson, who will apparently play in the first Test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind is turning into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of opinion.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, still struggling at the time, who made the breakthrough to become a major Test cricketer and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youthful enthusiasm after another discussion in the course of today’s net session at Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
Shah speaks for his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six from Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22 years, and an excellent record against turned balls.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the Test at Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection by the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum from his hitting, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has a shovel-like joie de vivre.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket pitch and his attitude away from it was summed up when he recently rolled over a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from a distance, and enthusiastically say, "Did you see this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he taps his middle speed with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the real art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn’t mean Shah might not look good after all, if, as the Ceylon tea set suggests, he’s the one who’s going to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work – and to fight Al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have expired and others hoping the city will return to normalcy.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transports.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today, because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be postponed at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local US-backed militia had helped drive Al-Qaeda out of its bastion in the west of the capital and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven out of his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a hand-grenade attack after calling on his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they need my support and that of my boys.
That’s why I came back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the U.S. troop increase and the growth of local “groups of concerned citizens” who were armed and defending their neighborhoods in cooperation with the American military.
But more spoke of being forced home by visa problems and dwindling funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled from the sectarian death squads in the country.
“We were doing well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis not to give any more visas to force them to return to Iraq,” the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were expelled from Shia residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have subsided.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and lead to conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education does the Saarlanders depress the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday, for the 50th time, I told a non-Saarlander that we are not French" - this slogan self-ironically places the smallest federal state on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is ranked fifth in the Education Monitor of the Institute of German Economics Cologne (IW).
Thus, the universities cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries already by tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6 percent.
But also the state children bring the Saarland in an above-average number to the universities - many of them without a degree at the high school.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their studies at a vocational school, which means that Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the national average.
The possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are also comparatively strong.
In terms of population, dual study programmes are the second best in Germany.
Despite the practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"At the general education schools, we initiated a number of reforms after the first Pisa study," says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
In order for the children to start learning earlier, the last kindergarten year is free of charge - a model that is now also copied by other federal states.
Whether the performance of the students will improve sustainably will only be shown by future comparative studies.
In the case of Pisa 2003, the proportion of high-risk students fell from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians expect better.
And to the annoyance of the Saarlanders, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured in Pisa - otherwise one could score points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbors is mandatory at gymnasiums - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez turns the clocks around
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez has the timepieces in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
In Spain, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez becomes a joke character.
According to a new law, the clocks will be set to the world time minus four and a half hours, according to the Official Journal of Venezuela.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chavez, an enemy of the United States, justified his decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States had imposed on the world the division into time zones at full hours.
In addition, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced on Wednesday (local time) because of a hostage affair, the break of relations with the neighboring country Colombia announced.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not have relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
“I can’t do that because of my dignity,” said Chavez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The dispute was triggered by Uribe’s decision to withdraw Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez from the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which were concerned with the release of hostages.
Uribe had “spit Venezuela in the face” with his decision, Chavez had criticized on Sunday.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is also on everyone’s lips in Spain.
A new cell phone ringtone is causing a sensation in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was spoken by Spain’s King Juan Carlos, who was annoyed at the recent Ibero-American summit by the constant interjections of the left-wing populist and who had run over his mouth.
Germany threatens wage cuts in 2007
Despite the strong economy, German workers are at risk of a real wage loss this year, according to a forecast.
Experts cited a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could expect to have less in the salary account in real terms in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The fault is the modest wage development, the VAT increase and the price increases in food and energy," said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Bild"-Zeitung.
New burdens could also be placed on employees in the case of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not be embarrassed again to have to ask the federal government for loans or subsidies, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it became known that the price explosion in food and petroleum products drove the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the Earth's infernal twin
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: The European space probe "Venus Express" has detected lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices at the poles, as they also occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it flashes on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided the proof - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on Venus shoots at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "primordial soup theory", lightning has created life on Earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean, which led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If there ever was life there, it must have been in very early history,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is around a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be Earth’s devil twin, but it’s a twin,” Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has taken such a completely different development is the basic question of the ESA mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the beginning of the nineties no probe was on the way specifically for the exploration of this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underscore the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities between our neighbouring planet and Earth are greater than initially assumed," the ESA said.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents on the terrestrial winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in just under 225 days.
But it revolves much more slowly around itself: A Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus barely resembles Earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets originated under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated, which remained in oceans on Earth, but on which Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on Earth, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama’s reception.
“We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue,” Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, stressed the Federal President, but protected Merkel from the accusation that she is pursuing a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows this too," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed displeasure with the Dalai Lama’s reception and had therefore been attacked from within the Union.
Steinmeier had complained, among other things, about the "shop window policy" of the Union in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership not only invited German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to information from SPIEGEL, also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
China’s Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the Dalai Lama’s reception as a mistake.
China rejects when European politicians officially receive the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama’s actions and words showed that he was trying to secede Tibet and the wider Tibetan region, which includes other provinces today, from China.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns of riots like in France
Street battles with the police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns of riots as in France.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not discharge itself into violence on the street, the Federal Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, rioters fired shotguns at the police: after the severe youth riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must make sure that social explosives do not also build up in us and discharge into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the Neue Presse in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The federal, state and local governments have already been working hard to reduce problems, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam conference, this already shows first successes."
But it is too early for a warning.
At the same time, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as there are in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had fought heavy street battles with the police in recent nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings were on fire.
However, the head of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the German government.
In the face of the riots in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as bad as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background under the age of 25 is “above average”.
Above all, more training places must be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The chairman of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany more than in France, "a social control in the families takes place."
Many young people with a migrant background also did not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat warned: "But we still have to be careful."
“We need to give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training quickly.”
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in action, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning trash cans and cars.
Since the previous day, an array of around 1000 security forces has ensured peace and quiet.
The police will take as long as it is necessary, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit in the suburbs.
During the night of Tuesday, around 80 policemen were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following eight, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots ignited in a traffic accident, in which two young people were killed on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the public prosecutor’s office, the police are not to blame for the death of the young people.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The Chancellor’s appearance away from reality documents that the coalition’s content is at an end – and that nothing more can be expected of her herself.
In which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After her bleak appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was spooky and content-poor, one has to say: not here - not in the country that would finally have to be governed by her.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she focuses too much on foreign policy with a very arrogant sentence.
This is provincial, she said, only showing that she does not want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, it has clearly documented for all, how much their accusation is true.
There was no concrete interest or even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a distinguished politician who flees into foreign policy and remains in danger even there.
Example of climate protection: She praises the decisions of Heiligendamm without restraint, but does not say how the climate goals are to be achieved in this country.
In any case, the self-praise - so much immodesty would have failed the CDU chief two years ago.
Now she clings to the phrase that the upswing arrives with the people.
In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of making the world look beautiful.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-income people?
She has a few minor phrases left for that.
It is important to remember how many times you have to deal with child support.
Merkel needs three attempts to produce a semi-straight sentence.
It stumbles like on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attack
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a hard-fought exchange - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already discharged on the first topic.
He has made New York a "refuge for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
“I would say his own house was a haven for illegals,” Giuliani counters, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing undocumented immigrants privately.
The candidates are blaming the attack: Because the Republican base still does not have a clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-made 30-second videos that Internet users have sent in via YouTube are hardly more than a keyword.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, is getting heavily read by the Vietnam Veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding," a method of interrogation that simulates drowning, as torture.
The reaction of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that the important topics of the campaign are now beyond the Iraq war and the debates on torture.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases rejected, cheers are heard in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney says condescendingly, pleading before the base and television audiences that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, gets into trouble when he is asked about his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian life
One day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani leader Musharraf has been sworn in as president.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, bowing to international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now rules as a civilian head of state for the first time.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another key demand is an end to the state of emergency that Musharraf imposed on November 3.
Soon after his swearing-in, Musharraf will, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, lift the state of emergency and thus fulfill another demand of the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied with jurists weighed in after the state of emergency was imposed at the beginning of November, had rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock Return
Germany’s supergroup of the seventies is making music again: The three band members of Harmonia took their consoles on again at a concert in Berlin.
For the revival, a recording from her great time "Live 1974" will be released.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The arranged sensation then takes place in the form of three seated gentlemen at the dinner table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and especially their buttons.
Dieter Moebius enthroned in a white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and in possession of laptop and guitar.
On the right, as seen from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is curling up concentrated at the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally blends into a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band plays Harmonia again has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
Here you can reveal: Targeted inquiries revealed that although the name swirled through the collective pop memory, it is by no means so sustainable to miss this band for 32 years painfully.
But why shouldn’t the German also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially since what is misleadingly called Krautrock has always been more true in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the survivors of the Cologne group Can the Echo Prize for their life’s work in 2003, the hall was filled with questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudation, the surprise knew no bounds.
At concerts Michael Rother later crouched on stage at the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the foreign is one thing.
Memory is already overwhelmed with harmonia because the trio only existed for two years and during this time also developed a far lower power of effect than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and subsequently earned a reputation as a guitarist with Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as city fleeing Communards.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague himself as a nanny.
Rather in an artist's life.
Allegedly, there was also a pennant of the singing club Harmonia Ottenstein in the bulky waste and a name for the art.
There was some harmonies about it.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next "De Luxe".
Because the music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered material hardship.
Collecting leaves was not just for self-discovery.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a nearly 50-piece record set, how someone thinks to remember.
At that time, von Rother had a desire to force harmony and occasionally practice it.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band announced their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric-Spherical and secured his existence with albums such as "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of cultivating Krautrock as its very own German contribution to living music.
Neu! was already excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is here, the British, Altpunk and author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
This would outline the entire range of influences of Krautrock on the subsequent pop music.
Harmonia fills the empty space of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's phrase floats in the hall with the strangest sounds: "The only true music, belongs to you the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with harmonia in the farmer's parlour.
The legend formation serves projections of further black and white photos of tangle-wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No longer by attaching microphones to the organ and the drums in order to elicit unheard-of sounds from the instruments via self-made effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in-depth technical inventors.
The chorus of the house doesn’t change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, people cough and whisper under clouds of sound and sing "Aaaaaaaah!" in a beautiful place with Emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in blues than in music academies (Can), technologies (power plant) or on the flight from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Those who shout "'68!" here are not entirely wrong, and Harmonia will not let themselves be disturbed by this even now.
Even the most obvious thing is thoroughly rethought on stage.
Where does music start and when does it end?
This can rob you of your nerves or give you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
"The Hunting Party" and "Murderful Peace" are two films dealing with the Balkan War.
But neither convinces.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and babble or they are too messy.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party"
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but just there, in the gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many nice and unimportant roles in feel-good films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism drove one the desire to watch.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - Wenn der J<0xC3><0xA4>ger wird zu Gejagten" (Why do movie titles today always have to be as long and confused as Lokführer tariff contracts?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically what could have become of Gere if fate and the film industry had not been so gracious: a man who has had his very best times long behind him, but who, even as a ruin-like monument to his decline, has preserved considerable remnants of the former charm.
But despite this trump card, The Hunting Party, along with the German production Murderous Peace, which also kicks off this week, continues only the endless series of failed Balkan War films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb woman from Kosovar snipers, whereupon one promptly falls in love with her.
Although it is to be welcomed that once the Serbs are not represented here as the sole root of all evil, the television-flat film loses itself all too quickly in fuss and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with war.
On the other hand, at "The Hunting Party" one can almost exemplarily investigate why there has never been a really good Balkan war movie.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian top war criminal "the Fox" might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with another director and another screenwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are strikingly similar: Both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something the military cannot do and both times it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the run-down cynic with heart than he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script also has to give him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
"The Hunting Party" then finally goes down the drain when the reporters succeed within the last five minutes in the time-lapse process, what NATO, CIA and all the bounty hunters of the world have not succeeded in five years: catch the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that they want to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinema logic.
The film has a deeply human purpose.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (for once they should agree here) not to pursue the persecution too intensively due to secret political collusion.
But the well-intentioned and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassionately I see the swollen forehead veins, indicating: how exhausting it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swell heads, but they hint at how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war film.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all Iraq films were Hollywood's big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South African film.
Almost always, when a star roams the hot spots or minefields of the world, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond All Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are simply too close in time.
After all, it took decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Many films will probably still mature - the now considered classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" were by no means unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today we know where every mass murder comes home in real time on two screens, just too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs screenwriters of the carelessness it takes to tell good stories.
"Being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good, after all, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don’t want to be good at making good movies.
Maybe you have to have the sarcastically distant artist view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied, "That's just because some things never change.
Big cities will always be horribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in horrible ways, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust receives criticism for Olympic cancellation
The departure of the mayor from Hamburg’s bid for the Summer Olympics has met with heavy criticism from politics and business.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But von Beust urges realism in assessing the chances.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, the chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described a waiver on Wednesday as "not good for the business location".
No other project has developed such a strong motivational force in the city in recent times as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the sport policy momentum would not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, “which assumes a changed timeline.”
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with earlier statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sportbund’s decision to apply for Munich for the 2018 Winter Games, which was expected at the beginning of December.
"This preference means for us that we will not have any realistic opportunities in the period we have envisaged so far until 2028."
Yet the dream was not dreamt out for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beusts.
This will give the impression that Hamburg will no longer want to compete for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to miss a chance by burying the plans already at this point," HSB President Günter Plo<0xC3><0x9F> said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application would also be contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception at the General Assembly of the Allgemeine Deutsche Hochschulsportverband.
There, von Beust called Hamburg’s application for the Universiade 2015 “not as a replacement” for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only last week nominated Hamburg as an applicant city.
The SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it put on the map Olympia and excluded the housing construction," said the SPD deputies Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD had always called for integrated planning for the Olympia and a later use of housing for the Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU had set on the "event factor" unilaterally.
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg had generated a great deal of enthusiasm at the time.
Hamburg, however, had failed at Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
If you combine the terms Sweden and wooden box, think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Is it?
Currently, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol’s catalogue of works.
A large part of the ninety-four "Stockholm-type" brillo boxes listed there are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's brillo boxes of 1968, internal investigations in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now come to a sobering result: The six "brillo boxes" that the former museum director Pontus Hultén on the international Umslauf bequeathed to the Moderna Museet in 1995 are also copies of the Brillo.
The prehistory is interwoven, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the "Brillo" soap powder.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 exhibited - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of cardboard Brillo boxes: these did not come from Warhol (for cost reasons), but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their role models, about mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission in 1968 to have a few Brillo wooden boxes produced in Sweden, which, however, were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of around fifteen boxes, which at that time were the authorized original Andy Warhol brillo boxes with the name "type Stockholm" and rightly entered the history of art and auctions.
Some of them have made more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, examined the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, as well as three privately owned ones, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their chipboards were first primed and sanded, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the chipboard with a paint roller without a primer - moreover, it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's brillo boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet, "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
However, back in July, the Authentication Board announced it was investigating the “serious allegations” made in the case of soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, they have been shrouded in unrelenting silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have given up hiding in a hotel in Manila, demanding the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Government loyal soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
Around half of them were on trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly settle down with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers who were supposed to guard him had apparently defected to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces closed off the district around the noble hotel.
The President called an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People have had enough,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the Scout Rangers’ elite unit, said other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the president for Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for months.
Manila's financial district was the main scene of the attempted mutiny of around 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after nearly 24 hours due to the army’s refusal to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
It now holds 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There had been speculation before about a takeover.
The option to increase the share of Versatel is kept open.
The move is intended to drive the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, speculation had already arisen about an entry, after Berenberg Bank has increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house considers the shares only for a third party, it said in the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had already invested almost 10 percent in the mobile communications company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
5.15 million shares of which United Internet has bought for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have started discussions about marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile radio products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesperson said.
The two companies have formed the joint venture MSP to acquire the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to settle with a share of a good ten percent in Freenet and not make use of their right to take over another 18.49 percent in Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all options open, in particular to further increase their participation in Freenet AG, it said.
Discussions between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
Freenet’s poker, which has been going on for months and is still difficult to see through, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and full-line customers.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch has so far directly held 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will contribute another around four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
