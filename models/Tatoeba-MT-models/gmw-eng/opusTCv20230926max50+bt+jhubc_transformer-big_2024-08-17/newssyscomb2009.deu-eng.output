Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, in total they come to 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought after the first preliminary results the early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of the previous chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the line.
In contrast, the Head of Elections of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the Carinthian Governor Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but loses 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP performed even worse, losing almost nine percent of the vote at 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially in the People’s Party, which had demanded the early elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP had left the coalition, the People’s Party had a clear lead over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
The voters, however, probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there was speculation about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case at an extraordinary meeting of the party board on Monday.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the election debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the grand coalition of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FP<0xC3><0x96>) provisionally received 18 percent, the BZ<0xC3><0x96> eleven percent of the vote - the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated, when the People's Party called for agreements with the populists (at that time the FP<0xC3><0x96> was still uniform, in 2005 it had split from the BZ<0xC3><0x96>) regarding a common government.
This development is obviously the focus of Jörg Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party and expects a return to Vienna in Austrian federal politics.
In addition, the party of the Greens moved into parliament, which, however, suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four percent hurdle and therefore did not move into parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who were charged in India for the illegal collection of beetles, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that there could be a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The minister stressed this in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this does not clear up, then certainly, then there will be a certain cooling," he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that it would be difficult for the executive branch to intervene in judicial matters.
Nevertheless, he argued that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted of the charges and was fined, the central government wanted with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi believes it would be best for him to appeal to a higher court.
He could thus request release on bail and wait in freedom for his verdict, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed the same in negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be possible for him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to give the convicted person "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said such help is already being offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK, in front of its partner, the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We really think it is a big mistake to detain and indict these Czech scientists,” he said.
The Minister did not answer the question as to whether he had received an undertaking from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
“I’ve been promised a lot,” he said.
A Czech judge on the struggle for the seabed
It approaches an electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-member team of staff of the UN’s Division of Oceans and Maritime Rights.
His boss, the division director, Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it to and from it.
There is work and enthusiasm here.
So far, the seabed is home to a little-known world rich in natural springs.
Here oil can be found, as well as ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
Today, the neighbouring states vehemently declared their claim to the new maritime areas.
According to a UN convention, they make use of their rights, which they agreed on in Montego Bay in Jamaica in 1982.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches into the sea up to a few hundred kilometers far from the shore of a country.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
Put simply, as a continental shelf is considered that part of the seabed and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the sea of shores, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be backed up by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have had success,” Mikulka adds.
An international response was recently met with the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly expand its maritime areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extent of the seabed, which was granted to the country by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigation.
The profits that will flow to them from the use of the seabed in the future will, as they promise themselves, have an inestimable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is referred to by the convention as the “common heritage of humanity.”
In this case, no state has a special position.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
“But the seabed is not a land of gold diggers,” Mikulka added, adding that the “individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored.”
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was granted the status of a so-called "ground-breaking investor" in 1991 on the basis of the convention, as well as the investors of a few other states.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"Promoting can be done there on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the division Rober Sandev brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with a little imagination, of the fabled Shem who, according to legend, brought the Golems to life.
German special forces were on site at hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special forces were ready, but they were not used.
With regard to the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt, more and more details are being revealed.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, both specialists of the Bundeswehr as well as officials of the GSG 9, the flying staff of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Police Office as well as logistics experts of the Technical Relief Agency were at the place of liberation.
The German forces, however, were not needed, as the hostage-takers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany in order to involve it as a local support force.
"Fortunately, this did not happen," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had kidnapped the group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and her eight Egyptian companions in the south of Egypt on September 19.
After the abduction in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages were deported back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear until the end, as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, there was initially no information as to when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Luftwaffe and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Refuses Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has narrowly failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went deep.
By 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals from US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority for the program to contain the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic move, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called on MPs to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he admitted.
As the vote progressed, the Dow Jones fell more than 6% or 600 points.
Investors were concerned that the state bailout package might fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after becoming aware of the failure, crashed again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence on the international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
For travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, the desire to travel of the Germans remains unclouded, according to a study.
In bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in sales compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced in Berlin on Monday.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, booking figures have already increased for the autumn months.
For example, the increase in turnover of travel agencies for October was around eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
These results are based on figures from GfK, which evaluates booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies on a monthly basis and calculates them for the overall market.
This includes travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the US is particularly in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the increase in booking amounts to around a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic areas, are particularly in demand among the Germans.
Package holidays in particular are highly popular, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, the costs are "more calculable for the customer than for individually organized holidays".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early bird discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also booked very well, so that a year-on-year increase in sales will be recorded again - although, according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from liter jugs and celebrities in designer dirndls.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don’t really have much in common.
She is blonde, TV presenter and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing unites us: Hardly three minutes on the Wiesn, the photographers rush at us and snap the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to serve its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the Wei<0xC3><0x9F>wurst equator, the feeling of well-being in the costume was still limited.
But once we get to the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or Lederhosn; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - all completely normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand harvest only my Dirndl apron.
A Munich woman draws my attention to the fact that I would have tied the apron incorrectly: "Left hoast frei, Mittel Jungfrau, right forgiven, widowed in the back."
Secretly I froze the bow from back to left.
"Fit," he said, laughing.
Others make less effort around subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats, on which stands "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch an uninvited the naked behind.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and also attends the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long drawn-out "ooooo".
He tells me this after he has emptied himself of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks is a trash can.
So, Bob is one of those infamous "Wildbieslers."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, paramedics run in droves across the festival square, who have to take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at a time tow a covered carry from tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: Empty, full back.
Who lies in the promille coffin under the tarpaulin, you do not see.
"These are the ones who are packing what's going on," one of the paramedics called to me on request and disappeared in the commotion.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex has been announced.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road in the city centre.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deeply into Turkey’s hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps inside Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the guides tell you.
The building sits at the end of the platforms with a tower at every corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart.
But once inside the vaulted ticket counter, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project, whose westernmost entrance was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Society.
Germany, which was a late straggler in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and further afield to what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperialist plans faltered during the First World War.
His railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha railway station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, largely ignored by history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it to highlight the expansion of Turkey’s diplomatic horizon.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the neighboring regions, produced by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key data of this new foreign policy, I boarded the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the AKP’s leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the pace of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is regarded as a new city, for the new secular state project, to turn its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has caused a lot of mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a custom-built, state-of-the-art stone and steel structure, in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
"The goal of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey and its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception,” he tells me.
Turkey was cut off from its hinterland.
Today, it has to look east and west at the same time.
There would not be either one or the other.
She would have to do both.
“But surely Turkey could be forced to make a decision at some point,” I asked.
“Turkey,” he said, “didn’t want to face this decision.”
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to here routinely said: Turkey’s relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be that, figuratively speaking, Europe as a whole can travel eastwards on those same rails towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha’s station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German gentlemen, Mr. Knight and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And as I waited at the dock for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At that time, at least, there didn’t seem to be much doubt as to which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Death" Handley was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was intended for young people up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979 some of us were already in our late 20s - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape changer) stood for the choir's willingness and ability to tackle any piece of music presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, a cappella or full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and existed solely thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for music, which never let up for years.
How often did Death keep us from "let the music speak for itself."
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never domineering but also never exuberant.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher one.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I have known him well for the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, during which he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 or so years or so, I’ve written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by a single one – often inspired by them.
Tod Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He detested conductors who, according to his words, simply “were peddling with one or two well-known show horses in the world.”
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950...while at the same time studying for a BSc, an MA and a Ph.D. degree.
This is a conclusion from an author's note in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States from 1950 to 1951 on a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino <0x60>Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me aware of them because of their simplicity and the power they radiate, how they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotions.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments.'
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda begins marketing the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this large-capacity sedan offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are also the technical subtleties that enable even more comfortable driving and save petrol.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made to this large sedan are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you start analyzing the new model, it must be said that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation had appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, the country where jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and throughout 2008.
After the release of jazz on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates are 10 000 cars, which is 17% of the assumed growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002, which is 6.7% of the total sales at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the head of the store in Spain expects to be able to sell 2 000 Jazz models per year.
In more detail, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model makes it possible to cover up the sales reduction in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to complete the year with a total sales of 22 000 models, which is 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% year-on-year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda is counting on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a 5-door, compact 4.7-meter hybrid car that the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to market estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed in the Old Continent and Japan.
The launch of Insight is planned for the first months of the year, and for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double load space, reaches up to 339 liters, i.e. 19 liters larger than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be emphasized that these measures are present in the version with a 1.4-litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the boot of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2-litre petrol engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, apart from the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, an improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high-torque performance for the entire engine runtime.
The first version with 1.2 liters achieves the power of 90 hp at 6 000 rotations with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 rpm.
This petrol engine - the predecessor of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto Bee' that avoids collisions
To drive forward the development of accident prevention technologies, this time Nissan was inspired by nature, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight is due to the swarming behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the Nissan Motor Co. Technical Development Center developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the bee’s compound eyes, which can see in all directions at an angle of 300 degrees, allowing it to fly undisturbed in its personal airspace without interruption.
In order to replicate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles that are located in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and are within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is immediately translated into signal for avoiding the collision.
At the moment when obstacle is noticed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels 90o or even larger angle to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to other arbitrary systems is that this evasive maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it were not, the robot might not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory for Mobility and the lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can neither deviate upwards nor downwards, but also not overtly; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way that the bees do.
For this reason, in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions, Nissan has used the rotation function so that the small robot avoids the collisions.
<0x60>This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and act on this information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres made to store, so it can work continuously with only a few tens of KB of storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs and not even the MBs of storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced to production cars over the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite, in order to lead when driving to the destination, while avoiding the obstacles on the way.
She's shaking before she's charged with a mortgage.
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to prevent U.S. citizens from getting involved in mortgage histories of supposedly solvent banks, an entertaining and informative game was developed for Internet surfers: “Bad Credit Hotel,” it says.
Or perhaps, the ‘hotel of bad credit’ or confusion.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Surely it has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a site for the teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen when the game expands?
Well, when a dreamlike room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley makes its capital available for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its business, making it the first bank in Japan to spend $9 billion, taking over 21% of its capital, an innovation that is due to a strong fall in its stock market price.
A week after a preliminary settlement was made public, the two banks stated that MUFG will buy 9.9% of the Morgan Stanley common shares at the uniform price of $25.25, giving a total of $3 billion.
The assumed price is less than 19% of the share price as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will provide it with a profit of 10% and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be conducted on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, i.e. 28% above the current price value.
Morgan Stanley’s stock, however, dropped 6.79% to $23.07 at 17.00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to holding bank status,” said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley assumed this status last week, allowing it to expand its operations to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest names to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the deal has changed over the last few days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply stated that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” said Toshihide Mizuno, managing director of MUFG in Tokyo, “we thought the shareholding would consist entirely of common shares.
But in light of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.”
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its market value for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will proceed with a reduction in profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares in one year if the latter are exchanged within a given period at more than 50% above the sale value, i.e. at approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable it to capitalize on investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its sales.
However, a spokesman for the group refused to provide details of the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said it had “significantly” lowered its balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, which had to watch its stock market price fall by half, while the price of insurance against insolvency skyrocketed.
This price declined on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of the major Wall Street investment banks following the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had withdrawn $15 billion from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Re-establishing the Republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Evo Morales and equatorian Rafael Correa.
It was that third party who this Sunday, following the example of his like-minded and friends, put up for election the plan of a new constitution.
According to the public results, which amounted to 80% of the vote, 64% voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order for the constitutional project to pass, one vote must reach more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations and a census of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for 'yes', predicting 63% to 70%.
In the night from Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The “constitution triumphed in an overwhelming way,” he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chavez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence according to the watchdog of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points to secure the “new socialism” for which the President is committed.
The constitutional project transfers state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to “development planning” in a country that largely thrives on oil production by foreign companies and the foreign exchange that sends emigrants into the country.
The project, promoted by the Correa, elected in 2006, also grants the head of state more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also secures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Ultimately, it also envisages banning the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an equatorial base as a base for U.S. anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched an attack on the hijackers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon, healthy and unharmed.
In the morning they were liberated by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military base al-Maza right next to the international airport of Cairo around 3.30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be examined there.
They enjoy all the "best health" and the kidnappers "have not been paid a ransom," said the Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the runway.
After being captured on 19 September on an off-road safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border region of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly moved from one hiding place to the next by 35 unknown hijackers.
There are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two guides, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the Agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official explained that 30 members of the Special Forces, on board two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
“On both sides, shots were fired and half of the hijackers were killed, the rest fled,” said the person in charge, who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is now, about the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
“We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our intelligence and special forces men,” he said.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
The night before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a patrol vehicle carrying the hijackers, killing six of them, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army declared that they were linked to a rebel group from Darfour, the movement Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), which however immediately denied this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate about the financing of culture makes headlines and is a central topic of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or national historical sites that are woefully starving?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting its monuments and culturally significant buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no proper laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing 3.5 million euros solely for the restoration of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbors have written in their country’s constitution that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all deputies and all government districts, by mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the Association of Quebec Historical Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers, gathered in 211 historical societies, strive to engage intensively with history, save with a few pennies the numerous private archives, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, protesting with the force of desperation when patrons and decision makers unleash their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux countries want to take care of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has fallen into turmoil due to the US financial crisis: The three states make a total of EUR 11.2 billion available to the banking and insurance institute, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands discussed at the highest level this weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the eurozone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has lasted for a year, so decisions now being made in connection with the bank could have a precedent.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank to about 49 percent.
The bank is expected to sell part of its holdings, most notably the insurance activities purchased by Dutch company ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis have started a steep descent last week, in the second half of the week already serious crisis scenarios are emerging.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a bankruptcy.
The Institute’s securities fell 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the Group’s market value amounts to EUR 14 billion, but this is unrealistic according to management.
According to management, the $700 billion American bailout and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is to blame for the decline in Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, prices rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the Bank’s new Director-General.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it has not found any interested party with a factual offer.
The Belgian government, however, was trying to calm down - no investor should tremble for his money, it said.
No panic has so far broken out among customers, the bank’s branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also names leasing companies its own.
Fox in the Chicken Coop
Because of a person’s drug use, life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to sign a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we entrust the chickens to the fox," Richard Dick, developer of the prescribing data tracking program, told The Washington Post.
Insurance companies set the fees and the payment amounts in the event of damage depending on the state of health of the customer, and if the risk is overestimated, the insurance will not be taken out in the first place.
Previously, the customer was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only with knowledge of the examination results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: using the customer’s identification number, he obtained the data for the last year and a half from pharmacies, i.e., which preparations were purchased, and the program calculated from this what disease the customer suffers from and what his state of health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood fat levels are untreatable high, which would automatically put him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so the insurance companies only have to do the paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many drugs can be taken for various purposes, such as against migraines and hot flashes, but also against depression.
The latter is a high-risk factor from the point of view of insurers, while the ones mentioned before are not.
For the consultation and processing of the data, own societies have formed, which, before they obtain the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they must do so by law, even though omissions have not yet been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and combine them with data on drug use to provide an even more accurate picture of patients’ health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and controlling their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect only extends to service providers in the health sector and insurance companies.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is not enough, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned can hardly prohibit access to his data, since the insurance companies otherwise do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are somehow left to the mercy of the fox.
Global meal plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
With the European Union and India both leading trading partners of each other, this was the main issue among other global issues at the Ninth Summit.
Today, the Franco-Indian summit will also take place, which will mainly discuss cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic great power that should be given more voice and voice in international affairs, the member states have not yet been able to agree on whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not even discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseilles.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, current President of the EU Council, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to an agreement to double trade in the next five years to a good 100 billion euros.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this goal is not even as ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally combined into one agreement, so that aviation will also be boosted in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the EU by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India’s number one partner, New Delhi is only ninth among EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively, terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides to blame for the failure.
The EU stressed that it is sticking to its energy and climate programme, i.e. pollutant emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed with this, as did the proposal to reach a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India will visit the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, they are hoping for orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be adopted for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for rights acquisition.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present more than 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honor of the event.
The Undersecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 m2 "Punto Italia" exhibition space.
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives around the publishing industry in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers is decreasing in the whole, but especially in the adult and youth sector.
Billionaire Steve Fossett's small plane found missing a year ago
The small plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire disappeared on a flight over the desert of Nevada on September 3, 2007, was found.
The items have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m altitude, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the aircraft.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said at a press conference: "The plane has been located where a troop has been sent out, and we now have the assurance that it is the plane Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Transportation (NTSb) noted that just hours after the plane was sighted, a crew was dispatched to identify the aircraft: the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett had embarked on a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal belongings were found by a couple near their home at Mammoth Lakes.
These are two badges named Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history by a long succession of records.
In 2002, in the sixth attempt, he became the first person to orbit the globe in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later he flew around the world in a single flight without a stopover with an airplane.
Among his numerous records is also an altitude flight of 15445 m over the Andes, but this with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A suv that, due to its original design and special lines, the expansive surface and its clear angles, falls out of the conventional schemes.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new life into the sector with this off-roader.
Due to its exceptional features, the presentation of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be on show in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
Thus, the advertising drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the car sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, which will be carried out in different phases, which will occupy the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, by November 15.
The first bevel will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses, which are distributed near the Corso Como, to give the whole a special look: the new SUV will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will so seemingly emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
The Elumina8 technology then illuminates the new Glk in all its details at different moments in order to reassemble it as a whole.
It is undoubtedly Mercedes’ concern with this advertisement to introduce a new type of auto advertising into this rather stereotypical field.
But will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from Triveneto – now they risk banning stadiums
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, until recently did not cause any serious problems.
There have never been any clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right-wing milieu.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These were joined in Sofia by other smaller groups from Campania and Puglia.
They carry the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: but these were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Her role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a clash with a truly right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
The Figc had provided Italian fans with 144 cards for the game: all of them were issued by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among those who travelled to Sofia there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already pre-loaded in this regard, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified in the riots can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums across Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
I'm glad.
But now, of course, there is fear of counterfeiters, who could follow them little more than 150.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and that in no case gives such behavior the opportunity to justify," the Viminal said.
Therefore, "eyes on especially also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
Indeed, in Puglia there is a small nucleus of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (sports supervisor) gathers, on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services, which deals with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed in no joy), who for a few weeks has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal (he took over the post of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously Mazzilli was the police chief of Trieste, where now a core of the supporters of the 2002 founded Ultras Italia comes from.
It is true, Mazzilli says, that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the duce, but undoubtedly the behavior of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - adds Osservatorio No. 1 - crimes are punished in the country of their act.
Until now, this group had been in check, but now it is necessary to rethink what has happened and what will happen.
But let us also speak of the whistles during the anthem Mamelis: this, too, is not a crime, but allow me, since education is lacking...".
