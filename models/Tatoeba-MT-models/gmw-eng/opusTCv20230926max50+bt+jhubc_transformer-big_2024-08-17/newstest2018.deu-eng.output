Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A crazy institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A crypt chapel, where is now being dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small-scale gardeners cultivate the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich brings exciting stories to light.
It is annoying when maps are not up-to-date.
Anyone who has ever had to get upset because the car navigation system indicated a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlas, an offer of the state government’s geoportal Bavaria, are anything but up-to-date – but that is precisely why they are very revealing.
Especially when you compare them to current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the distribution area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavaria Atlas is a patchwork carpet that is not immediately recognizable as such.
More detailed maps, so-called primordial position sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical picture of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the Peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801: it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.
Elector Max IV Joseph continued to advance the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek like all others.
The comparison Earlier/Today is most impressive on the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a Munich district 21 years after the map was drawn up, i.e. in 1877.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: Zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered pieces of land from the so-called "original photograph", from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots no longer occupy farmers - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sonne".
A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 site of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt one reads in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Luften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstra<0xC3><0x9F>e people were once imprisoned with delusions.
It was there that the Munich Circle Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded in 1858/59.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of the so-called madmen.
He also prohibited staff from using force against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Museum Haidhausen, who worked with the institution for an exhibition.
There was room for 280 patients at first, but later it was expanded to 500.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
It has been home to the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany’s largest psychiatric hospitals, since 2006.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.
To the west is the football field of the TSV München Ost, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - architecturally based on the original construction of the insane asylum, which had been destroyed in bombing raids during the Second World War.
The Marienplatz was listed around 1856 as the "main square", the Kaufingerstra<0xC3><0x9F>e was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs tore many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small commercial buildings and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn trunk line will take place.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled.
Civil Rights Group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to people of color who travel to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," the group said in a statement.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as state law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
“They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They’re stopped because of their skin color, they’re beaten up or killed,” said Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints at such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after running out of gasoline while traveling through the state and being held in custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office, which shows that black drivers are stopped 75 percent more often in the state than whites.
“The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends, and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be ready whether it’s bringing bail money or letting relatives know they’re traveling through the state.”
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s Hate Crime Reporting Program, which ranks the state at 16th place in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws that require local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the U.S.
Fence project is elementary
The Fischerbach pasture fence project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year.
The CDU members of parliament Peter Wei<0xC3><0x9F> and Kordula Kovac got a picture on the spot.
At the Schwendemann family's court yard, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, where he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and just as many young animals and hosts holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative way of marketing the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the pasture fence project as "elementarily important".
I cannot operate profitably on such steep areas.
The grassland area provides for a lot of work, many things have to be worked with the motor scythe.
"We are struggling here with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parental business and managed it without chemical crop protection and fertilizer, even if he does not run an organic business.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy about the Leader funding".
At a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that this will allow the reforestation of the areas to be pulled out for quite a while.
“The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they can continue their business,” he said.
Farmers are often criticised for their support
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced in via the pasture fence promotion.
The open area thus amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of 71,500 euros, half was funded through Leader, a quarter was provided by the municipality of Fischerbach.
This left the farmers 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible".
For Peter Wei<0xC3><0x9F> it was also clear: "Best food is produced here".
The Landschaftspflegericht (LPR) Baden-Württemberg (Landscape Care Directive) enables state funding of pasture fences.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
The prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor system designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced in must not be tractable (hanging inclination over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
The Fischerbacher pasture fence project 2018 is currently being applied for by eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build almost 16 kilometers of fence.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump’s White House takes up the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate them as much as anyone else - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN’s Jim Acosta over the president’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he had.
But he attacked its meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
As Miller scolded Acosta, “I don’t want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem to which you refer was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it’s not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your afflicted masses who long to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."
There has never been a time when the “poor waste” could be seen better on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump’s US.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus — and her friends, who were committed to placing their words at the base after her death — knew very well that they were performing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract – she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
The poem’s connection to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it back for a long time.
Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for Trump’s coming, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but rather is an early neoconservative who brings the American flame into the nocturnal world: “Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not light the way to the United States."
Limbaugh has come across something quite unusual here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it’s about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to kindle the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the team of Great Britain
UK Athletics Performance Director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championship squad will “make a massive contribution to the team.”
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we're going to carry it on until we find out," Black said.
“I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart – who will face Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000m track, while Eilidh Doyle has been selected by the team as team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Their captain’s speech was incredible,” Black says.
“A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room feeling very proud and very motivated.
The passion and genuine feeling that Eilidh naturally brought was great.”
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in her fifth World Championships at the 400m hurdles, says it’s “incredible” that 16 Scots are on the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes to date at the World Cup was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle distance runner Muir leads this way and set five British and two European records last year.
She will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O’Hare, who runs 1,500m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is “extremely proud” of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also participate in the medals and the finals.
“The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it very special for me,” she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to podiums.
As for my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it’s really important to bet on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking Critics Through Facebook: Don’t Apply for Public Office If You Can’t Afford Electoral Inflammation
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn’t long before the newspapers beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded the critics, of course.
But he did not silence his critics.
In 1783, Washington said: “Freedom of speech can be taken away – and, dumb and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter.”
That brings me to Maryland to see Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor’s staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with “Well, and?”
“It’s just Facebook,” many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation’s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the management of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and playfully debuting his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor’s side – which is a public forum that is called official and by employees paid with public tax dollars – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people waving the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section of the news program "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea either, when a number of people take a stand on the same issue, they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."
What the governor’s staff described as a “concentrated spam attack” would likely be called “advocacy.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same, that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence protesters.
But that’s exactly what’s happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the era of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers struck at his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like “Juricola,” “Valerius,” “Belisarius,” and “Portius” wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington’s decisions.
Petitions that criticized his stance on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project’s online papers.
But he did not silence her.
Freedom of speech, difference of opinion and discourse are at the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led the Archerfield Links to the finals last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and serves as tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance Club built, and we're seeing it achieve its glory with this event," Rafferty said.
"Players will see this course at its best, it is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job fixing this place.
He is an avid supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It feels really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year are coming back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always cherish."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I’m happy with how it went so far.”
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scotsmen on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Fewer lung cancer deaths from secondhand smoke
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer due to secondhand smoke.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) have come to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he used his own study on this topic from 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to secondhand smoke per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home Connections Turn Out to Be Very Complex
The construction works in Villinger Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e are in full swing and "are somewhat in time", according to the head of the building yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, because there is much hidden in the underground, which is not noted in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hinders construction work, is a major problem for the Stumpp construction team.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and barrier grilles is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road was closed and only the buses were allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were pretty exhausting.
But fortunately, our friend Fritz Matt provided us with cool mineral water,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed with eager, unwashed hands and swallowed.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are soldiers here.
“Nobody dares to walk around the village after 5pm,” she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was taken up in Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public hand-picking in front of the occupation forces.
An existing movement calling for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island.
The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour car ride by rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated iron roofs, which have been converted into various yellow-brown tones by rust.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing these clothes,” Degei says, pointing to her vibrant hand-woven turban, dark shirt, and bright skirt.
“In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, with 28% of people living below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it’s also Indonesia’s gold country.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix’s Freeport McMoran, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papuans, who ensure that Indonesia’s powerful military maintains a stifling presence.
A 2005 New York Times investigation reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua’s tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
“We Will Lose Everything” says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture – rape and electrocution are particularly popular according to another report – and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened as Papua’s resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of the province’s 3.5 million inhabitants is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up.
“The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papuans,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura to work.
"It has cost the native Papuans - the mama-mom [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and rights violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua’s 29 districts – including Paniai – en route to Jakarta’s presidential palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored,” You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low only two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at their tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking were hunting and beating the group with their rifle butts, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football pitch outside the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in a circle and imitating a bird song - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the mood heated up, the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio: “If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead,” according to an official document from TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, a lot of shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said John, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the Time in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him."
Papua police chief inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to “secure” her station because it was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papuan police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
“It’s about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings did not come to Jakarta until the following day.
For three weeks Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical grievances in Papua.
“I want this case to be resolved immediately so it won’t happen again in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
“Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be gone through," he said.
Then Wiranto retreated when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “everything is regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has indicted for “crimes against humanity” that claimed more than 1,000 lives in East Timor’s bloody independence vote in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there's been no progress at all," says John.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
“I’m scared,” he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
“After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me,” he says.
The shootings did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai's Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested outside the company’s site office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we're afraid there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was a witness to how the injured were quickly admitted here, according to TIME.
"I hid in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the participating officers to be held to account and for the mobile brigade of police to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, in recent years, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody under the pretext of “securing national sovereignty.”
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The amount of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is also out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: especially nuts and fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities have grown between native Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
“The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi’s campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report on Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to Papua’s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group’s allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: “In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases.”
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and pressed him "We want freedom", according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, view their vote for Jokowi as a "guilt" he must pay back.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site right opposite the police and military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they don’t let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fires Capture Dubai's 'Torch' Skyscraper for Second Time
A fire broke out in one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-meter-high, 79-story building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise building in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection authorities said firefighting units extinguished the fire around 4 a.m. local time (0:00 a.m. GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it is working to provide accommodation for those affected.
The incident may resurrect questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding to decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police said they believe the system of panels for insulation and cladding at London’s Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Continued Best-of-Five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has failed with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the session in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning sets was hardly supported by the necessary two-thirds majority.
The five-sentence classics, which are often very long, but also very much appreciated for this reason, are therefore preserved in the traditional competition.
63.54% of the member countries voted in favour of the reform, the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was therefore narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions," Haggerty said.
We will continue to work on improving the applications.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the final at a neutral place had not even come to the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: The finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the hosting right in the first round the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places, etc. will be facilitated and players will have to complete fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers put banned items on the plane, a survey finds
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent knowingly or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who boarded the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent said they had been late discovering that they had been traveling with firearms, ammunition or explosives in error.
The survey of more than 1,000 people — conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. — also found that younger travelers were more likely to disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through security, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs onto the plane.
The company said it had surveyed travelers across the country to find out how many had accidentally smuggled contraband through airport security and how many had done so intentionally.
It’s no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband — knowingly or unknowingly — through safety were the ones who fly the most.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of them.
So it’s no surprise that the largest amount of the items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA might consider books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk: Tens of Thousands of Tesla Customers Cancel Order
Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
In doing so, he has so far concealed the fact that a part of the customers has already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet a different, less glamorous number: those of the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
Musk had frequently advertised the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car in recent months, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Musk now admits that 63,000 of the 518,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will fully refund the 1000 euros (in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation deposit".
Currently, there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla CEO does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders so far could be a problem.
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 – all models taken together – it should be 500,000, in 2020 a million.
The demand for it is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new, never-before-tested production lines with maximum utilization without major interruptions.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can not prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt resigns over delaying Obama-era rules to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, retracted his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit that had been brought against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
It is about a deadline that expired on October 1st for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid “interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth.”
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma State Attorney before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries oppose.
Wednesday’s sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when trying to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turnaround on ozone standards simply reinforces the EPA’s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
“Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others, and in an agreement set the deadline for implementation,” said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We don't believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that it gives us seriously."
Nevertheless, the EPA’s opinion stated that at some point Pruitt will use his “power to delay and all other legally available powers” to ensure that the regulations are “based on sound policies and the best available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
“The reversal of the EPA — after our lawsuits — is a major benefit to the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog pouring into their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered over Pruitt’s surprising change of course.
"It's worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological crusade to target polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilary's Church
750 years of St. Hilary's Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4.30 pm.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and patrons of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes, "It's a unique village gem".
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergisches Urkundenbuch: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Master Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.
According to the text of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a manorial court on the Tumlinger Berg, to which the church or the right of patronage belonged and not vice versa.
There were people living there too.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, the "mountain" was the third, the stately settlement core of the village, next to the lower village and the upper village, which are still visible today in the village of Tumlingen.
Old maps from around the year 1600 support these historical facts.
The right of patronage arose from early medieval ecclesiastical law.
A gentleman who built, furnished and occupied a church with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
This was connected with the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two burst at Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the window panes were smashed and the bell cables stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilarius church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half of it collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower gnome, which still exists today, was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Rentnern" as successors to Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius facility.
On Sunday, 16 July, the Friends and Patrons of Tumlingen invite you to the sixth Serenade at the old cemetery to St. Hilarius Chapel.
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann gives the final word.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 pm.
At the end of the serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers emphasize the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines checked
"Boisheim resists" sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the district council.
The association "Boisheim wehrt sich" has asked district administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was done unlawfully.
The association argues that no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette, since at that time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "battery" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a few days earlier by a change of the land use plan a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - which, however, had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf, due to a form error.
"Due to the lack of planning law requirements, the issued approval notice is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim resists".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council has once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "At this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded under planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the district of Viersen since last week," said a spokesman.
The circle takes it as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are unlikely to result in the process being stopped.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the district on Thursday did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim wehrt sich".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area on Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had already concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare site.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11,400 households is to be met - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all households in Viersen.
New Re plans to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen’s city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in <0xC3><0x9C>bach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash together: woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10 am on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
One woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The state road was closed for hours.
According to police information, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich drove with her car as part of the accompanied driving with her 53-year-old mother as an accompanying person the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and retailers plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city center in September.
The business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to entice the residents to go shopping in the city center.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend should sensitize customers to what offers the own city offers away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market, is therefore planned.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city center should invite you to "midnight shopping".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the closer region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Thus, the trade association and the city are moving into another stage of the "Attractive Downtown" project.
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the Brunnenfest including Sunday open for sale, talks with all tradesmen and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be new or re-developed.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city center when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to enlivening the city center - including landlords, the businesses of the entire city and associations.
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network, which had partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities will participate in the third "home shopping" day nationwide for the first time.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities," said Streich.
The action, led by the Chamber of Industry and Commerce and with many partners, also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her own immediate environment with his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others injured, some of them seriously.
According to the fire brigade, on Wednesday (local time) was still an injured in critical condition.
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A missing person was also later recovered.
The dead were school employees.
As a cause of the accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pressured Mexico over border wall payment after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by The Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president insulted him for publicly denouncing the wall and reportedly told him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the US southern border, vowing to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that taking over trade for the U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia was “ridiculous,” “mistake” and “stupid,” and that insisting on the trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a “dad” after proposing a ban on the relocation of refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Resurrect Racist Lynch Act as Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped out to block its way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long pull on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates were in fear.
"We want this n---r Roger!" the man yelled.
“Get him out of the car!”
Screams tore the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene, played on July 22, is just a re-enactment.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience emits very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to mimic the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
“It’s really inconceivable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years — even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.
"It's a stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and is an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want the ending, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A coroner lays a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the double motivation for the Lynch actions has always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to cast their votes for the first time in the summer primary campaign.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farm tenant Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight — ostensibly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor had been in the city that Hester had slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcolm out of jail, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings," an FBI report concludes.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement that was not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence, and covered up the identity of witnesses".
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
“It was a suffrage massacre,” he said.
“They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: ‘If you register and if you vote, then this will happen to you.’
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual reenactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, poignant, and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching, because then we will be confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year’s production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors — a dozen whites and the rest blacks — crowded into a room and listened as Greene kicked off a well-recorded rundown of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
“I feel dirty because I’m not like that,” Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to go back to those times.”
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm yelling at Hester and pressuring him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n---he, get away from my property!"
Rascona returned the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
“What?” asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
“No,” Greene said, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said a--he at the time."
"Yes," one of the other black actors joked.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And this is where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not just because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, gunshots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a funeral gown, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays mourning eulogy "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple have come from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia’s oppressive humidity for nearly eight hours as Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpses.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"You're not really dead," murmurs a little boy, as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw the lynch rope away and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his teammates and then breaks down crying in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
“It’s okay,” one of the women whispers.
“We know it’s not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chats excitedly about reenacting with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words to express the feeling the performance left.
“It’s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you,” she said.
“What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on,” she added, “today it’s just called police shooting.”
In the same room, Tyrone holds Brook's court at his table, eating and recalling civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the show next year.
“The reenactment is inspiring in some ways, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it’s also a moment of learning,” he said.
“It’s like if we don’t learn anything from it, it can happen again.
He who does not study his own history, who does not know his own history, is condemned to repeat it."
"Götterd<0xC3><0xA4>mmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental oeuvre, director Frank Castorf also focuses on a colourfully frivolous production in front of a gigantic, six-storey backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) optionally shows a shabby street corner including the rest of the wall and kebab shop in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it is an open Mercedes oldtimer, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - that runs through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drags a corpse into the trunk in a Hollywood way and gives the rioto clique.
Stephen Milling sings the gloriously nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated with a storm, who bows modestly and forms his hands to Merkel’s ravine.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual casual clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited.
Five years later, he had to let a valid pipe concert pass over him, there were great cheers, in which the isolated "Buh" cry went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in some way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it had also grown an understanding of his point of view.
I have a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
I also worked at the school in the open all day.
What is your experience with it?
Qty: It's a nice, broad spectrum that I see here.
I deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, a late-term volunteer.
How did that happen?
Q: I graduated high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let’s say, successfully aborted.
I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing?
Do a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it really is on site, in the focal point maybe also, really is.
And was it so?
Qty: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social work in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker training at the Jugendamt Herne and study in Hamm at the Fachhochschule.
Isn’t it a bit unusual to have several different locations during volunteer service?
Qty: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement homes to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work.
For me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing to do that irritated me.
I was able to see my own strengths and see how things really went.
Different than in civil engineering studies?
Q: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of your head, who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, or a teenager who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of contact?
Q: I'm not the type for that.
It’s an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are negative moments, but that’s life.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring programme is launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The job cuts, which Director General John Fallon announced mostly for late 2018 and early 2019, come in addition to his previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
In a third cost-cutting program in May, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by an additional <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its shareholding in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after it posted a 1 percent increase to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last act of violence that hit Afghanistan this month – on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion happened Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a “person-worn improvised explosive device.”
The statement says that all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country’s deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs in on increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration, requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push ahead with the so-called “Ozone Regulations 2015” and said it showed the agency’s commitment to cooperate with states.
“We believe in dialogue with and responding to our state partners,” EPO chief executive Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA’s intention to delay ozone regulations – which aim to measure pollutant emissions in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards – by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed suit on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has sought to reduce a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
However, the effort has triggered the backlash of Democrats and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA’s website says inhaling air containing ozone can “reduce lung function and amplify respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
City council wants community space
In the end, the decision was clear: With two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a community room in the future senior citizens’ housing complex.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take some time until the area previously belonging to the church community is owned by the municipality, there is now no longer any planning obstacle for the project to be carried out by a private investor.
For this, there is a discussion about a common room.
One of the two investors, who are still in the boat, has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor he would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council intend to provide such a common room not as a meeting place only for the residents of senior-friendly housing, but openly into the municipality.
As an example, the word from the "Strickcafé" made the rounds.
The decision, which was taken last autumn by the allocation of funds to the current budget, will be sweetened by funding opportunities.
The construction is located in the redevelopment area.
According to Tjaden, setting up a community space would be eligible at 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposed decision, in order to signal to the investor that in this respect they do not want to throw a club between his legs, provides for the finding that both saddle roofs - which are based on the surrounding buildings - and pulley roofs - which reduce the eaves height and make the construction more economical - would be possible.
Needless, not only Wilfried Sohmer means, is this addition.
If it helps: He passes the panel unanimously.
It is not so easy in the common room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings, with which one does not quite get ahead, but one now leans out of the window at the common room, she says: "I'm having a hard time with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common space - but absolutely against communal participation.
It sees behind this a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
That is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area one does not give a subsidy, but gets a real, in case of doubt marketable equivalent, is the counter-speech.
Staiger’s request to split the proposed decision accordingly finds three supporters.
So it remains with two votes against the original program, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we make the decision in this way, we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: biker is thrown on the road
While crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car on Wednesday in Garath and seriously injured.
As the police announced, the 82-year-old Langenfelder at 12.20 clock with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwarzer Weg coming from Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove onto the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the oncoming traffic.
He collided with a car driving a 66-year-old Hildenerin.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital in a rescue car.
FC Bayern Munich must do without David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game against Dortmund whiz.
FC Bayern travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season with staff worries.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the cup winner.
Before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 a.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at Cup winner Borussia Dortmund, the personal concerns at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti has to do without David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italian on Friday.
In addition, Munich's Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
“We know we’re not in the best physical condition,” Ancelotti said, adding: “The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn’t good in the end.”
The 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The crew is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game".
The duel between the two German heavyweights attracts the fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, announced the German Football League (DFL) on Friday.
Hiking from star to star in the Harz
In the Harz region, the first "Star Trail" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the association Observatory Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the information needs of many Harz visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, exercise and athletic performance.
The members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-accessible installations at five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegei<0xC3><0x9F> and Sieber could be considered.
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet.
That is why good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path is to be extended train by train.
"On the Star Path, viewers learn a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more brightly than another, even though it is much further away.
It also tells you what constellation a selected star is in and when it is best to see it.
The association has been operating the highest located observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy are often clearly visible to the naked eye.
In the university city, there is something similar to the planned Sternenwerg - the Planetenweg - since 2003 on the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (community of equals) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the dwarf planet degraded Pluto at the end point - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun is exactly 75 meters away and measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from the Sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are faster than light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7pm on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klima noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I went up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
Fans demand that.
Let's give it to them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to set a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who is also interested in fighting Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell’s winner after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
“This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for it,” Garcia said, later openly expressing himself to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other name can generate that kind of attention.
Whenever you are ready...”
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter", and he will potentially participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-fight champion from Riverside look "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off".
Garcia said the focus was to show punch strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building for their own struggle.
“This is the fight that needs to be done.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to be working on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I’ve been waiting for the top fighters, and that’s Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injured in tyre crash
In an accident on the A7 motorway, four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30 p.m. shortly before the Marktbreit junction, presumably after a puncture.
The car hurled to the right into the embankment, where it skipped over and then remained lying on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured in the accident.
During the first care of the injured by the emergency service, the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour, then traffic on the left lane could be guided past the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Tricycle works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 to the season opener against Braunschweig, that the optimization of the defense formation in Aue brings points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, and with the result as well, if it had not been for the two goals in the 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"That was two goals too many, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defender.
In the Erzgebirge, the triple chain is also to be further optimized.
And a goal after a free-kick the Fortunes don’t want to catch themselves anymore.
"For the future, it will be that no one will stand on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can cope better with the triple chain even after the experience in the preparation than with the four-chain.
"I don't know yet how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his case, "because we have players in the triples at the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gie<0xC3><0x9F>elmann who can build well," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite is, but that we harmonise even better and that we do not afford so many playback errors in the build."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"Whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw, I don't know.
The performance could be quite okay,” Hoffmann said.
But if we can stand there on Sunday with four points and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper season opener.
His coach didn’t want to know.
“I will only judge the start of the season after six to eight matchdays,” said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be stopped prematurely due to a severe weather.
"Now they can virtually start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they would not have a difficult and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favorite in the bone.
“But they don’t know 100 percent where they are right now,” says Fortuna’s centre-back.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as a light favorite on Sunday to the meeting in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we sweep them away just because we want to be in the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue out of nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," Fortuna's head coach explains.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and presumptuous."
And so Funkel does not want to see his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Agency (R<0xC3><0xA4>ttsmedizinalverket) has started conducting the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they are supposed to make the assessment of the age more precise after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationverket) was criticized for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was “possibly 18 years of age or older.”
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under the age of 18."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
“We don’t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant,” he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, saying that there were 442 cases that “suggest that the person being examined was 18 years of age or older.”
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly said that he would turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are taken, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could," he told Metro.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, you can say that the risk of judging a child incorrectly as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case it’s about 10 percent.”
Full in plan
Work on the three bridges on Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Roads and Transport in the Regional Office of Freiburg.
In April, work began at the same time on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of refurbishment.
The end of construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the schedule will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete arched bridge clad in red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Just like the other two bridges, it has grown over the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three structures are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red colored sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven ton heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is an edge attachment, which is also used as an operating path.
At the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
The pedestrian path will then run on it.
The special thing about this is that they are prefabricated parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach required special sensitivity.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project by handouts in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building yard building and the collection pond in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated single-lane by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully closed.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is 700,000 euros.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colourful protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Linke) belong to a broad alliance, which shows a peaceful flag on this day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the "great election campaign start" according to the poster.
And brings well-known names to the start - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the federal election on 24 September, and the deputy federal chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are there hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD students, but want to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place in the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that offers itself.
And what Christa Karoli, chairwoman of the Forums Eine Welt and one of the leading organizers, is really happy about: "Great, how many people have gathered here".
There is music and a lot of food, including a "original German potato salad, which the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters from the venues.
How did the AfD get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has worked for such an event and has been awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but there got a cancellation, because there were not enough parking spaces because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here".
Looking at the event on the rondelle forecourt, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
It does: Around 8 p.m., a band provides entertainment on the Rondell forecourt, in the Stadthalle various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners who are waiting for the leading candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal chairman Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officers had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests in the forecourt have a longer breath, but there is also a need to clean up shortly after 9 pm.
The police can escape - no special incidents.
Trombone meets trumpet
A re-hearing with the Wolfach trombonist Frederic Belli will take place in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the Klosterkirche.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and laureates of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo trombonist with the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both unite the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds at the two as if in a new guise, Daniel Schnyder's "Weltmusik" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the jazz echo award winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play mix into a fascinating work of art.
This core piece of the program was only this spring premiered with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it to the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything,” says Kristen Stewart quite openly about her bisexuality.
“Once I bite into grilled cheese, I think, ‘Oh, that was cool, what’s next?’”
The most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, which ultimately went bitter apart.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?”
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
It has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously."
According to "Bang Showbiz", she suffered from this in particular, but during her school days, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was 11, the kids told me I was going to look like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, ‘Girl, be proud of yourself!’”
In particular, she does not like to explain her love life to the public: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself in front of the whole public."
The Governor of West Virginia Announces He Will Change the Party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced at a rally with President Trump on Thursday night that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me,” said Gov. Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and many reflections ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a Democratic governor."
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and has inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying, “Governor Justice’s change of party is another blow to a Democratic party that would hinder us rather than work to make our country great again.”
"With only 15 governorships and the control of the fewest legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises 'honest' Russian apology for doping scandal
Worldwide athletics chief Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he described as an overt apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the moment for the country to be reinstated in the sport.
Russia’s athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country’s ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he felt sorry for “all athletes who were snatched away gold and silver medals at competitions.”
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reshaped.”
Coe said he was also “pleased” that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it's been a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We must do everything in our power to normalize this situation in the coming months.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which start in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free to operate, he told reporters in London after a talk at the IAAF Council.
Soldiers killed in Mali
At a funeral in Fritzlar in northern Hesse, around 1,000 people have thought of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
On the still unresolved cause of the crash, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
She described the two dead pilots as "experts in their field".
"We bow to this supreme sacrifice which they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from Northern Hesse had died on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday, accompanied by a death watch of the Bundeswehr, were taken to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter.
At noon, only the family members in the church said goodbye.
Afterwards, the funeral began in the circle of family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hessen’s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Mourning guests laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm to the coffin.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Minister of Defense von der Leyen described the dead soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced deployment.
The chief of staff helped set up the flight operations of the combat helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also declared: "If this crew could not avert the crash, no one would have been able to do it."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen: the operation is dangerous.
But he is also of high importance “for a country from which we are only separated by two states,” she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were taken out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn’t want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the royal family on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn N<0xC3><0xB8>rgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband’s decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
He did not intend to be buried in his native France.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title.
After the accession to the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also took the title "Prince Consort".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not see himself as equal to his wife - not even after death, said Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal family.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he’s worked for over the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, Margrethe met in London in 1965.
He worked at the French Embassy on the Thames.
While his later wife always flew in the expressions of sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik had a difficult state with the Danes in his almost 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik commented on the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitted socks, Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, who I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals in this country, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed.
Those were two mistakes!”
Prime Minister Weil wants quick re-election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green government majority for a quick new election of the state parliament, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday there was a call for the dissolution of parliament.
Previously, the surprise departure of a Green MP from their parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The previous Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her step with the non-nomination for the election 2018 in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said in Hanover on Friday.
CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to include them.
Thus, the CDU and FDP together have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament, the SPD and the Greens 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new state parliament will be regularly elected on 14 January next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil, however, believes that it is essential that the state parliament decides its self-dissolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the state parliament withdraws the confidence of the prime minister and elects a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined in a legally clean manner," said Thümler.
"You will discuss all questions calmly, if they have been examined in a legally reasonable manner."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but something curious".
She said: "I'm not a traitor.
I feel very good".
She described herself as a supporter of black and green.
The Greens called on the renegade MPs to return their state mandate.
"Of course, we assume that it will return with immediate effect its Landtag mandate, which it has received via the green land list," state presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner said.
Green Group leader Anja Piel said: "We deeply regret Elke Twesten's decision".
She deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transition of the Lower Saxon Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
“The behavior of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the voters, but also a betrayal of the red-green,” wrote the Federal head of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the state parliament re-elected quickly.
The exit of Twestens costs Red-Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician "in her hurt vanity and in her frustration put her personal interests before the good of the country," criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty intrigue and is trying to make political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony’s CDU party leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his MPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD parliamentary group leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the result of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD at the time, but the SPD and the Greens had a wafer-thin majority of one vote in the state parliament.
Agriculture Minister in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is talking about contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) will be answering questions in an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to take a close look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp imprint.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of supply - because the central role of the scout is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house immediately turned up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder ever since Germany’s concern became known.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
The trade, like the manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and harmless to health.
If the maximum residue level of 0.005 mg/kg is exceeded for eggs, they are not marketable.
However, unencumbered eggs can be sold and eaten.
This time it's not the companies' fault.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, there is no direct fault on the part of the production companies.
Rather, they face economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service providers.
As always, there are too few inspectors in an emergency.
Is it just lack of staff or also of conclusive competence?
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent.
Precisely for this reason, a consistent clarification of such events and the handing over to the public prosecutor’s offices in cases in which crimes can be present are crucial.
I have repeatedly made it clear that I expect the responsible authorities to provide a complete explanation.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and marketable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
As a result of the spread, manufacturers, traders and consumers have fallen into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This has to be worked on consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and without any gaps.
How Football’s Financial Rules Affect Neymar’s Move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar’s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the leading organization that has overseen the European game has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar’s transfer was funded without any major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen up the money for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must counter with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on enormous debt in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea – buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – would become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini has fallen out of favor with the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to work to discourage excessive spending.
"Certainly, FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer amount for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million euros can be reported in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG was fined €60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014/15 season be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial regulators by inflating their revenues through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company might sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of PSG payments to Neymar could come from payments made by the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG over Neymar’s transfer, the people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015/16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association assumes that the turnover will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and it tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
“It’s a clear case of ‘financial doping’ with the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar’s ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state funding a club.
“It’s the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years,” Wenger said.
“As soon as a country has a club, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you go different ways or you can have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggi supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced on-board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end: the airline reschedules the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report by the newspaper "Northwestern Switzerland" on Friday at the request of the news agency sda.
According to current plans, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products are checked every two to three years and subjected to a quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman.
Around 17 million small red-and-white packed 14-gram chocolate plates are distributed to passengers by flight attendants before landing.
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwestern Switzerland" to be 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs.
But the advertising effect is always more important: For a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate bars on board its flights since 2006.
Before Swiss signed a contract with Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, customers of First Class will be spoiled with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class passengers snack Schoggi from Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey is also distributed on short-haul routes, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Discus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion fights for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup and could only watch the discus competition from the stands.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes to the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This retelling of the story is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (when the thought leaders David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Rud Things went to.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag – middle-aged actors playing horny kids growing up – they still managed to create the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more along the watering can principle, including a riff on the 90s Stalker films such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, a character browses through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates, and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there’s another crazy-malicious plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now backed by George H. W. Bush (a well-made impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursus is the best part of the franchise.
It's a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's under-lipped beard from "Singles", whose former Big Man on Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It’s the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive “Seven Up!” series until it reaches what I take as its logical conclusion: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,” whose final scene will show the gang how they will attend the movie premiere of “Wet Hot American Summer.”
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now recalls a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-Vs-West wrestling iconography.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy with Rhys Thomas as director claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are dubbed into English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers – including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny – makes for a decent game of ‘Find the Voice’.
But “Comrade Detective” is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama—a killer wearing a Reagan mask is included—that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes, it drags on, and the comedy is not fast enough or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", edited to a lesser length, could deliver his agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can turn anything into food for a feast.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with theirs.
Attack on drug mafia in the country
The police succeeded in striking the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor’s office Konstanz announced on Friday.
Fifteen defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and have already been issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officials secured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people have been arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two Italian suspects.
The two will probably be shipped to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, as well as robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor’s office in Konstanz has been investigating organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the public prosecutors’ offices in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of the Rottweil crime syndicate had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia were the main target of the investigations.
An incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also likely to be on the account of the gang.
Weise complains about large gaps in the register of foreigners
"Data of citizens who should not show up": According to a report, the foreigners register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to sometimes serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, Frank-Jürgen Weise, the Federal Government’s Commissioner for Refugee Management, has drawn attention to major gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "partially serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned Weise in an analysis, which is available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
The register includes 10 million people of foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreigners authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register anymore."
"Faulty data entry can significantly slow return processes," the report said.
The statistics on people who are obliged to leave the EU also include EU citizens who do not have to leave the EU.
However, such misallocations led to “a distorted debate about how to deal with those obliged to leave,” according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the German government has apparently begun sending refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy when they arrived from there.
This emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures “with regard to families with children – with the exception of infants and toddlers – to Italy since 1 June 2017”.
Since the end of 2014, this was practically no longer possible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin Convention, refugees are the responsibility of the EU state, which they reach first.
If an immigrant travels to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
As a justification, the office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly."
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, spokeswoman for the left-wing parliamentary group in the Bundestag, criticized this decision: "Families with children are at risk of illegal reception conditions and endangering the child's well-being because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach have already been made available for other people by the blood donation service.
At least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First and foremost Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the municipal council, the community acknowledges the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is brilliant how our bodies are designed for this and we pay respect to donors who provide their blood for strangers, even more disinterestedly," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single donation of blood helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, director of the German Red Cross, because the canned food is broken down into its components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRC's director of preparedness.
Obviously, the move to the theater a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many are accounted for by Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pbrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter each donated ten times 500 milliliters of their life’s juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “slow” as it maintains interest rates on family income amid mounting pressure.
Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members aiming for an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and to 1.6% in 2018, warning that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall.
But she signaled that interest rate hikes would become necessary over the next few years to curb Brexit-fueled inflation, and she said credit costs may need to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding to banks starting next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion more under this system – at <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: “In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real household incomes continues to weigh on consumption.”
On interest rates, she reiterated that “some tightening of monetary policy” would be needed to cool inflation and a “slightly larger” scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
The Bank’s downwardly revised growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecasts for May.
It maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
According to these news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 U.S. dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to make no change comes after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations of an interest rate hike and GDP rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank towards the end of the year.
The most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases, as the tightening gets worse first before it gets better.
She added that monetary policy cannot “prevent” the slump in income over the next few years, but she added that wages will “clearly” rebound by the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also bolstered by rising demand for UK goods, due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after interest rates fell to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to sink.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Before the bank’s last ruling on interest rates, the call for a rate hike had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June last month to 2.6%, although the bank said it was expected to do so and will pick it up again in the coming months.
The bank said the overrun in relation to its target of 2% was “totally” attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders loudly search for deals and end the year in a positive way.
The market is looking particularly good for those who are running out of existing deals and closing new mortgages, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more popular.”
NHS (The National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will have access to “transformative” HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against funding for the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service over an initial three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeals upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the authority to pay for PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move, announced Thursday, was hailed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as an “important new intervention,” while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a “decisive moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be rolled out across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough medications in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or as early as two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and those with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics will identify appropriate participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a GP can also sign up for a possible participation at their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will cost <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is used, incorporated and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and outpace the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of continued progress in addressing one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: “This is a critical moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, resulting in the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority must now be for the study to be conducted quickly across the country and for no one at risk for HIV to be left behind.
Now that PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 HIV-infected people.”
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: “The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This trial brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study be conducted across the country as soon as possible to protect individuals who are HIV-infected, and that it will help bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.”
Living the big life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, narrowed down from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It’s located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace – and it’s a testament to the new design that Joanne didn’t pack and sell her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my request,” she says.
To this end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi’s Duck & Shed architecture and design studio in Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot ceilings to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine floor in which to stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
“The steel plant is quite complicated,” he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bend over.
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform, but of laying the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function at the top or bottom."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms on top of each other at full height - with a lot of additional drama.
For the mezzanine floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space, and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses by Joanne.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen when not in use.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counter-weight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“At the end of the day, you’ll be selling the floor space — or how your property is valued,” says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will step in and perform a calculation based on soil size."
Here they have managed to increase the floor area while at the same time using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home,” says Erfan.
“You don’t fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that an apartment can turn from something standard to something quite amazing through good design and increased square footage.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.
Brothers Fight Over $500 Million Real Estate Empire
Two brothers find themselves in a dispute over one of Victoria’s biggest real estate empires worth over $500 million four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided.
Paul has wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a shop on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis’ portfolio now includes city centre offices, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centres.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court filing says this means Colin owns $316 million in property and Paul owns $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.
“The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects,” he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled him out.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
“My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
Costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family’s first denim store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was “in my final years of high school when Paul was still a little kid (about 10 years old).”
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
“Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the company and Luke was paid $26 million.
Both Lukas and Mark have become “bitter about the terms of their financial separation.”
Colin has been very reserved despite being a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the TV star’s best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by texting to say “I really can’t say much” because the case is in the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother’s demands.
“Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a solution.”
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to limit the president’s media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump — including news media reports — in hopes of keeping the chief on a more even course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior executives on his first day at work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that gets into the hands of the president.
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow — whether on paper or in briefings — because the president would make better decisions if he got good information.
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television stretches back decades — and now that he’s in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
“If candidate Trump was upset about an unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from positions that were too convincing,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico’s Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise.”
Okay, okay, okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we others don’t—that Trump’s tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions.
We’ll probably never know about the tweets Trump didn’t send.
If his employees have managed to keep him away from trouble several times, then their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that might further their views of the world.
Politico - fully concerned with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he’s committed to finding out where they came from.
That’s exactly what happened in late February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being “the source behind a bunch of leaks” at the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that he has made false allegations in the past and retracted them.
Trump read the article and began questioning employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary-General Rob Porter “tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives.”
How'd that work out?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still aspire to influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
This summer, police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the wanted criminals are naturally not known, hints from the population are hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday about the action, which follows the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar of the winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding at holiday destinations, Europol said.
21 postcards were put together for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
So far, 36 of the online searches have been arrested, at least 11 of them due to information after publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'Millionaires' series
Some of the West Midlands’ most affluent homeowners are back at war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a moat drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the "Millionaires' Row."
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after being ejected only in May, but without being deterred by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have been harassing the council of Solihull, who said it was “useless to deal with the problem.”
An anonymous resident said: “They moved there on Monday night after being sent on by Bentley Heath where they threw stones at passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back again.
More arrived last night, probably even more today."
She added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long briefings to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my community tax if the council can't even stop that."
A local resident who didn’t want to be named said, “It’s ridiculous, we’ve just seen the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area."
A spokeswoman for the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihull Police, taking the necessary legal action to get them moving as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must consider when we present our case."
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to reopen on March 1 next year.
This is good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective accommodation in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial at the time.
But above all, the Lord Mayor of Freudenstadt, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and even then spoke of serious interested parties at the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with its managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a three-star plus hotel again under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction waste containers have been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do until March.
“It’s actually a nice hotel,” says Thomas Scherer in an interview with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautiful close to the citizens", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
Swimming pool, spa and meeting room are among the amenities available.
One does not want to position oneself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale city center level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to position itself broadly, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The ideas of the city are congruent with those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise.
Just under a million dollars, he said.
The outdoor facilities are also being brought into line, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace is created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
U.S. Special Investigators Set Up Grand Jury
In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, according to a report, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury.
The panel had started work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper said the move was a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that there were already initial subpoenas from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were any collusions between Trump’s campaign and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisers to the Republican in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also increasingly scrutinized Trump’s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that special counsel Trump had personally moved to the center, investigating the accusation that the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine available evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to bring charges.
Grand juries are therefore also called prosecution chambers.
In most cases, they are turned on when larger and controversial cases are involved.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The panel can also be called on by the public prosecutor’s office to summon people for questioning under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Persons involved in the meeting were asked to testify, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign manager Paul Manafort were also present at the conversation.
Legal experts said Thursday evening on U.S. television that the deployment showed that Mueller was not intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it does not necessarily have to mean that the grand jury will be called in at the end to decide on the filing of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“Russia’s history is a total invention,” Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to “feel good because they don’t have anything else to talk about.”
His special adviser Ty Cobb said in a statement that he did not know about the setting up of a grand jury.
They usually work in secret, he said.
The White House is in favor of any measures that would expedite the Special Counsel’s work in a “fair” manner.
Former FBI Director James Comey has said three times that the president will not be investigated.
There is no reason to believe that anything has changed, the statement said.
Mueller was fired after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this expulsion, accusations against Trump had become loud, he had wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey testified before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation of then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under a lot of pressure because of the investigation.
According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special counsel and his associates.
That sparked speculation as to whether Trump would release Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special counsel, such as in the Watergate affair involving later-retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the urging of the president by the Department of Justice.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bills Thursday that would make it difficult for the special counsel to be dismissed.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drifts in Antarctica
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has broken away from the shelf ice.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs more than a trillion tons and measures 5,800 square kilometres, is now drifting northwards and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
There is no danger to people from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
In total, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now-broken colossus was previously part of the Larsen-C ice shelf.
Shelf ice floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It therefore grows further and further into the sea and breaks off regularly.
The Larsen C Ice Shelf lies south of South America at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this shelf ice, the balance of waxing and breaking off was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete ice shelf had disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen C ice shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it currently is.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks off at a key point.
Melting shelf ice and iceberg does not raise sea level, as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it produces after melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can flow off much faster than before.
This could possibly raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica, at nearly 50,000 square kilometres, according to AWI data.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the leading edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks down there regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now coming into a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University.
"This is the furthest withdrawal since records began," he said.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen C ice shelf will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades many ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated.
This long tip of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula’s ice area has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature rises the fastest.
CDU wants house tariff on staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is demanding to leave the employers’ association in order to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break, the district council waved through 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teaching positions at the circle are obviously very much in demand.
Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks personnel in order to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
Currently, there are 50 unfilled positions in the Mettmann district.
Doctors and engineers as well as forces of the general administration are being sought.
The CDU would now like to take the initiative in the Kreistag together with the FDP and the UWG and counteract the lack of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration should "develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but also to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented manner.
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented, show concrete measures for lateral entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
This sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a real "competition of public employers".
In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is high time to act so that more jobs are not left unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU faction, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a fist-thick surprise in the district council, when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cap and amazed the other parties.
Völker would like to see all possibilities that make it possible to leave the local employers’ association.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should work with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities - to reach a house tariff," said Völker.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and civil servants better than the public service tariff regulations actually provide.
Salaries are currently exactly prescribed, there are increases or more money only if you change to a higher level, which is based on professional years.
However, the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitute protection law.
Not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, district administrator Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: They have too few staff.
Italy tightens the tone of NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs deploying lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they may not continue if they do not abide by new rules for their operations.
“If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin-based daily La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat belonging to German aid organization 'Jugend Rettet' because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations made by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess any allegations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that its crew is taking on board dinghy migrants delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor’s file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the authority of the Italian Coast Guard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring “substantial changes or impediments” to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and work with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Rises and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
This was followed by viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could see far over the Palatinate Forest and the plains in front.
In between, there were always longer climbs for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Once again, the vantage point was lined up at the vantage point, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days, many altitude meters were announced again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refreshment huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing brine in the open-air inhalation.
Neustadt was also targeted.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4,500 metres in altitude, the group had come to know the Palatinate Forest at its best - both in terms of sport and culture.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga gears up for E-Sports
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of sweating their way through the stadium turf in wind and weather?
The fact is that e-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business – including big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high salaries.
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
The start was made in 2015 by VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire completely new target groups for VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "there are still a number of clubs rising on this train".
This coming weekend, the FIFA World Football Association in London organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup", in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be present online in these markets much more often than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is it all about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are fought on a competitive level.
Leagues have long been established, as in normal sports, in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, eSports is already part of the official programme.
Is it really a proper sport?
For many, the idea is certainly in need of getting used to.
Ingo Froböse also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that you can also find in classic sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue".
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are traveling internationally, this is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.
Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga, that is little.
However, the e-sports "is not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultants.
Internationally, many countries are already further along.
Major markets are Asia and the USA, where former basketball player Shaquille O’Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in eSports betting company Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports was introduced as a subject of instruction, says Froböse.
According to Dutt, in the Netherlands and France, football first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In a European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
To fall into nostalgia and to shine a light on the old days is no longer enough.
It is a matter of preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
“We live in a digitalized world,” says Dutt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only in football everything stays the way it always was."
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal over eggs contaminated with poison.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and have removed all eggs from sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown not to contain fipronil should be placed on the shelves.
Michelle Carter Sentenced for Texts Urging Conrad Roy to Suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months behind bars and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at the hearing on Thursday, “My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal was made.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and eyes down when she was convicted.
"Their actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She has no responsibility,” she said.
"She has shown no remorse".
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “terrible circumstance that she deeply regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he had not found that "their age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy, saying that there is “no day when I don’t mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I handle everything, and I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain we will carry with us for eternity.”
Roy’s sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was “persecuted” by the realization that she would never attend her brother’s wedding or be an aunt to his children.
“Not having this one person I’ve been with every day since I was born is a pain I’ll always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter’s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
“Hang up, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don’t know there are many ways,” she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, “You have to do it, Conrad” and “All you have to do is turn on the generator and you’ll be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case through some press.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lame of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
The FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not hurt.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich immediately saw, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But since on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer could be seen, he made up his arms.
“The coach didn’t announce it,” said the Confed Cup winner afterwards, after his first assignment as Bayern captain.
Well, the debut could have gone better than in the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also interpret Kimmich like this.
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who had been chosen as the leader of the C-Eleven, consisting of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come out of the holidays, but he.
Zuckerl is best distributed to those you trust a lot, who you want to keep in a good mood.
So those who have been chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flashed across the field as a mini-lame.
Right back, that's his position now, the white bandage on the arm did the rest.
And in this starting formation Kimmich looked like the one who can best take the helm.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unplayed force.
He had the eye for the whole, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal to cover up his lack of fitness (hardly folded); Renato Sanches to tie in with the achievements of the Asia trip (also folded only to a limited extent); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle not to stand out negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern shirt.
That worked quite well, after all.
Süle ran up next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acting sovereignly.
The famous Napoli storm often proved difficult, and Süle also tried to build up the game successfully a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "wasn't what we had hoped for".
But he also showed a decent performance in the debut.
Game transfer, tempo change: "I was also brought for this style".
How unusual this Bayern world is for the new arrivals, you saw after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but certainly six or seven.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game.”
After all, he no longer has to teach the new one.
Alaba motivates <0xC3><0x96>FB women
David Alaba believes in the success of our <0xC3><0x96>FB-Ladies
Austria’s best-known footballer has reported on Twitter shortly before the match and wishes the <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies all the best.
The Bayern-Legion<0xC3><0xA4>r is almost a club colleague of <0xC3><0x96>FB-Captain Schnaderbeck and is excited with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian Footballer of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational shot.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bayern-Dusel.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Wissing's economy praises pace
The relationship between the state and the regional economy was often irreconcilable when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still the Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing is picking up on the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked".
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: The gap closure of highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s list of priorities.
This year, the Ministry hopes for a planning approval procedure, and construction law is to be in place by 2021.
A role in the plans of the state also plays the west bypass Trier, which is in the urgent need of the federal traffic route plan.
The aim is to put the line into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a guide to supporting regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, strives for a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports, which have been declining for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new Master Bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is planned for the passed master’s examination and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years after the master’s training.
However, the homework list for the country remains long.
With the planned road construction, facts can be quickly created, but at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, CEO of the Trier Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Of the 56 new engineers Wissing wants to hire for mobility at the state company, only 29 have been filled so far.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, vice-president of the CDU, refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, which in 2017 and 2018 invested more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of state roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country, how it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The current broadband expansion in the country is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies rated the network supply only with a score of 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained about a slowing internet connection and aborts.
Former Minister of Economy Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Greens left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where they already cleared the field after four months due to disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles – car manufacturers face a backlash
A day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes “there are smarter options than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is based – to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a recall.
European carmakers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automakers to install plants to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddled the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices to comply with regulations when a car has been tested, but drive back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees of Volkswagen have been charged, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi’s engine development was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could put a heavy strain on Volkswagen: The luxury automobile manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen’s profits.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that the Isar visitors also participate, tomorrow Saturday a raft will sail through Munich, which has a special message.
If you visit the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a usual raft, with Isar tourists.
But the construction department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ..." the understanding for the Isar as a protected wild river should sharpen.
Already last summer the raft crossed the Isar and again this year there are more actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's nostrils and the laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at one time one of the most published cartoon artists, the tuber noses of his characters are his trademark.
Even at the age of 85, the Argentinian still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laughter, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants.
In his early years as an artist, he worked as a draftsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
“The happiest day of my professional life was the day I lost my job,” he once said.
After working in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough in the late 1960s with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, T-shirts, plush toys and watches, his quirky characters continue to find a lot of circulation worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on an animated film and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a centipede as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is to be released on the cinema screen in 2019.
“I don’t know exactly what they’re going to say, it’s weird for me,” Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
Therefore, he relies more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil attracts not only holidaymakers, it is also in high demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped ones and either missing or weakened ones.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
Among the solutions considered are better water distribution and the slowing of evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Merchants, guilds, merchants, vagrants or a Landsknecht camp are to be experienced on these days in the city center.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa caused by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: take their children into the office, who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as the bodies pile up across the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is its editor and inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared issues, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are heartbroken and though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting has little use for discussing security, Ibarra says.
“It’s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop,” he says.
"As long as we don't know the why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which translates as "Twelfth River".
The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum here.
It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot in the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, which are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Despite this, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the guilt of not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman’s sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought up every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to form Riodoce and sold $50 holdings.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for brave and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting research without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she was awarded the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for her coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in tracking Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa “is a way of life,” he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"You have to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.
I don’t want to be asked, “What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn’t you say what was going on?”
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the joker who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
He trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across the street from the office, and sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his ruin?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job while staying alive.
“You don’t like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways” to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, Riodoce’s editor Andres Villarreal said that “smell is a sense that can be fooled...and then the thing happened to Javier.”
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa – just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, cell phones were suddenly not allowed. Days earlier, it was announced that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40°C) in the shade of a tree.
They were tasked by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-joking, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week’s issue, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending that focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor’s office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it came time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
One reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels for almost the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at the venue, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers had seen the Valdez column as the most informed source on the abduction.
“Before, we would have known what happened,” said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed “El Flaco” because of his slender body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the killings of journalists because employees have become something they never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist at the prosecutor’s office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal in writing down "SOS Press" in organized protests on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked that she be reclassified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were “surrounded” by organized crime, government officials involved, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who have been at odds with organized crime.
The media watchdog group “Articulo 19” last year assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials.
“In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up,” Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Ciudad Juarez Diario publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page titled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It’s hard to find work in exile, and they’re still watching the streets looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as appears to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was finished, Riodoce’s editors were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office drinking beer as all of a sudden their phones began buzzing.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.
From the curb they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the policemen who were keeping watch to see if they were on standby.
If they were afraid at all, they didn’t show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the streets for reporting."
Dinosaurs Used Camouflage to Avoid Their Enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Now, researchers have found that the initial findings of a Canadian miner’s incredible rhino were so well received that experts have described it as the “Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.”
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown — and they said she had had something of a “troubled past.”
The report in the journal Current Biology described him as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the mid Cretaceous between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved state has baffled researchers who describe it as "really remarkable."
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk while he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He encountered something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100-kg) clump of earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you just blink a little with your eyes, you might almost believe it was asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that although covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, this herbivore was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the countershading, a common method of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the creature's top was darker than its bottom.
Although counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that employ countershading—think deer, zebra, or armadillo—are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur has been subjected to a real struggle for survival.
“Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaur predators must have been,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur’s skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but it is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the animal's original shape," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just squint a little with your eyes, you might almost believe he's asleep."
The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank into the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk while he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from snout to hip.
The creatures averaged about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips protruding from its shoulders.
The researchers believe the armored herbivore was swept through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved his armor in exquisite detail.
The petrified remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right forefoot is at his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole.'
In the thunderstorm: Mass car jamming on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car crash.
There are numerous injured, miles of traffic jams - and gaffers.
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass car bomb attack late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, around 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen junctions (district of Aichach-Friedberg) almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, crashed into each other during a thunderstorm.
The exact number of injured was not initially available.
These are minor to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backwater of around ten kilometres was formed.
As one AZ reporter reports, massive obstructions also occurred on the opposite lane - due to numerous gaffers.
The fire brigade noted the license plates of the vehicle drivers, who now have to expect sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It’s a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: you don’t know anything, you’re on the train and you’re asleep.
Or you are absorbed in your work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then: puff.
Comes the conductor and wakes a rude or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the days of interruptions will soon be over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the unscaffolded ticket control.
You simply confirm via mobile that you have taken your place and invalidate the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
“When the offer comes, we expand it.
It is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany," said a railway spokesman.
"Comfort check-in" is what the train calls the ticket devaluation without conductor.
To be able to use them, however, some requirements must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which most passengers already do anyway.
You must also have bought it via the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient way to book a ticket anyway.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call your ticket under "My tickets".
The test customers then see a button for electronic validation.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant comes to seat Y during ticket control, he knows that a passenger with an online ticket that has already been devalued is sitting there.
So you can keep sleeping, keep working, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendants, simply check in to the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to personalise their travel time on the train,” says Michael Peterson, Member of the Board of Management of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often travel by train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travelers, not all documents that you need for the devaluation of online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or other document that you have to present is missing.
The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and the passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in the control of your own ticket and the conductor takes the time to take care of other concerns at the end.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just one day after arriving in New York City, the St. Louis-born sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone in high school.
“Police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it’s still on the street,” the statement said.
Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle <0x40>TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was about to tweet live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
“That’s wild,” Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She dropped her cell phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield drive later that evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father wearing a sign that said, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman unsecured his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
"That's not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder that we're used to and that we can call typical."
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father’s house and decided that the two would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in cinemas starting in the 11th century.
It is a history of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before that morning “about the black experience and the black state.”
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she recalled what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them with me," Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a culmination of ... what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well-developed, not only to know activism and organization, but also to know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to become free in order to liberate ourselves.
Even though I’m lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn’t personally experience blatant racism, she’s no different than the next black woman kid.
I feel like I'm doing her a disservice to keep her away from it."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site opposite the police station that became a camp area as the activists waited for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter teamed up with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
“My activism changed completely after August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to “document” what happened.
A question came to Ferrell’s mind: “Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?”
This skepticism has been fueled by countless cases of people, often whites, in a community that has benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn't center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This documentary isn't someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. We're talking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a Messiah leader, but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the film's most open participant.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" reveal surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
“But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who coined the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 identify themselves as gay.
“Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole,” Ferrell said, “and that’s why we’re constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the brunt of everything."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is really being upheld by black women and many black women."
She insists, however, that “this is not an affirmative type of action,” in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
“She was the person who stirred up that energy,” she said.
"It's no coincidence, though she was at the forefront, because there's so much at stake in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is on probation for 21<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From "Dream" to "Grö<0xC3><0x9F>enwahn": TV readers discuss Bit-Gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people even though it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since its first presentation in 2009.
The cold leaves hardly any.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some people say to the Bit-Gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), the other side says: "Don't need a human being" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Grö<0xC3><0x9F>enwahn!" (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the Bauernmarkthalle is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
At the beginning of the construction work, this will be over.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - namely to the Bede square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping in the Bauernmarkthalle almost weekly for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women again and again very much like.
We also discovered the butcher shop for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, too, there are.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent.
It’s not likely to be very low in the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There is enough of that in our city.
You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.
But since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least maintain the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not acceptable for a retailer.
Unfortunately, there are almost no more specialty shops and what is left of them will probably also disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the Bauernmarkthalle go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the Ghost Bit gallery manage to evict all businesses from Bitburg before that?"
George Marquet: “This just won’t work.
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery.
But there is no room for a farmer's market hall thanks to the insanely many - I think - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the Farmers' Market Hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
Related: Artist Creates Portraits with Chelsea Manning’s DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which look almost imperceptibly alike - hanging from the ceiling on cables.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek dabs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the snippets from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year sentence after she made public classified diplomatic messages via the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and from which 30 portraits were created of what someone with these genomic data might look like, has created a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data—the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations—but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six espionage law violations, computer fraud, and theft.
Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only a single photo—a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning was visibly uncomfortable sitting in a driver’s seat wearing a platinum-blonde wig—with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came out of the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the trash to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They did an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg told a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn’t visit at the time and she couldn’t be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal pen pals who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President would transform Chelsea’s judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning’s release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison just days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.
There is also something deep and powerful about the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that “things happen for a certain reason.”
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is heart-shaped), called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist’s sophisticated scientific lexicon) to show how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
“What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn’t care about who we are and how open genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective they are,” said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, can also be seen.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that’s 30 of those stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the comic novella mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she emerges from the disciplinary barracks of the United States such as King-Kong with a hands-free phone in her hand.
“If they chill your speech, then they’ve won,” it says.
“Never keep your mouth shut.”
“It came straight from a letter she wrote to me,” said the artist, who hails from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she should, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacra, which flock together like hordes of protesters.
This was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to size (5" 2, Manning's stature), where her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
“In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits said.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind their liberation.”
Professor of Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee wanted for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of the Cook County District Court show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stings.
A community warning system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stabbings as murder, while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem had now been placed on leave and barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an email statement that “we are in touch with the police in the UK and are ready to help U.S. investigators in any way imaginable.”
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to confront the authorities.
“The police have an idea of where they are, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip that said something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza’s management team released a statement to residents: “Police are currently working on the victim’s timeline and background, exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the World Anti-Doping Agency’s (WADA) remaining criteria for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the Roadmap criteria, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA timetable has been updated in this respect,” Mutko said.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA’s Roadmap to Compliance, which outlines the criteria for reinstating RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has acknowledged an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we are not going to admit something that doesn't exist."
Mutko’s words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia’s independent anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russian outlet RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
In November 2015, as a result of the doping scandal, RUSADA was excluded from conducting doping controls in Russia by WADA.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
Following a visit to the organization’s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving “in the right direction” to be reinstated.
Aldi no longer sells eggs for the time being
This was shared by the company groups.
It is a purely precautionary measure, it can be assumed no further health impairment, it said in the communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have been tested negative for fipronil-containing anti-lice agent.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The Start-Ups That Will Help Your Business Not Become the Next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness with your employees at your e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or – worse – fraudulent.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
“There was just never consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She called people from the outside for help.
A new breed of human resources startups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employee anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-suite executives and contact the board directly.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what her employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval scores – so you can re-drill why.
Companies come to realize that you need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so you don’t become the next Uber implicated in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to financial tech website Let’s Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw rising interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber fall into disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized “pulse” surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Executive Officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The court of public opinion has caught the regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to be mistreating its employees or behaving unethically, it may experience costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee fluctuation, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, issues that were previously hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states—such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices—can be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of the experience with employment,” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the “social media came to their right” that companies realized they couldn’t prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have both supported start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising all of the capital to $47 million.
Glitter secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments come as no surprise, given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
“If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making that company successful,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are doing well. Companies are doing well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and employee engagement, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn’t come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
“If you’re asking for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be willing to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too heavily on data collection.
“Because if you don’t follow, employees will ask themselves, ‘Did you really hear me?
Will you take care of it?
And who you don't care about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, Errett said.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is constantly gaining new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better employee retention in an industry known for high sales.
“If you’re not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you’re going to lose people,” Vitrano said.
“If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It’s getting to 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players are talking on one side of the team’s new practice fields on campus.
Some have taken off their jersey tops and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour practice before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
“This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days,” said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease players’ load, and it has actually extended their days — at least until Friday’s final.
Therefore, UCLA’s first three training sessions should begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players’ already jam-packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than one day on which the Bruins postponed the start of camp almost a week after last season and, during summer school, performed hands-on practice for the first time during Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practice sessions over the course of August, 20 prior to the start of formal game preparations for their opening match against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule change, even as it adds another point to players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
“And they just pushed it through, they keep patching up, they’re great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it’s going to be really great.”
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with soccer balls that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora conceded that there could be a problem once those rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
“That’s a real problem, and it’s not far-fetched to think people rent a room there and then get ready to record an exercise there.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it’s a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan.”
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to third-party fact-checkers and then display their results below the original post, the world’s largest online social network said on Thursday. It’s one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false positives and send them to fact-checkers who may view fact-checking results from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many believe also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supporting a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful posts as they did before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to realizing what stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share,” Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the “related article” and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his more recent past, the little Scotney Castle featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy home in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mopharious Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
“I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years,” he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It’s not the first book by Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote ‘Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories’ in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library – a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
“I just responded to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins,” he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were there himself.
“I love the archives.”
For someone so battered with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I've overrated my welcome a little") this all seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle, talking to landscapers, gardeners, and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust did not gain full access until 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees were just starting to take care of the archive, which he described as “hundreds of years of aristocrats saying, ‘Oh, throw it in the attic.’
Diaries, letters from the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: “You might think that land conflicts would be boring,” Rhodes says, “but there was a birch tree that two families fought for.
Guys, let it all go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of an uproar that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two of them are connected?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle – such as ‘The Priest’, which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is portrayed, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was unearthed).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, always in debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women – I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to promote incest.”
After the end of his engagement in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>nm<0xC3><0xA4>ki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the fucking life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf veiled
With the concealment of the 301-year-old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand (Thursday’s round-up).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
Or?", ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their website, which was released yesterday.
"But we're using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we firmly believe that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The campaign is about more than “just” a logo and a slogan.
"It is important to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable uniqueness".
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a mid-five-digit amount for its new umbrella brand and campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So too this week.
At first glance, this is a normal process.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff, as in the past, but at the Prime Minister’s office.
The five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions, chaired by the Prime Minister.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in the majority.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the Army, Air Force and Navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army – mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
486 people, who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt, are being negotiated in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had already described the coup attempt as a "gift of God" because he gave him the opportunity to "completely cleanse the armed forces."
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Uncomfort in the military headquarters".
In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The big clean-up of the army and the security forces continues anyway.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered the firing of a further 7,395 civil servants, including 2,303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals were formerly considered the real masters of the country.
Three times, they put up a coup, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his electoral victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least citing the reform requirements of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately pushing for the Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer, who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is the case, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, there are doubts in the alliance after the purges about the readiness of the Turkish army to deploy.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are “weakened,” NATO diplomats say.
Washington Changes the Rules of the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It plans to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tougher regulations on obtaining visas for temporary work permits, and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and endorsed by the president.
The bill is to be debated in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the U.S. is spending green cards on citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to refurbish track for Rennsteigshuttle
Over the past few months, the future of the Rennsteig shuttle has been at odds again and again – now it should be done very quickly.
Before the end of the year, construction is to be carried out on the dilapidated route on which the tourist train runs.
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteig shuttle in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the route will begin this year.
"With the decision to continue to order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is particularly important for tourism," said Klaus Sühl, Secretary of State for Transport, in Erfurt on Friday.
He estimated the costs for the repair of the line to be about 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country will take over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently finalized, Sühl explained.
The Ministry and the South Thuringian Railway as operators are already in agreement on the technical details.
"This means that the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated," Sühl said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the Rennsteig shuttle will be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a railway connection between the stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig, which is especially popular with tourists.
In recent months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The route is also very dilapidated in parts.
The Rise of Sex Robots Is Real, and We Should Be Worried
Just when you thought it couldn’t get any crazier in 2017, comes a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, it is.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Professor Emeritus of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
“People make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we’re going to get to see them a lot more often,” Mr. Sharkey said at the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm – with consciously human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs, selecting everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it gets even more troubling as many robots possess the “personalities” that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible," True Companion's website enthuses.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn’t like what you don’t like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She may be tired, fixated on conversation, or she may be “in the mood”!
There are many troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots — not least because they replace real human relationships — but the submissive female traits, the allusions to rape, when you take a step toward Frigid (reluctantly named here: Farrah), worry you the most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
“If women (sic) can have a vibrator, then why can’t men have Roxxxy?”
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they still remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks out of the margins can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is some overlap that these sophisticated sex robots emerge at a time when women’s rights are under threat worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Maid') is not the graphic images, the entwined bodies and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but right now it doesn’t feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as possible (albeit with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, in a nutshell, when it comes to their “personalities,” the robots don’t represent real women.
They can’t part with their companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or backstory, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are slaves.
Or to put it in the speech of 2017: Maid
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also divided families in small scale.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the U.S. offering advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We're all purportedly working to crack our filter bubbles.
Less noticed is the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been dealing with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican family she’s fought with for decades because of politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same page.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it strikes me in a broader context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left has been bolstered by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are referring to the creepy possibility that one day his antics will no longer repel us.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of rationality compared to his standards.
I find myself infested by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney’s hilarious version of the madman – the dog on the car roof that pays 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) – both of which, compared to Trump, do indeed appear to be very mild offenses.
If Trump goes, the next Republican candidate only needs to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the Central Park carousel, the largest of the New York City park department carousels, and the best three dollars to spend in the city when you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are growling and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely sinister and the strumming music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings are getting old, the skylines are becoming too familiar to provide much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I’m still not quite through the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage – the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn’t count – but a big roundabout in north London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can walk on it and all have a great time.
If I had been able to rate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week at a department store, I was forced to rate my “experience” with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street, it’s the same thing, plus the option to match the review with a 15% tip – this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood apologetically grinning, while I was tired of the experience of handing her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has left the prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which he suffered, according to prison authorities, after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against a first manslaughter sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine’s Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius’ six-year prison sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Agency said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius is at risk of his sentence being increased to 15 years if the prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Farmer Arnold Finds a Strange Egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were dismissed for the holidays and into secondary schools.
Three of the dismissal students will go to high school in the future, four to secondary school.
Headmaster Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public on Tuesday evening in the Biesental Bürgerhaus in Epfenhofen.
As a symbol of the school discharge, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle that grows up in the chicken yard, but is then released into freedom.
In addition, the lively crowd performed a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hühnerhof auf".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of turning him into a chicken was shattered, and the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
Afterwards, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank’s rehearsal.
The hens danced with the young gamblers who wore cylinders to bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said headmaster Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chicks), but belongs to it.
He will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
This was followed by a speech of thanks to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who repeatedly intervenes in teaching difficulties, and the parents’ representatives.
The chick time is now over, said class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She was reluctant to dismiss her students after two years of teaching, because it had been a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
At the end, all the students sang a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy in the children.
Eight first graders have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been jailed for illegally camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegally tenting people were arrested by the police in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, while an investigation is currently underway.
The Foreign Ministry reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are imposing significant fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What Those Affected Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the emission behaviour of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and, in some cases, Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse is excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europa gives her opinion:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have cheat software," says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the next few months, but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has informed to write to each person concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, this will be done within their framework.
How long should the re-equipment take as a whole?
"Hard to say," said Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on the political pressure.
“We have seen that car manufacturers have so far not acted voluntarily on the issue of the environment.”
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is likely that foreign producers will follow suit, says Smetanin.
Is there a threat of a massive drop in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of this.
But precisely in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there have been no losses in value for older diesels.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prizewinners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are also among the honored this year.
The awards will be handed over in early December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, who became known with progressive TV series, therefore already announced to refrain from participating in the gala.
He told The New York Times: “This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights – even deprive them of the means – and that is a burden on me.”
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
Named after former President John F. Kennedy, the Kennedy Center is the largest cultural facility in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach’s master builder, will retire next year.
The position has already been advertised, but suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work is still a lot of fun for him, as he conveys in the press interview.
He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet met the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible.
In this way, there should still be enough time for training, taking into account the regular notice periods.
Since Haslach acts as a lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present corresponding degrees.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If she could no longer fill them in, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity is important to the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good working atmosphere as well as good mood between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, several important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living", he is sure of the building office and its employees.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: The transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen car park, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun.”
In terms of design, there is a lot of scope for a city builder.
With Haslach’s own building yard and nursery, many things can be reacted quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is listed as a listed building, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" if new buildings are approved, emphasizes the outgoing city architect.
In any case, the city builder has a high level of responsibility.
He is a builder, "in the end everything here is over my table".
He can count on long-time employees for support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been with us for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years.
Wacker also hopes that his successor will stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the position and wants to stay".
Continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further design of the city.
According to the city of Haslach, anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should have a degree in engineering or a bachelor’s degree in architecture and have a good knowledge of building regulations and building planning law.
The municipal building authority is responsible for building and civil engineering, land development planning, land acquisition matters, administration of the municipal properties, the municipal depot with building yard and garden as well as the lower building law authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: Southern railway line closed
According to police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway overpass in the area of Leobener Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e (B116) on the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators assume two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Near the scene of the crime, witnesses had observed a pink scooter and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a Lausbubenschreich," <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch told the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered the train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system as well as the minutes of delay and the costs for rail replacement traffic, penalties of the rail customers could also come to the perpetrators.
Overall, a "significant" sum was to be assumed, said the spokesman.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be conducted without obstructions.
Nearly ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday morning, two of which involved long-distance traffic.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were delayed.
According to <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study claims the exact opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not enter the body.
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan – one of the building blocks of proteins – to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had from these immune cells.”
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environments, if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, but housed separately, did not.
She suspected the difference had to do with the gut microbiomes of the mice — the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequenced and six species of bacteria were found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells emerged.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid—without the bacteria—to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice’s feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: “Developing these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the gut.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have committed a ‘genius’ with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United has signed with Nemanja Matic a "genius", believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Chelsea’s <0xC2><0xA3>40 million signature began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the keeper role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues' pre-Asia tour and managed just 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he needed to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
“We’re going to help him be ready sooner rather than later.”
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more signings, but insisted the club had already done a “fantastic job” of fulfilling three of its four priority new signings.
"Getting three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've gone to great lengths."
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner into the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and dragged in the form of a dreamliner over the USA, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was to be the form of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind is turning: When Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, social democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections.
Only no sparks from the party headquarters, only no headwinds from the alliance - that was the most important wish of the electoral campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees from the Willy Brandt House have been watching the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in terms of headwinds.
They were low blows.
One after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again that Red-Greens simply cannot govern reliably," said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber to the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
The surprise resignation of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state elections, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The Greens Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the renegade Lower Saxon Green MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the will of the voters.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate," said the Federal Managing Director and campaign manager of the Greens to the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
"That can't all be true," sighs an SPD campaigner, when on Friday morning the new Jobsmessage reaches the party headquarters.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands after the transition of the green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the preliminary climax of a whole series of major and minor crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A black eye, nothing more, calmed the comrades at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It was then - and everything became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to stagger, the Düsseldorf bankruptcy flatly killed the party.
The comrades laboriously rallied again in the weeks that followed.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with him came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of state, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was on fire.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication afterwards.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
And then there is Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust gas affair and his role on the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has long been criticized.
Survey scores were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil tried in recent weeks more and more to set accents in the federal government.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were not hidden even comrades in the circle of Martin Schulz.
They let him go, as they promised themselves from Weil a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In doing so, Weil is basically not to blame for the internal conflict between the Greens in Lower Saxony.
Certainly not Schulz.
For the time being, the comrades are therefore trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here above all at the renegade parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is intolerable and damaging to democracy how Mrs. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group, the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Ms. Twesten was elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but via the state list of the Lower Saxon Greens, the Lower Saxon deputy continued.
The logical consequence would be that she would return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The voters' will four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP distorts the election result," Oppermann said.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments by the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding for the town centre III
If you want to renovate your aging house, you can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a review of what has happened so far.
There have been redevelopment areas in Empfingen since 1991.
At that time, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the renovations to date are a "success project" - after all, it is important to promote interior development as well, and not only to open up new building areas.
On 4 April, the Regierungspr<0xC3><0xA4>sidium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a redevelopment area III.
The total amount of funding is 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Receiven.
How does a redevelopment area arise?
According to Schindler, one will investigate where the "really old" houses are.
But it also plays a role whether there is any interest at all in the planned area to rehabilitate.
If necessary, the area boundaries could then also be shifted again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state program "Social City", in the framework of which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the program is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-related basis, i.e. per plot.
The redevelopment area would then eventually be established as a statute.
The funding approval period runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory would first be carried out, in the context of which the parties involved in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire to fill in.
In November or December, if possible, the by-law decision should be made, so that the renovations can be started in the coming year.
Pietzschmann subsequently stated that each municipality must carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is a question of assessing the urban planning abuses and deciding when to rehabilitate and to what extent.
A restructuring note will then also be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself will come to Empfingen again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Land Survey", which deals, among other things, with the structural condition and the refurbishment intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing questionnaire", information on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living space can be provided.
The blue "operational form" is only to be completed if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of subsidies works according to the "wind dog principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
No funding can be “reserved” for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make the present a renovation "tasteful".
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand gesture.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between the thumb and forefinger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed to medical standard.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam’s company also wants to change the locks on homes and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one has now incorporated technology both at home and in his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House's advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands
The White House’s decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month will cost taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military’s figures left to TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was exhibited alongside a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
“I just wanted you to be aware of this because it’s such an unusual event with high visibility,” the commander of the HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn at around 7 a.m. on July 17 for the event at 3 p.m., and stayed until the lawn was cleared that evening between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground during the time with the aircraft.
It was not clear from the records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Datasets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up," replied the deputy commander.
The “Made in America” event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push for health care reform reform underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requesting their use only for a photo op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was providing taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about his predecessor’s use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is thrilled by the 'Made In America' show - which showcases products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to drop the U.S. President at the White House with precise centimeter rates.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings at the White House.
The flight for the “Made in America” event counted in the flight crew’s training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidency support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not take the burden for any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to U.S. Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per hour of flight.
The unit records the aircraft's flight time as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility's home base at Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
“To set the cost for taxpayers based on the estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading,” Walters said.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs included in annual appropriations.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance, and contracting.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was defending the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present things that are made in America this week,” Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight that."
It wasn’t clear if Trump was interacting with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver’s seat of a fire truck.
At the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss facing tricky task
The leader of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga competes in the table third Suchsdorfer SV.
TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will compete in the third-placed Suchsdorfer SV in Kiel tomorrow from 11 a.m.
Despite five games still flawless record, the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained a sense of reality.
Team boss Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar formation.
Especially in the back positions, I think the team is very good.”
Above all, imports from the far north ensure class and stability at Suchsdorfer SV.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to operations in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles,” says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“It’s going to be hard for us, as always.
You need a good bit of luck too.”
The Neuss team for the trip to the far north is practical.
His debut for Blau-Wei<0xC3><0x9F> could be given by Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman, who is currently still active at the Challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, fails to make it to the Bundesliga game, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who is playing at the tournament in Liberec in the Czech Republic, will make his first appearance this season.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
However, he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club on the Alster, M<0xC3><0xA1>té Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one in the junior world ranking in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills the squad.
How America Can Harm the OMV
Donald Trump didn’t seem really happy when he signed into law Wednesday night to tighten sanctions against Russia.
“In his haste to pass the law,” he said, adding that Congress had “packed in a few unconstitutional regulations.”
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was foaming at the US push.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Investors of the domestic OMV, which, together with other European companies, co-finances the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2, have been concerned since then.
The threat landscape is huge.
Nevertheless, it is too early to assess the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
He has 12 weapons to choose from.
"The press" has looked at which of the group could fend off and which could really hurt him.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be the center of attention in the hit series of Netflix
Despite the second season of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar’s killer, Netflix’s series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the richest organization in the world of drug trafficking: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate “like a Fortune 500 company” only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Roll backwards: The city hires 46 kitchen helpers
The city organizes the daycare lunch table itself again.
With fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the urban day care centers, the clock is turned back.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the urban day care facilities (Kitas) on its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the youth welfare department, this is good news: "We were all very happy".
Cooking continues to take place outside the home: a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked food refrigerated.
The city operates 46 day care centers in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunchtime.
Last year, 2,800 children each sat at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
"Now, it's not just children who are cared for 45 hours a week who eat lunch in the day care center," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2 pm."
From 1 September, 46 part-time employees will have kitchen service: they will heat the delivered food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give out the food, clean up, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are permanently assigned to a daycare center," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the number of hours.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the daycare team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for the kindergarten management to implement pedagogical concepts".
Because that’s what it’s all about: healthy food and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare the food".
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a known force in the nursery, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the day-care center rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done in the future by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only the quality improvement of the kitchen performance, but also the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison between own management and external allocation for the city, according to the press office.
This is despite the fact that 46 new part-time workers are being recruited.
"But these hours are not so important for around 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan Democracy Depends on Women’s Political Role, UN Says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will run in the provincial council elections. Three women run for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international hostilities to a consultative role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will peacefully transfer power from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further enhance Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters are registered.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, allegedly tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police, the men approached the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolping Street, around 2.55 p.m., because they wanted to make a phone call with the girl's mobile phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
As a result, one of the perpetrators tried to grab the phone and the necklace of the girl, which, however, failed.
Without any loot, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB concerns over investment in McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to check with managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at their Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would “be the first to know” if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company’s store manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie’s to “express concern that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be advanced.”
GMB Senior Organiser Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie.”
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: “The store manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland just yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate its continued commitment to employees and union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business – and this applies to all our business areas and locations – in order to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize Tollcross’s legacy as a manufacturing facility, and should our operations change at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
La Liga's side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won’t let up in her pursuit of Neymar after she made an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record heist three years ago?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window this summer as the Ligue 1 club is poised to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million last season.
Upon completion, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world, offering wages of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week.
Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club that wanted one of PSG’s best players signed.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players to sign with them, there will be consequences.”
Barcelona seem to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their price offers to Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
In the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overturned a scooter parked in Königsfelder Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in front of the property number 30 and thus caused property damage of more than 200 euros to the vehicle’s fairing.
The police Schramberg, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for clues.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car met him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to dodge and touched the guardrail.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was with his VW around 7.55 pm on the B 215 from Stolzenau coming in the direction of Leese.
In the area around Stolzenau, he was met by a car in his lane, so that he had to turn right.
The Touran driver touched the guardrail.
There was damage to the car.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without having to worry about the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it can be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses to the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the Commissioner’s office in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen-Report exonerates Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases exonerates Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg cathedral spats continues to spark discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church", explained after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral chaplain Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret at their own omissions or their then wrong assessment of the events.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticized that reporting on violence in the cathedral spats was measured with "double standards".
Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are “shameful and shameful acts” that must be punished and prevented in the future; however, the “degree of media manipulation” is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
“The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evil is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal,” Scaraffia writes.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "You like to go to church and that's a found food".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, “beating was a perfectly normal pedagogical means of coping with naughty children like me.”
It would be unfair to apply today’s standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the abuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Quite wrongly, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memoir "My Brother the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report, which the attorney Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg to clarify, say?
Between 1945 and the early 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburg cathedral sparrows were sexually abused "with high plausibility".
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, states: "In summary, it can be stated that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other defendants, it is striking that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him.
In an interview, Hesemann explains why, in his opinion, the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral spats relieves Georg Ratzinger.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against protected persons in the Regensburg cathedral spats" gives a contradictory picture of Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became palpable when a cathedral spat did not bring a top performance musically.
As his biographer, how do you rate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it.
Only eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside of its sphere of effect.
At best, one can accuse him of learning about it too late or of not taking first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, where he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also presents a very excellent testimony, describes him as "warm-hearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and sweets and was "always surrounded by grapes from children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to anger.
That he not only banged chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also spread slaps and pulled too cheeky boys by the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
However, in order to save his honor, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, among parents and teachers alike.
Do you also know such methods of punishment?
Of course, I think every one of us born before 1968.
I too have experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is really about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in preschool, these are, of course, trivial.
One wonders whether it has nothing to do with his fame and his role as Benedict XVI’s brother, that many media outlets were just plunging into him.
Many who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian pope.
But the truth is: the report exonerates Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media in connection with the report, a great deal was reported about the topic of abuse in the Regensburg cathedral sparrows.
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or knowledge with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have confided in the master of the cathedral.
Not even the parents were involved.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one affected person on behalf of the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with solving sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choirmaster, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional sense.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger’s role in relation to the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: An interviewed student formulated it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it is ... also really absurd to assume that it is precisely him ... that boys have opened up more forcefully or more clearly or rather than to their parents, boarding school managers, teachers of trust, etc.
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that students affected in advance and/or their environment confided to him could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore to be acquitted of any knowledge.
Thus, he cannot be accused of not having prevented or brought to the notice.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these obnoxious crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much to read about "Gewaltexzessen" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former cathedral conductor Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That’s the big problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed and blended into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
This, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
Because there is a clean separation: between the preschool and the Gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence excesses and, let’s say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, that is also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all happened at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But they had nothing to do with Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he only saw the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On it, as the vast majority of witnesses emphasize, the subject of "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even connect positive memories with him despite violence".
At the most, there is the accusation of looking away.
However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods of time during which it was told of the conditions in preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and about the events at a school where he just did not work and was responsible, (according to the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out that "in preschool the beating penalty will continue to be practiced".
Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when beatings were long since banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they happened in a legal grey area, as each of us probably still knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the victims might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can’t say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the beating penalty in schools in Bavaria was officially abolished.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "trap of anachronism", i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times and also not to what was committed in the preschool of adversities and violence on innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was then usual.
This is all terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked on.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. slapping and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
Which picture of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger give in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Did the issue of punishment also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is to say Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the cathedral sparrows played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But this too must be said once and for all: Without this perfectionism, without the demand for absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class status out of the then more nationally known Regensburg Cathedrals, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and sweets alone one does not turn unruly boys into great singers and stand before every success, no matter in which field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger talking about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I got to know Georg Ratzinger really well and experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, kind, deeply believing and heartfelt person, of whom one cannot imagine that he could harm even one fly.
I regularly get to know how many former cathedral sparrows still today, 23 years after his retirement, keep in regular contact with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
Those who still do not forgive him for once being strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most cathedral sparrows today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and introducing them to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable person of respect, to whom they still look up to today and whom they almost adore.
And please, again clearly: all you accuse him of is methods of education, which were the order of the day at that time.
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.
But it is highly unfair to make a man a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published exonerates him.
Now the decency would be to let a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merits and without whom outside Bavaria and perhaps still Germany no one would know the Regensburg cathedral sparrows, finally in peace.
