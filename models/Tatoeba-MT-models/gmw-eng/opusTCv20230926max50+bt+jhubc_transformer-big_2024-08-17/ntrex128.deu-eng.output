Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly are dismayed by the proposal to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the National Assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
National Assembly members of all political parties fear becoming the target of ridicule.
A Labour Party member said his group was concerned because the name rhymed with “Twp” and “Pwp.”
For non-Welsh readers, "twp" in Welsh stands for "deaf" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A National Assembly member of the Plaid Cymru party said the entire group was “not happy” and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed out the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law on name changes, said: "The final decision on designations for National Assembly members is, of course, up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals that resulted in widespread support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly.
Regarding the title of National Assembly members, the panel favoured Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, while the MWP option was the most widely supported at a public hearing.
National Assembly members seem to be proposing alternative options, but the struggle for a consensus for Chairman Elin Jones to table a bill within weeks could be a problem.
The reform law will include further changes to the National Assembly’s workings, including rules on disqualification of National Assembly members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly can vote definitively on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was scheduled to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province with the similar name of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means that it claims Greek territory, and has repeatedly spoken out against its admission to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, however, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The Bells of St. Martin's Silent in the Face of the Troubles of the Churches in Harlem
“The old people I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Today, both are no more.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People’s social life looks different today,” he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly gather."
With the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders assume, and that they “will be back at the beginning sooner or later.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums where people live who do not support the remaining refuges.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation who held their services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that refused to hire or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was heavily damaged, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly described the carillon as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who rang the carillon in July used other words: "A treasure trove of culture" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has taken place in St. Martin’s in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors drawn in part by the lay leaders of the Church and in part by the diocese of bishops.
The parish board – the community’s governing body composed of lay leaders – expressed written concerns to the diocese in July that the diocese would seek to pass on the costs to the parish board, even though it had not been involved in commissioning the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injured 13-Year-Old in California Diving for Lobstern
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to official statements, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s cries for help and paddled to the boy with several others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was happy to have caught a lobster, but then he realized the boy was screaming, “I’ve been bitten!
I have been bitten!".
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire collarbone had been torn open.
“I screamed that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
For investigation and safety reasons, officials blocked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's attacks Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams with department stores-like cosmetic departments staffed with specialized assistants.
As part of a large-scale push for the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market, which continues to grow as fashion and homeware sales decline, the larger cosmetics departments will be tested in 11 stores nationwide and, if successful, will be expanded to more stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the supermarket’s search for ways to use shop space previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury’s, the scope of its cosmetics offering is doubling for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also, existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees get more space and branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
In addition, the supermarket is relaunching its "boutique" makeup range, making the majority of the products vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
Fragrance Shop will also test at two Sainsbury’s retail outlets, the first in Croydon, south London, last week, and a second in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the transition to buying small amounts of food on a daily basis at local convenience stores means that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Since purchasing the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has established Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores, as well as a number of Habitat points of sale, which has increased food sales and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from the drugstore's branches in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury’s sale of its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan as four stores add an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have reshaped the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our range of brands is tailored to suit all needs, and due to the enticing environment and convenient locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic shopping that challenges the way shopping has been done so far."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
“Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones is “angry” after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for the joint homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The “This Morning” presenter, 37, announced her withdrawal on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered “Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new follow-up contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been “angry” when TV’s “Golden Girl” admitted at a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that they were not able to devote enough time to the joint homewear and accessory brand Truly due to their new business – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and would have likely doubled Willoughby’s estimated net worth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her retirement from Truly on Instagram, Jones left the UK on his way to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: “Truly had by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should secure their future over the next decades for them in the long term.
Their decision to withdraw came as a complete surprise to everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” presenter, one of the UK’s most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holidays together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV show "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones said last night, “We’re not commenting on his business affairs.”
Hard words "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would consider “non-presidential” and for such positive comments about North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said imitating the voice of a news anchor:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s top diplomat, told leaders from around the world on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a “corresponding response” from the US to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. held on to sanctions that were designed to keep up the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of missile tests, assistance in releasing hostages, and repatriation of the remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastate an island in Indonesia, costing hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population was displaced from Lombok, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not requesting international support, so that's a bit difficult," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees will be able to work on site.
Sutopo, spokesman for the Civil Protection Agency, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu on whether international bodies should be allowed to participate in the relief efforts.
In the face of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still regrettably ill-prepared for natural forces.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, these are not an everyday sight on other coastal strips.
The apparently missing tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite a warning that came into force, probably contributed to the deaths.
Travel between Indonesia’s many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster in three days at the earliest.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s battered infrastructure the centerpiece of his election campaign and has spent ample money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the next year's re-election-seeking Joko suffers from financing deficits.
Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, with members of the Muslim majority there practicing a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought each other on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores deep equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at London’s Stamford Bridge Stadium with a goal in the 89th minute from a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri at 1-0 deficit of his team at about 27 meters from Chelsea's goal.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it towards the rear post.
The shot sailed high over the penalty area and drifted into the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I was just trying to put myself in that position and get to the ball, players like Shaq are always playing as much forward as possible, so I was just trying to make as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led after a goal in the 25th minute by the Belgian star Eden Hazard at the half with 1-0.
The Blues striker gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a quick double pass in midfield.
He then shot a good steep pass, so Hazard got into the penalty area.
Hazard left the defenders behind and closed with a left shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the back of the net.
Liverpool will play in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Death toll in Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the civil protection agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the rubble of buildings collapsed by Friday’s 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which had caused waves up to six meters high, official spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was littered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
After the discovery of a female body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was launched.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police ask the residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask all those who have been near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I ask all persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken anything with a dashcam to contact us. They may have information that is of the utmost importance to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was living in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are in the process of informing the victim’s next of kin.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was just trying to get into his apartment, but was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now informed that it will take hours before they can enter the building again.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared dissolved in tears at the scene.
She repeats again and again, “This is so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the barrier and another vehicle was in front of the barrier.
Inside the barrier were several police officers who monitored the apartment block.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and refer to log entry 247 dated September 30.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament is the latest monument to be the subject of dispute over rewriting history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell became a target in front of the Palace of Westminster.
The iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more so at the end of the 19th century than today, to be someone who defended Parliament against outside pressure, in his case, of course, from the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this divide.
His accomplishments as a Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer Pig Bites Chinese Farmers to Death
According to local media reports, a farmer in a market in southwestern China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man, for whom only the surname "Yuan" was named, was found dead with a severed artery overflowing with blood near a pigsty at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pigsty was open.
He said that there was a large male pig with blood on his snout in the stable.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilo pig had bitten the farmer dead.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," the cousin, whose last name was "Wu," was quoted as saying by the Guiyang Evening News.
Shots of a security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been detained to prevent attacks on more people while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although it is rare for pigs to attack humans, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, suffering serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 290 kilos trapped a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer’s wife could scare the animal away.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playful.
They like to pinch and are very curious, ... they are not out to hurt anyone.
You just have to treat them with the right level of respect,” he said.
The Remains of Hurricane Rosa Bring Widespread Heavy Rain to the Southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens on its way over the colder waters on Mexico’s northern coast.
Rosa, however, will bring flooding-triggering rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. east coast time, Rosa had wind speeds of 136 km/h, equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, heading east to the west coast of the U.S. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is carried north to the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will cause up to 25 centimetres of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical humidity creates widespread rainfall in the southwest through interactions with the approaching trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall can cause dangerous flood-like flooding, water-dwelling debris, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to precipitation rates of nearly 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour in places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation is expected.
Due to the scattering of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of flood-like flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In view of the threat of tropical rainfall, it is strongly discouraged to go on foot in the desert.
Heavy rainfall can cause canyons to become torrential, and thunderstorms bring local gusts of wind as well as wind that carries dust.
The approaching trough brings locally heavy rain to parts of the southern California coast.
Total precipitation amounts of more than one centimeter are possible, which can lead to small amounts of debris floating in the water and to smooth road surfaces.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
The first scattered tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and it rains widely on Monday evening and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, heavy rain spreads to the Four Corners region and continues through Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday in the middle of the USA there is a good example of drastic temperature differences.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12oC.
In the next few days, the persistent summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
For much of the central and eastern U.S., a warm beginning of October with widespread temperatures around 27°C from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast is expected.
New York City could hit 27 degrees on Tuesday, about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
Over 20 million viewers watched on six television networks on Thursday the compelling testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political stalemate persisted, with the television stations interrupting their regular program on Friday over a last-minute twist: an agreement negotiated by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party, harassed her, and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen saw the hearing.
The company tracked average viewership across CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network that broadcasted the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring viewership in offices.
To put this into perspective: This roughly corresponds to the number of spectators at a play-off football game or at the Oscar ceremony.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion-driven moderators strongly support Kavanaugh’s nomination, recorded the highest number of any network, with an average of 5.69 million viewers at the all-day hearing.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office released a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by CNN and CBS cameras as protesters loudly harassed him in the elevator on the way to a hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood for minutes with his eyes lowered while he was being scolded, and the scene was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
“You have power while so many women are powerless,” said one woman.
Flake said his office had released a statement and added before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and broadcast networks broadcast live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on forwarding Kavanaugh’s nomination to the entire Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, as requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with a friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was of great importance as it was obvious that without the investigation, Republicans would not have enough votes to endorse Kavanaugh.
President Trump has ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations made against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, accused critics of her plans for leaving the European Union to use Britain’s future for political purposes and undermine the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is due to attend the Conservative Party convention in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside the interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, intensified his attack on her so-called “Chequers plan” for Brexit by calling a proposal that involves the reciprocal collection of tariffs by the UK and the EU “completely absurd.”
Deadly shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained for manslaughter, according to Baton Rouge police.
According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight, but was unable to return to the scene.
According to CBS affiliate WAFB, police secured the glasses at the crime scene and said Simpson’s DNA was found on the glasses.
After an interview with Simpson, the police said he confessed to the fatal shots fired at Wayde.
The lawyer said the bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
Police are thanking the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the federal police's forensic lab, Southern University Police, and local residents for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the Regional Executive for “their care and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply shaken" by Wayde's death and "is in shock."
“You’re always afraid of that,” Wade said.
Volcano spews ash on Mexico City.
Ash ejected from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 ejections of gas and ash were registered within 24 hours.
The agency monitored numerous cases of rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between riot police and pro-independence protesters, and thousands took part in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by riot police, threw eggs at them and also hurled paint powder, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which were usually populated by tourists.
During the rest of the day, there were also handcuffs with the police, who used their batons to contain the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness" while facing unionists shouting "Long live Spain."
The local press reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
One year after the October 1 referendum, which was seen as illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, although turnout was low, as opponents of secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes outside polling stations.
Pro-independence groups had camped outside overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part with his wife in the separatist protest, said he no longer sees the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence with hope.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could choose, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite an important, albeit brief, victory in last December’s regional elections, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their best-known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in favor of the police, said the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is becoming more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced his candidacy for next year’s European Parliament election.
“To run as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the dismantling of democratic values and the repression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was rammed by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a house in Londonderry was repeatedly rammed by a car.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. after British daylight saving time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, a crossbow may have been shot at the car.
Menga hit means 1-0 victory over Rangers for Livingston
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to Steven Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal proved to be crucial for Gary Holt's team to equalize with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team remains without an away win in the Premiership this season and faces the Hearts on Sunday, eight points behind.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, can increase his winning streak in the division to six games, meaning head coach Holt hasn’t lost since taking over from Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against outspoken playing guests
Holt’s team should have been in the lead long before the hit, as his directness presented the Rangers with a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's headshot past the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way, the decisive gate came into being.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston prepared a chance in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson together put Menga in position, who shot the goal with a ball contact from the center of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated possession, but were unable to overcome the hosts' defenses, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unmolested.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was fended off by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow slid the ball past from another standard Livingston situation.
Flanks kept coming into Livingston’s penalty area and were regularly taken out of danger, while two required penalties – one from Halkett against substituted Glenn Middleton and one for handplay – were denied.
“Phenomenal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were without exception outstanding and exceeded expectations again in this upward trend.
Her style of play and team have hardly changed since returning to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has rocked the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor kept Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they were able to penetrate the hosts’ team – and this is something of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) there were smiling faces and blue skies as the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was intended to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then travelled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for keeping a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – also made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and reviled by others as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
In a collision with a car, a cyclist died in London.
The collision occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. British Summer Time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics took care of the man, but he died at the scene of the accident.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had died in an accident with a driver’s flight on Childers Street, about one mile from Saturday’s accident.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Road closures and diversions for buses are set up, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Officials Injured in Riots
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in riots in a maximum security prison for men.
The riots broke out on Sunday at around 9:30 a.m. British Summer Time at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still continuing.
Specialized Tornado officials were called in to end the riots involving eight inmates confined to one wing.
The officers were treated on the spot for minor injuries to the face.
A Prison Service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to address an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and possibly spend longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was being treated at the hospital after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, police officers were called to the prison to deal with serious riots in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flood-like floods (drought areas may benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s what’s likely to happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert-dominated southwest, bringing with it the risk of flood-like flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of flood-like flooding Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, as well as southeastern California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach with rain on Monday night and pull right over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have come within 200 miles of Phoenix as a tropical storm or depression!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64 km) of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation with occasional up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert-dominated southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely and in some cases up to 10 centimeters in total.
For those who are not at risk of flood-like flooding, the rainfall associated with pink can be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, this rain is likely to be useful in part, as there is currently a drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, in just over 40 percent of Arizona, at least extreme drought occurs, the second-highest category,” weather.com reported.
Initially, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will hit land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and will be 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, before moving north at 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder waters and weaken as a result.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to hit land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
Rainfall can be heavy in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, precipitation totals are expected to be 7.5 to 15 centimeters, with up to 25 centimeters possible," weather.com reported.
Then, as a tropical storm, Rosa will move north over Mexico, reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move up through Arizona into southern Utah until late Tuesday evening.
"The main hazard associated with Rosa or her remains is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonoran Desert and the desert-influenced southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
As a result of this rainfall, life-threatening flood-like floods and water-drifting debris are expected in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
After the discovery of a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured at around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is "stable."
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked anyone who has records of what happened on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “from the meanness, the anger” of the Democrats.
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and outrageous tactics of the Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered “from the meanness, the anger” of the Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, dismissing the allegation made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her decades ago when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her accusation.
The president said Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record in service to the public," he told the crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican voters’ participation in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don’t play, but in reality I play,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump argued that the Democrats see their mission as “resistance and blocking.”
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday, a senior GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake, death toll rises
According to the authorities, at least 384 people were killed on Saturday, many of whom were swept away after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the beaches on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when at nightfall up to six meters high waves hit the beach, ripping many people to death and destroying everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat came up yesterday, people were still going about their activities on the beach and didn’t immediately run away, and they fell victim to it,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s civil protection agency BNPB, told a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it swept cars, tree trunks and houses with it, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people had climbed trees on the run from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and placed in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the Civil Protection Agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s massive quake was equivalent to 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have gotten bigger, the authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as “comprehensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
According to Nugroho, communication with Donggala was completely paralysed, and there was no information.
According to a Red Cross statement, more than 300,000 people live there, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the authority was widely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves arrived at the time of the warning, according to official data.
Amateur footage published on social media shows a man on the upper floor of a building desperately shouting to warn the people on the street below him of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water slams onto the shore, flushing buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that disrupted communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo planes with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees are still in urgent need of food and other vital goods.
The city's airport will remain closed until October and has been reopened only for relief efforts.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The location is very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in tent shelters in the courtyard of their office, but, according to Doseba, they have come past scenes of devastation along the way.
"They said they had seen numerous destroyed houses," he said.
The location is very bad.
Even when the aid groups started with the hard task of setting disaster relief in motion, some complained that expert foreign helpers would be prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible if the location of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"At the moment, it is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international support, but so far this status has not applied.”
As the second night since Friday’s earthquake and tsunami sank over Palu, friends and family of those still missing hoped for one of the miracles to lighten the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped for two days under rubble next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of the prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel were, as Mandagi added, his students.
“As a senior paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Gendon recounted how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliders made the rounds, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competition participants from Palu who attended the beach party.
However, instead of blue ticks, his messages only led to grey question marks.
"I think that means the news hasn't been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport police press release, on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink’s employee filling an ATM.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to make more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, "a man came running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for the vending machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not state how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information on the identity of the suspects are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, “The being formally known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album “Yandhi” is expected.
He appears on the show as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has canceled for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only an abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has a religious meaning for West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the word most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said in a conversation this year about his album with radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, it is us.
Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, became just ‘Ye’ – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but announced this year that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West used to work, has already written his name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers fired on a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people, and left-wing student movements were establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans through monthly student grants and the opening of additional free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities were feeding young people to criminal gangs.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
Given China’s increased activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on research in this area, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, even though the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: the country intends to become the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Duplicating the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are so much further behind the U.S., and we’re looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances that the next big AI success would be achieved in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranking American Othello player, and later served as a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China office.
Lee paid tribute to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and asked for the timing of the next competition to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government subsidies.
“It’s not China that takes away the top academic talent, but the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI in recent years.
In Lee’s opinion, a change in U.S. immigration policy could also be conducive to U.S. AI efforts.
"I think that in the field of AI, people with a PhD should automatically be offered green cards," he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lee, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to award funds to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a special artificial intelligence committee.
In addition, DARPA announced this month the $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million annually in AI research.
In the meantime, U.S. legislation regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has done nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would settle a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that it claims Greek territory, so Greece has vetoed Macedonia’s inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign casts doubt on voter turnout reaching the 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper was: "Do you support membership of NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, inclusion in organizations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said they would stick to the result so that it is decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 percent of registered voters had cast their votes.
“I’m here for my children to vote, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their votes in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018 in a referendum on changing the country’s name, which would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised head, not through the back entrance," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in much-needed investment for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after his vote.
In his words, a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvers through all of Brighton's defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton defence in the 2-0 victory of Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his 65th minute goal look ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several other defenders at the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
He then shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty area to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame with his right shoe Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan and shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet,” city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were talking about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this move far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few moves to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker aimed the ball into the net just before it slipped out.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to spoil the game for the Rockies
Since the Nationals have been eliminated from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another bet.
The ever-performing Scherzer, however, hopes to stand on the hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if this is relevant to the playoffs for the Rockies, who have a game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies scored at least one wildcard with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Even though we’re not playing for anything, we can at least throw as we know the atmosphere among the spectators here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level I’d come across this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in this competition?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting player for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let Scherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starting player, practiced in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington right-hander has a statistics of 18-7 this season, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump to hold rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation related to Brett Kavanaugh, whom he chose for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of Republican voters’ participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
That’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not running, but in reality I’m running, so I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power by all means, you see the meanness, the abomination.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give them.”
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission as “to resist and block.”
“And you see that in the last four days,” he said, describing the Democrats as “angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest.”
He named the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which caused loud boos among the public.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did you allow the document to reach the outside world?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for you one -- that was a really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer holds all opinions.
The party is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to reprimand me, this came as little surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs who are told they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she had vigorously opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for having a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "the meetings should involve all and be productive".
Most of the Friday night GC sessions in my eight years as a local Labour MP were just that.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings are not marked by this tone, and the promised "kinder, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting views will not be tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion will be judged by whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues with whom I previously believed to share similar political views now expected me to turn around and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – be it in terms of national security or the European single market.
Whenever I speak in public – no matter what I say – there follows a rant on social media calling for my election, denouncing the political center and saying that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with that experience, I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I feel better than some of my colleagues, as the comments addressed to me are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day and yet never give in.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that verbal abuse has become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn called last week for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer accept all opinions, and with every motion of censure and every change in the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
I have often been advised in the last two years to retract my head and not to express my opinion so clearly, and then I would 'have no problems'.
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which literally caused my classroom to fall apart in the general school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – as a municipal councillor as well as as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a secret of my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be in the dark about my political positions and areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To the supporters of Friday’s motion, I just want to say the following: Given the fact that the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I am sending this one message not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no matter how many electoral threats or political agendas will stop me from acting in my opinion in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: Undefeated Ayr team climbs to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the win in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
You are now the only one of the ten teams unbeaten at the top of the table.
In the end, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as their better exploitation of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been put to the test in our games so far, and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said, “Recognition for Ayr, they took their chances better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, raised by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the lead, but Melrose was able to let the numbers speak due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been exempted for the game by the Warriors, and Jason Baggot caught a non-elevated try.
Climo extended Ayr’s lead with a penalty kick before scoring a goal right at half time and then scoring an increased try on his own so that it was 17:5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose started the second half well, however, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
After a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott who was carried off the pitch, Ayr extended his lead through a Climo-enhanced attempt by Stafford McDowall.
Then Blair Macpherson, acting as captain of Ayr, received a yellow card, and again Melrose at the end of a period of enormous pressure caused the extra man to pay by a non-elevated attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the advancing Ayr package from the penalty lane.
Climo increased as almost since the break after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's boxkick and sent flanker Gregor Henry to the home team's fifth attempt.
'Still Game' star seems ready for new career in gastronomy
“Still Game” star Ford Kieran seems poised for a change to the hospitality industry after it turned out he was named as the CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC programme, whose scripts he writes and in which he plays one of the leading roles together with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow's "floral restaurant business."
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, enclosed by land, hopes that a court will open the way for it to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in front of the corduroy-decorated naval headquarters in La Paz.
There is a blue flag in public buildings.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have the motto: “The sea is our rightful property.
To win it back is an obligation.”
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the stretch of coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th century resource conflict is as vivid as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice to be delivered on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will follow the ICJ’s ruling on large screens in the hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s demand, which, after decades of sporadic talks, obliges Chile to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea by Bolivia.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is about to face a controversial battle for his re-election next year, there’s also a lot at stake in Monday’s ruling.
"We are about to return to the Pacific," he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that this would also change little.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not authorized to assign Chilean territory and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
In the opinion of Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law, the ICJ’s ruling was already available six months after the final plea, suggesting that the case was “not complicated”.
Far from supporting Bolivia’s case, the last four years could also be a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has taken over the issue of access to the sea," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She indicated that Morales' bellicose rhetoric suffocated Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but after these events, this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia has “an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “put an end to the 139-year-long disputes for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the theme of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only happen if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to translate into action the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of rivals in Singapore.
His remarks come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of reinstating stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri described the idea that further sanctions and U.S. resistance to a declaration to end the Korean War would ever bring the North to its knees as a "brain trick."
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Showcase the Latest Collections of Huge Headwear Coming Soon to the Shopping Streets Near You
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer have to look for it.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showcased a range of crazy oversized headwear on the catwalk for their 2019 summer collection that captivated the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations across the catwalk.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was a flamboyant beige hat with a feathery wide edge that almost crushed the models’ heads.
As other oversized accessories, jewel-studded watermelons, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple were shown, but these are not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were fitted with sewn-on lips and were more similar to Hannibal Lecter than to haute couture.
One creation resembled a diving gear, including snorkeling and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to make another huge fashion statement, you’re in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that the huge headgear could find its way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly on "La Bomba", the straw hat with 60 centimetres wide rim, which everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski wears.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat that made big waves on social media sent another big creation across the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost the size of the swimsuit-wearing model holding the bag.
The bast bag in reddish orange with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect that large hats and beach bags will be available in the shopping streets next summer, and the designer has caused so much attention that the demand for oversized accessories will be hard to ignore.”
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence, which has continued in 2018 with further outstanding examination results and is only underpinned by individual and joint successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other collaborative ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of care to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought-after in schools as electives.
Nelson Mandela once said, “When you talk to someone in a language they understand, you reach their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is an impressive reminder that we can’t just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s results, we see that languages with the highest pass rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages achieved the grade A in the higher examinations.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools revealed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin scored A on the higher exams, while 72 percent of students learning German, 69 percent of students learning French, and 63 percent of students learning Spanish also scored A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered electives as well as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for problems filling vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more vacancies require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people a head start over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language teaching.
Children who speak multiple languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other will teach languages considered most important for the UK with a view to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests lie, independent schools will always have a range of languages with appropriately specialized teachers to choose from.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future looks like.
At this point in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James compete for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait will soon come to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
How many minutes he will play, however, has not yet been determined.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely only play for a few minutes.
Earlier this week, after training, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five rallies scheduled for next week, including at well-meaning places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the pending vote to confirm his election to the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections in November as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the process.
When will Trump’s rally in West Virginia take place tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia below as a livestream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings on allegations of sexual misconduct led in a tense atmosphere this week, with the expected Senate vote on confirmation remaining in limbo for up to a week as the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main goal of this rally series is to support Republicans who must face up to a difficult November election.
As a result, President Trump’s campaign told Reuters that these five rallies next week will serve to “mobilize volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to maintain and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control of Congress is so important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season approaches,” a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to give his name, told Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could attend the rally scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, and media from Pittsburgh could report.
Saturday’s visit is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows combat readiness to maintain hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday afternoon’s fours may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a pure invention as a sports concept, but one that players really believe in, especially at competitions like this one.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
“They were in the lead with six points, and now it’s four, so I think that’s a little momentum for us,” Jordan Spieth said as he left the venue.
Europe, of course, has the advantage and is four points ahead, with twelve more to follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can each show three out of four points.
Spieth was incredibly strong from tee to green and sets a good example.
The guttural screams of enthusiasm grew louder as he sank an important putt to win the fourth four-point match for both of them after he and Thomas trailed by two points after two holes.
His putt, which decided the match for them on the 15th hole, triggered a similar cry, which suggests that the American team is not out of the game yet.
“I really need to kneel down and take care of my own game,” Spieth said.
This is all that remains for the individual players.
18 holes to make a mark.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have been the only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, undoubtedly writing the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s unequal but likeable duo is at four out of four points and can’t go wrong.
“Moliwood” wasn’t the only pair who hadn’t hit a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the exuberant crowd underpins that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to seal a possible European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, speaking of European fame would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short trial with Sergio Garcia, the morning's hero of four, who played alongside Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swedes in a jam that they could not nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you.
The fours and fours pairings are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give or don’t give, and the way a strategy can change at lightning speed.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day, but this round of four has also shown that the U.S. team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the U.S., had doubted.
Europe takes the lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is ahead of the USA 10:6 after Saturday’s fours and fours and will advance to the final day of the Ryder Cup with a solid lead.
The brilliant-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over Tiger Woods, who was struggling with difficulties, and was thus able to score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, who wants to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the morning fours against the faulty playing American team and won the series 3-1.
In the four games, the United States resisted more and won two matches, but could not make up the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve singles played on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood became the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, christened "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, only became the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized excellently and beat the disenchanted Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally flashed his brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning fours, returned to play as Henrik Stenson’s partner in the fours, winning 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world’s number one and three.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris not everything went according to their ideas.
Three-time Major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 victory over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fours 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only happened twice that a team came back after going into the singles with a four-point deficit, but as the title holder, a draw is enough for Furyk's team to keep the trophy.
Having only been in second place for two days, it doesn’t look like they could launch a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly last year that North Korea had taken “essential measures out of goodwill” last year, for example, stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and committing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technologies.
"We do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the U.S., there is no trust in our national security, and in these circumstances, we will by no means unilaterally disarm first.”
While Ri relied on North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phase-by-phase” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea was rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the outset, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, in which Kim had pledged to work towards “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump pledged guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, while the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes calls for a easing of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on 'first denuclearization' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and is even opposed to the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a figment of the imagination of those who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not elaborate on plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US head of state had highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea’s head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were the other party on the denuclearization issue instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to this halt.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was vastly different from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the US mainland with North Korea’s missiles after “evil President” Trump referred to Kim as a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea last year, showered praise on Kim at the United Nations for his courage in taking disarmament steps, but he said there was a lot of work to be done and that the sanctions would have to remain in place until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must in any case continue vigorously until we achieve complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to financially dry up Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not been successful.
In July, he said on departure from Pyongyang that progress had been made, only to be accused hours later by North Korea of having made “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea vowed this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile base and nuclear complex if the United States took “appropriate action.”
He said Kim had told him that the targeted “appropriate measures” were security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all undergraduate students get more sleep this year. This is a measure against the spreading macho culture of staying awake with caffeine and learning all night long.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unneeded when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is in his opinion the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only learning about this now, in my last year?’
According to her, no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This year’s first course explained to students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, students see a picture of a room in a dorm and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of lack of sleep on athletic performance, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.
They are then encouraged to reflect on their daily routine using a map of the university campus with interactive symbols.
“We know that it won’t change the behavior of the students right away.
But we believe they have the right to know this – just like you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health,” added Professor Czeisler.
Proud of “pushing a night shift” is still common, he said, adding that modern technologies and ever-increasing pressure on students made lack of sleep a growing problem.
Ensuring good sleep should be the "secret weapon" of all students against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and weight gain could be avoided, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of his courses in his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before they begin their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler's recommendation, students should set an alarm clock for bedtime and wake-up time, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emanating from electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm.
Livingston vs. Rangers 1:0: Menga goal defeats Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's goal for Steven Gerrard's disunited playing team meant a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted their first away win since the 4-1 victory at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team conceded Gerrard the only second loss in 18 games as manager, so his team is eight points behind the Hearts by far in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before half time, and the low-inspiration Rangers didn’t seem to have a chance to equalise.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and is only behind Hibernian in the goal difference.
The Rangers are also in danger of further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound from an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which overtook Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who took a point off the Hearts last week, and would have to be thrilled by how his well-trained team kept their opponent under pressure at every turn.
The Rangers dominated possession, but Livingston achieved more when they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal in just two minutes, when Menga's first drop led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and missed the shot.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only pass the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their game looked more hopeful than confident in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that he should have received a penalty kick after a quarter of an hour due to a clash between him and Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson did not allow the Colombian's complaints to stand.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's 34th minute goal may not have been the same as the game, there's no denying that they earned it solely for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers could not handle a ball that Jacobs had shot for a long time in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the calm and picked Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent at half-time, and the change was effective almost immediately as winger Morelos moved into position, but impressive Kelly rushed off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to get the guests to play exactly the game they were looking for, with Lithgow and Halkett getting one long ball at a time.
Holt's team could have extended their lead in the final stage, but McGregor held up well and fought off Jacobs before Lithgow shot a header from the corner.
Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also called for a penalty kick late for a mix with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as a Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become the standard element of science, also became a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Actually, I hear a crack!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine may teach immune system to ‘see’ degenerate cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy degenerate cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize degenerate cells.
The method removes immune cells from a patient, which are modified in the laboratory.
These cells can “see” a protein common to many cancers and are then re-injected.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize degenerate cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method removes immune cells from a patient, which are modified in the laboratory in such a way that they can "see" the protein HER2 common to many cancers, and then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of various types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method, in which patients are taken immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells, has helped in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West released a pro-Trump tirade after his appearance at SNL, wearing a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio at Saturday Night Live after he widely praised US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to run for president in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", wearing a Make-America Great-Again cap, he continued with a rant against the Democrats, stressing once again his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by white people, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist.’
So, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's rant was not broadcast, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of West with the release.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the stage because of his headgear.
“They harassed me behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with the cap.’
You've been harassing me!
And then they say I'm in a submerged area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken area?" He said he will "put on my Superman cape, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His remarks elicited boos from the audience at least twice, and SNL contributors seemed embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine: "It became deathly quiet in the studio."
West had been hired late as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture entitled "I Love It", in which he was disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR OPPOSITING THE MASS.”
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I do NOT want to reward someone who, in my opinion, adopts and gives away an ideology that is harmful to my community (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now “The being formally known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then into “The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.”
Charged with attempted murder in connection with stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man with a knife was injured in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast Court of Arbitration on Monday.
The allegations are being investigated by the public prosecutor.
'Game of Thrones' Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword-wielding Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones.”
However, the 31-year-old actor has attacked the macho hero's stereotype, saying such roles on the screen often make boys feel like they have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believes something went wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, who is also a part of Game of Thrones, admitted that solving the problem was "very important" to him.
"I personally find the question of what went wrong with masculinity very important at the moment," he said.
"What have we taught growing men about the problem we are now observing?"
Harington believes that television may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is being taught on TV and on the street that makes boys feel like they have to embody that particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change that?
“Something has gone wrong for young people.”
He also admitted in the interview that after the end of the series, he would not participate in prequels or sequels of "Game of Thrones" next summer. He has "enough of battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Harington will star in a new edition of Sam Shepard’s True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing about "Game of Thrones" for him was that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so that's how I got my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie starred in the Emmy-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the mistress of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, transmission took place through sexual intercourse in the vast majority of new cases.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
In China, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 year-on-year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
Based on the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, universal access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employees leaked GOP senators' data, criticises "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. House of Representatives MP Maxine Waters denied on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators on the Wikipedia pages of the deputies.
The Democrat from Los Angeles held the opinion that the claims of "ultra-right" experts and websites were being spread.
“Lying, lying, and even more heinous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released will include the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct made against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was assigned to Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
"This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly sparked online criticism, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
People who are accused of something they didn’t do shouldn’t be angry.
You must not be defiant.
You must not question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Review of “Johnny English – You Only Live Three Times” – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every British-colored new film, and this seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy parody franchise “Johnny English”, which began in 2003 with “Johnny English – The Spy Who Spoiled It” and resurrected in 2011 with “Johnny English – Now Even More”.
Is an ironic self-parody on the subject of how obviously stupid we are becoming the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glitzy, grimace-cutting and incompetent Johnny English for screwing up has been extended for the second time. His name signals more than anything that he is a general comic creation for cinema visitors in a non-English-speaking area.
Of course, he’s once again the crazy secret agent who bizarrely thinks he’s cool and worldly, when in reality he’s made up of some clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean, and a clack of this fellow who contributed a single note to the title tune of “The Hour of the Victor” at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos left behind by travelers and international secret agents that Atkinson played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades were briefly attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy emerges, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because even the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" now offer self-assured comedic elements.
The humor seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and to me Johnny English’s crazy misadventures aren’t as imaginative and focused as Atkinson’s silent movie gags in the role of Bean.
The ever-present premise now is that Britain is in grave danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on duty, much to the displeasure of the agent on duty, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and pressured figure who is already facing total collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script doesn’t give much to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies have been unmasked and she must therefore bring someone out of retirement.
This includes the clumsy Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a chic institution, but unofficially teaches undercover agent work, with a few gags, as English offers an espionage academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former, heavily vetted crony, Bough, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, an annoying woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who always go horribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously captivated by a charismatic tech billionaire, Jake Lacy’s sinister Jason Volta, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque jokes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant, create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta’s luxury yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to acquaint himself with the interior of Volta’s house with the help of a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, all the registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as it is, the topic is already dealt with in detail on children's television.
Pretty mediocre fabric.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, “Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly lives up to his talent?”
Labour denies working on a plan according to which the British work four days a week but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week but be paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants company leaders to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) to workers in the form of an extra day off.
The employees would have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea 'fits' the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country to the benefit of workers.
The move to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day work week is an endeavor consistent with the Party’s approach to restoring economic equilibrium for the benefit of workers and with the Party’s general industrial policy strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to endorse such an idea. Already the Green Party promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the approach as a whole is not currently endorsed by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concretized his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “profit makers” at public utilities.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not get their entire share back, as a Labour government could make “deductions” due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to appoint employees to the boards of companies and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand over 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who collect annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss whether the FBI's investigation into the Kavanaugh case could change their mind
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency’s findings could influence Republican senators to win their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could bring something to light that could ultimately change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said at the hearing that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, this claim was made, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and unequivocal."
Graham’s voice, however, seems to be set in stone.
“My opinion is clear about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to be a bombshell,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has denied this vehemently," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all those who called her could not confirm it."
It is now 36 years.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which is taking place for the 7th time this year, to not only witness the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s ultimate goal: fighting extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that seeks to fight poverty by encouraging more and more people to actively participate in poverty alleviation.
To get a free ticket to the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to complete a number of tasks, such as volunteering, communicating with a global leader (by email or phone), or similar actions to raise awareness of the goal of fighting poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen still has 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of offering a cool free concert a meaningful way to convince others that it’s time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think you can make a difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announced that the project has seen more than 19 million actions from its supporters since 2011 and has achieved various goals.
These actions are said to have helped inspire leaders around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised through fundraising.
According to the group’s estimates, the secured funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include The Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of investors and implementers based in the UK who have committed to supporting children in their optimal development and who have promised to help Rwanda fight malnutrition in the country with $35 million after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provides nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of what are the reasons why Global Citizen can combat extreme poverty,
They replied, “It will be a long and exhausting road with ups and downs.
But similar to the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists to perform at this year’s event in New York, along with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The US could use the navy for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports – Interior Ministry
According to Washington Examine, Washington can rely on the Navy if necessary, so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets, including the Middle East, said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s deployment to Syria is a pretext for exploring new energy markets, and Russia is currently operating in these areas at the invitation of the legitimate government.
“I think the real reason for Russia’s deployment in the Middle East is to negotiate new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways to address this.
“The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that maritime roads remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees at the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that sees itself as the “voice of electricity consumers” in the U.S.
He drew a comparison between Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are virtually identical.
“Using and replacing fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one trick pony” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made when the Trump administration was in the process of expanding exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, the government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, with which, according to Trump, Berlin became the “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all think that energy should not be used as a means to exert pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves,” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has received headwinds from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply," said the BDI board member Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Wants to “Exactly Examine” 2020 Presidential Candidacy, Massachusetts Senator Says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would “precisely examine” a presidential candidacy following the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to “precisely examine” a presidential candidacy after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is steering this country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump is handling our democracy,” she said.
Warren has not spoken out in her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that an FBI investigation is, of course, required before the vote.
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe they should run for 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe poll, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy; with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposing.
Other names of prominent Democrats eligible for a 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin speaks at Donald Trump-Ralley on post-traumatic stress disorder, which Palin suffers from
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, all of this can be felt by other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as an "elephant in the room" and said about her son and other war veterans that they are coming back in a different way, that they are coming back more incubated, that they are coming back and wondering if there is this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and every other member of the military have given the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a legal remedy for the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support an appeal to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a court-appointed statement Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is challenging policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang sons" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace referred to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where very many people apply for asylum in the US, as nations struggling with major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of legislation at the state, state, and international levels.”
"The federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed based on the respective facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle," the court expert statement stated.
Further, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policies denying immigrants access to the country had an unfavourable impact on the U.S. economy, as immigrants could be more likely to be entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
“Asylum is available to anyone who leaves their home country because they are persecuted or because of fear due to race, religion, nationality or affiliation with a particular social group or political persuasion,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
It was never the plan to defuse all the problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems that people face worldwide every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as death toll doubles in race with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It's all very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little feverish son in a rescue center in the destroyed downtown of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed homes to collect their soaked belongings and to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals, which were damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who contracted vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside Palu Military Hospital, where outdoor patients were treated for the ongoing strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he recounted how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went too fast.
I think I was trapped under the collapsed walls," he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cries for help, but then there was rest.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they are in a safe place."
US ambassador accuses China of tyranny with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American daily announcing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of exploiting the American press for progaganda purposes.
U.S. Donald Trump referred to the China Daily’s paid supplement in the Des Moines Register last Wednesday, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, an indictment that China denies.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing has attempted to interfere in the US elections are in line with US officials’ message to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to run ads to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in an exorbitant trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were supposed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, who exports large-scale agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed workers, farm owners and businesses.
China, Branstad said in a statement in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, is now doubling this tyranny by posting propaganda ads in its own free press in the United States.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is claiming the tradition of free speech and independent press, proven in America, by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, you will find only a limited number of dissenting voices at the newsstands here in Beijing, and you will not find any real reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese might have about China's troubling economic development, given that the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of China’s best-known newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but did not mention the newspaper’s name.
Republicans Disguise Women Voters Before Midterm Elections With Kavanaugh Debacle, Observers Warn
As many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of multiple allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, which could emanate from women in particular.
The mood in this regard has been extremely tense, and most Republicans have already reported that they are moving forward with a vote.
“Such things cannot be undone,” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University’s The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that the last-minute push by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation is enough to appease angry voters.
"Women don't forget what was yesterday, they don't forget it tomorrow and not even in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters in the hallways of the Senate shouted “November is coming!” when the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to hold on to Kavanaugh’s nomination, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, people between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, observers suggested that a backlash could result if Republicans advance confirmation.
“This situation is a mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the panel voting, the final vote, or Kavanaugh’s review; it’s also about the way Republicans handled it and how they handled it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, told the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to be at odds over who they should believe based on the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger proportion on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford’s statement, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying about his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s printing, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford made an affidavit to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that she was assaulted by drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his genitals to her when they were at a party during her college days at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to oppose Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the goal of establishing competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee argued that the intention behind Inrupt was “world domination.”
“We need to take action now,” he said on the topic of startups.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology, allowing users to create their own personal online data store or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other tools for the home and business sectors.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is in one browser and available at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data store is that the user can decide alone who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal reinforcement and development over data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is for the company to use resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers hired to work on this project, a community of volunteer programmers, and an IBM-acquired security platform.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not discuss with Facebook and Google whether to make a major change that will completely reshape their entire business models overnight.
“We’re not asking for your permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt is tasked with providing commercial power generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee reshaped the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been instrumental in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, recipient of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only Church of England clergyman to have been awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter, was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award for his service in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Sunday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, felt that this act was full of symbolic power, as the memorial stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the feat for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918; through thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
Later, he advanced to the Fire Line and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before he single-handedly advanced with a field weapon and took out three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot dead by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were something he could never do justice to, and at the same time something that makes you humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a wreath after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he is honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero is made visible above all by the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed up all night watching an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the audience in the UK were not in a bad mood when suddenly Peppa Pig was seen.
Some remained untouched after staying awake until the early hours of the morning to specifically watch the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the move to the cartoon character as a somehow bad joke.
"Due to government regulation, this content is classified as juvenile, so it had to be switched to a children's show at 6 a.m.," Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The company’s chief executive officer at Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company will be working on the schedule to accommodate viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think the problem could already be solved during the replay,” he said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on a Sunday with viewers in the UK, and we won’t resolve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stick to it.
There was a lot of communication during the change, it was quite a mess and it was not always nice.
We tried to solve the problem and assumed it was a technical malfunction.
That was not the case, it was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We’re going to reduce it to 5 fights instead of 6 as usual, and we’ve tried to give the fans the best possible experience.
The whole situation is quite unfortunate."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Inferior’ to Sexuality
Tom Daley, who has competed as a water jumper at various Olympic Games, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized in secondary school that he is different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the victories at the Olympic Games are no longer so important to him.
The actual host of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne’s first broadcast, he said that he used to consider himself inferior compared to others, as love for boys and girls was socially totally unacceptable.
“To this day, the feeling of being inferior to others and different from others is a reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he is a very special personality, so as not to disappoint anyone if his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medalist at the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he had spoken on the subject because fortunately he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and would like to encourage others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, and the realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise to him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference had never been an issue.
He says that when you had to go through so much as a child and teenager – he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time when he was 14 and his father died three years later of cancer, it is hard to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
The couple has had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley says his entire point of view has changed since then.
Last year, it was all about gold medals.
But for him, there are now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main prize.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the approaching death, and one of the last things he asked for were the tickets to London in 2012, as he wanted to be at the front of the pack.
“I couldn’t tell him he wasn’t there anymore,” he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
“All I knew was that it was always my dream to dive in front of a local audience at the Olympics – that was madness,” he said.
His first selection of songs – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by this, and he heard the song in the run-up to the Olympic Games and still gave it goosebumps.

Mickelson, who is currently out of shape, sits on the back bench at Saturday’s Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he will have to work hard to make sure it doesn’t become a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the substitute bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as is usually the case, the five-time major winner spent his day cheering on others and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that were bothering him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus not an ideal cast for the tight Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the course itself wasn’t daunting enough, Mickelson will face perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday’s ninth game, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, a newcomer to these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans hit a hot start with four points behind in the 12 singles games, Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to it.
“He was completely clear about his role today, patted me on the back and put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world famous personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn’t think he was going to play two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s how it went and that’s what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else.”
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldo record for the most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite matched the high points of his personal record.
Mickelson recorded 18 wins, suffered 20 defeats and reached seven halves, although Furyk announced that his presence alone has enriched the team.
“He’s funny and sarcastic, original, and likes to make a few jokes, and he’s a great person who’s popular with the whole team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little bit more this week, and it was fun to watch them.
He’s a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses.”
Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that the lead may soon be over
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead that leads to the final individual matches in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but only just crossed the finish line and took the lead with the smallest possible lead, scoring a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 victory.
“The thought remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just barely,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn (pictured) after seeing victory 5–3 of the Class of 2018 both Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it is not over.
Tomorrow it's going really well.
Do your best and do the right thing.
The whole thing is over only when the dots are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and that’s where our focus is.
I’ve always said I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re fully aware of what’s facing us on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Commenting on the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never rush this.
Tomorrow will be a different calibre.
Tomorrow the focus will be on individual services and that is a completely different matter.
It’s great to work with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re being tested to the limits of your skills as a golfer.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to get the best out of himself too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will make sure his players do better individually than on the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those big turnarounds on the final day of the tournament, and he was on the winning side in Brookline before he was on the losing side after Europe's "Miracles of Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word," he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to pull off the quick start you’ve seen in Brookline and Medinah.
If momentum beats in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our team accordingly and send our guys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task to make a counterattack, he has to compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as more Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
"I chose the guys in that order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said of his selection for the individual encounters.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The newest German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but it won’t be delivered until next year, according to local media, due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the brand-new frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time that called for a military spokesman.
The ship should have been commissioned in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by worrying problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and sea target missiles, as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the newest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays may mean that the state-of-the-art warships, which are supposed to represent Germany as a naval power, will already be obsolete at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
The unlucky frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to take the ship off and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware errors" that would have rendered the new ship unusable in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, since ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also become known that the ship is far too heavy, which leads to performance losses and prevents the Navy from carrying out armament measures in the future.
The 7000 tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class, which were used by Germany in the Second World War.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the crew’s training costs, also became a problem.
Apparently, costs rose to a staggering €3.1 billion, compared to the €2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Defence Commissioner of the German Bundestag, confirmed that the navy was "running out of operational ships".
Bartels said the problem got bigger over time, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships had been provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken away by the navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Lives of Bats
New research is being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Highlands to show how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The findings are hoped to provide further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track dwarf and mosquito bats as well as the brown long-eared and water bats at Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed in key positions on the property to record the activities of the bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
A noise analysis of all recordings by experts determines the frequency of the bat calls and determines which species does what.
A map and habitat report are then created to provide a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This data will help determine the benefits of habitat management measures, such as the creation of meadows, and show how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, just like flycatchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across Scotland, takes the bat issue very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organisation has even established Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s 10 bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
“Here in Threave, we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats yet, so we’re doing this work here and on other goods that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable.”
He stresses the importance of first excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and juveniles and wipe out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nesting sites.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the local community to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about bats, and many of our species we don’t know about their populations.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as his lawyers seek to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described allegations of rape against him as “fake news” and said that people want to “be famous” by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The striker of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly then paid her $375,000 to buy her silence on the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video of his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports “fake news” just hours after their release.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today is fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
You want to be famous by my name, but that’s part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they described as “improper reporting on privacy-related suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player claimed compensation for “moral damage at a level equal to the severity of the violation, which is believed to be one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was “99 percent a good guy” who succumbed to “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that the two had sex, but say it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos taken of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “afraid of retaliation” and worried about being “publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to lift the deal as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident, switching to Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: The UK would ‘ever regret’ the loss of automakers
The UK would “regret forever” if it lost its post-Brexit status as a world leader in car manufacturing, according to Economy Secretary Greg Clark.
He said it was “worrying” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily suspend production at the Burnaston plant at Derby if the UK left the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis product lines, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will experience production stops at our plant in the event of an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a hard exit from the EU without an agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to the automakers, are related to risks within the supply chain in a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s manufacturing facility operates on a “just-in-time” basis, meaning parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to make the cars to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without an agreement, there could be disruptions at the borders, which the industry says could lead to delays and bottlenecks in parts.
It is impossible for Toyota to maintain a stock at the Derbyshire plant that will last more than a day, the company said, explaining why production needs to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa May’s Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid such checks at the border.”
"We need a deal. We want the best deal, which, as I said, allows us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in the Today broadcast of BBC Radio 4.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains that have been so far.”
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest-ranking member of the Unite union at the plant, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs never come back once they are gone.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week" as the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's dispute continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein has overseen the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s election interference, ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, as well as a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the deputy justice minister and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein raised the possibility of secretly recording his talks with Trump as well as impeaching the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, as new reports of his supposed resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN General Assembly in New York at the time, was announced for next Thursday,
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid conflicting with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set for this, it could be this week, but I can also imagine it being postponed for another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
That will show up, but I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably contradict this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences does not indicate an aversion to the "effectual hesitancy" of TV reporters, but admitted: "I wouldn't deny that they do effectual hesitancy."
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president is making more question-and-answer rounds than any president before him,” she said, without providing any precise evidence: “We looked at these numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it will be far better than talking to me.
We try to do this a lot and you’ve seen that we’ve done this a lot in the last few weeks, and that’s going to take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is the case when he gave an out-of-control, and sometimes bizarre, appearance in front of assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers of the Scottish NHS over Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health addresses people from other EU countries who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and the wish that they remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the cost of applying for residence permits for EU citizens working in Scotland’s decentralised civil service.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, exit negotiations between the UK and the EU continued and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know what a troubling time this must be for all of you.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is fully your home and we would be delighted if you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie was subjected to emergency surgery, according to Tennessee State's Mike Organ, after a head injury he sustained on Saturday in the 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the Tennessee State head coach, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time break.
"He came to the sidelines and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the sidelines before he was placed on a stretcher and transported away for further examination.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie left the OR at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details are known about the nature or extent of the injury,” and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called redshirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after moving over from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, bringing his total to 18 tackles in the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp duty to buy property in the UK
Investors from abroad will have to raise a higher stamp duty for the purchase of property in the UK in the future. The additional revenue is expected to benefit the homeless according to the Conservative Party’s new plans
This step aims to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp duty will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenue of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp duty if you buy property in the UK, with the increased revenue to benefit homeless people.
This move represents an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters, who promise to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be applied to individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and will be added to the government’s campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current stamp duty and including the increase introduced two years ago on second homes and residential properties left for rent, could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the move to generate additional revenue of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by investors who are not based in the United Kingdom, thus driving up prices and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to gain a foothold in the real estate business.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, became "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new strategy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to allow more young people to own their first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain’s “housing shame.”
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a startling series of housing reform proposals, ranging from a rent freeze to banning evictions for no good reason.
He also wants to give city councillors more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, according to which life would get better from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life for themselves.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for non-UK residents as it is for companies based abroad to buy real estate as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of owning a home has become too remote for too many people and the unworthiness of homelessness remains too big a problem.”
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the chief executive of Sunderland, says his “biggest goal” is to eventually become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of breathing new life into the club from the north-east of England, which is currently in third place in League One and which lacks three points to the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bench and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I’ve often seen Scotland play in Hampden with my father as a kid and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in club management."
Ross's predecessors in the role as Sunderland's manager include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of such established names at such a club, having previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My success will be measured by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and opportunities in this club, he belongs to the Premier League without a doubt,” he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only consider my time here a success if I bring the club back there."
Ross has a management career of only three years, following a period as deputy boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month coaching career at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and helped St. Mirren from the edge of relegation to win the championship the following season.
Ross says he is now more comfortable than ever in his playing career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"That was a real crossroads," he recalls when he took over the responsibility from Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more so than playing.
It sounds funny, because I did not do a bad job, was able to live from it well and experienced some very pleasant climaxes.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I’m still going through this in terms of the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, and I've never felt so comfortable in my skin in my whole adult life."

The summer heat wave has seen a surge in revenue from Britain’s crippling pubs as restaurant chains come under greater pressure.
Pub and bar businesses saw revenue growth of 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin from CGA, which compiled the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected attendance at the World Cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to the previous June in which pubs saw sales increase by 2.8 percent, but the restaurant hit even harder.
The 1.8% decline recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed by far the best performance, with a flat-rate sales development that rose higher than it did in restaurants.
Pubs focusing on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastically as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent in the month, while food sales decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, of the RSM leisure and hospitality industry analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant groups will continue to struggle with problems, but revenue losses of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly painful in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators of companies with a focus on food and it remains to be seen whether the more moderate temperatures in August will provide the much-needed breathing space.”
Overall revenue growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand rollouts.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One study shows that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that they keep secret from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools found an increase in so-called "fake insta" pages
The news fuels fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main account" to show to their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that it can keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "fake insta" accounts, a nod to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news fuels fears that sexual content is being shared.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main account" that they can show to their parents, but they also had private accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who told others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistress’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are being tricked into creating online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle Becomes ‘Athletic Voice’ in Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council at its annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most awarded athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from her far-reaching international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that Scotland's athletics would greatly benefit from their election to the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I look forward to serving as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, owns a total of four Olympic gold medals and now frequently appears as a BBC expert, was unable to walk after a temporary circulatory disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say that no one can tell if or how far I will recover.
It was hard work, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for breast pumps that compares mothers to cows causes excitement on the web
A manufacturer of breast pumps caused excitement on the net with an advertising clip comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
On the market launch of the "world's first low-noise portable breast pump", consumer technology manufacturer Elvie released a not-so-serious music video to emphasize the freedom the pump gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that contains lines of text such as, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see a tail on me" or "if you didn't notice, these are not udders but my breasts."
“Pump it out, pump it out, I’ll feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I’ll milk my ladies.”
However, the advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page has sparked controversy on the net.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video met with mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it downplays the dairy industry’s “frights.”
“It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their young will be taken away from them within a few days of birth," the statement said.
The breast pump by Elvie fits discreetly into a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment read: “Comprehensibly traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added, “Such a non-realistic advertisement.”
Others defended the commercial, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was hilarious.
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping, I felt exactly like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I’m not trying to over-interpret it.
This is a brilliant product,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use breast pumps (often in the workplace or on toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use breast pumps claim to feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and discreetly fits into a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast pumps and all the challenges they faced, while at the same time introducing the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump makes possible in an entertaining and comprehensible way.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump has hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski saw a mother of two appear on the catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of migrant children interned is higher than ever before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, including as intensified rhetoric and measures by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves have been illegal immigrants and are now afraid of becoming the target of deportation themselves if they sign up to take in a child.
The risk increased in June when federal agencies announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had applied to care for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who are either themselves carers or members of a carer’s household reside illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are delinquent foreigners.
That’s why we will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In order to deal with the cases of the children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules, which, according to the staff of the accommodations, requires some children to appear in court within a month instead of 60 days after the detention, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear by video call and not in person to stand before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the case of negative decisions, the person is quickly deported.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or breakout attempts, according to the accommodation staff, as well as reports that have come out of the system in the last month.
Defenders say these concerns are amplified at a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there are signs that a child is having trouble being overlooked more easily due to size.
They also explained that trauma, which many of the children already suffer from, can be amplified if they are taken to a tent city without emotional preparation or sufficient time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria urges American, French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country’s civil war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, stated that the foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil with the pretext of fighting terrorism and would be “treated accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have been evicted from their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus "will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has stationed about 2,000 troops in Syria, training and advising mainly both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs hired against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return are in place and he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that prevent refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make the return home possible," he said.
“They are politicizing a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warned that no reconstruction aid would be granted to Syria unless there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats at the UN said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib represents an opportunity for advancing political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad-based offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military action will be taken against jihadists, including fighters of the al-Qaeda-allied Nusra Front, which will be “eradicated.”
U.N. Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem cited the Syrian government’s conditions for participation in the committee, stating that its work should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal onlookers presumably hope, an impeachment or scandal prematurely end his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of any presidency ever".
So far, there is no sign that the spectators are tired.
Since 2014, CNN’s best-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC’s ratings have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reached an average of 2.4 million viewers at prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped the ratings with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
“It’s like a fire that magically attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, showrunner of the ABC drama series Designated Survivor, about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
The chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything on television, the stories from Washington can determine the future of policy decisions on abortion Roe v. Wade, the possible merging of families, and the health of the global economy.
Turning it off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen, if one becomes aware of having already watched six hours of a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s use of sources from the so-called “deep background” for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-leather bomber jacket (according to the Washington Post, a “piece of clothing rich in overestimation”) or the effects of Stormy Daniel’s reamen.
I will never be able to see Super Mario with the same eyes again.
“Part of what he does makes it feel like a reality show that he puts on you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, chief executive officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series “The Three from the Pawn Shop,” about Trump’s rotating cast and daily turns of events (breaking a dispute with the NFL football league, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t afford to miss an episode, otherwise you won’t get along.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the northern coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crawled inside and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He just couldn’t get away from the screen, not when judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows back then and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Donations flooded the closest races for seats in Congress in the midterm elections
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th electoral district is flooded with donations, thanks to the newly-drawn boundaries of the electoral districts, which resulted in two incumbents running for the same seat.
Pittsburg’s newly redrawn suburban district pits Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election the previous spring.
Lamb takes on another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties violated the Constitution and were manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a clash of campaign finance between the parties’ major financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a much-noticed special election in March around the state's 18th electoral district.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade, and Trump won there by 20 percentage points.
Politicians give Democrats easy leadership.
The US tried to punish El Salvador for its support for China, but then withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump completed a friendly meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners threw out the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to remove the heads of all U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Department of State spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, thought was given to punitive measures, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed punitive measures, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity that was to follow a similar gathering the previous year and represented a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving toward the US.
However, in mid-September, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending the consideration of punitive measures for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October to signal, according to diplomats, the importance that the government is giving to the Assembly.
The three American diplomatic representatives have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh communications or punitive measures from Washington.
A government spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to comment on the internal meetings on condition of anonymity.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learning from history
The next big surprise could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, for which there is now sufficient evidence in public.
Mueller is now also reportedly investigating whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If the Congressional majority changes, Trump would be faced with an organ that would hold him accountable at the very moment he rides past to stand in front of the voters again; and possibly in front of a jury.
That’s a lot of ‘ifs’ and I don’t want to say that the case of Donald Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup d’état against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed a chance to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The United States is facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who will decide the future of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in Teufel’s kitchen since this paper reported last year that he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about whether he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein denies the New York Times representation.
“How will we respond if the newly ordered FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony in office?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, we have a long winter ahead of us.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about this legacy?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of game against Vienna
The Rangers will receive Rapid Wien on Thursday, knowing that a win against the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villareal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a good position for qualifying for Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear until the 2-2 draw against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger ones.
"That was an important point for us because Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can make something out of it and we went home with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we struggled in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we’ll get three points, but it’s going to be a tough game because they got a good result in the last game, but I’m sure we can do that with the audience behind us and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of feel-good factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of retirement leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in Nationwide’s study said to talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t take the necessary steps to have the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance division.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t express your desires in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid capital-forming life insurance to help cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own assets—as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Resolve last-minute litigation.
Set up a preventive power of attorney so that you hire a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that health care professionals comply with your wishes, should you be unable to express them yourself.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills get paid if you are unable to.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the financial issues that matter. Who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What is the drug treatment?”
Who takes care of the dog?
You have already completed this plan.”
Man in Ilfracombe repeatedly shot at with air rifle
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he went home after working among friends.
The victim, a man in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting at around 2:30 a.m. British time as an "arbitrary act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
Due to the failure of communication systems, aid workers were unable to obtain information from the government district of Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a administrative district that extends in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi over a coastline of over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
In 2017, an estimated 299,200 people lived in the administrative district, an administrative unit below the province.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of Central Sulawesis, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it mainly focuses on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Civil Protection Agency.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996 that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, nearly half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake shook southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake shook one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A minor earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya government district in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but over 100 people died from collapsing buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, popular with tourists, killing more than 500 people, especially on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and former vice-presidential candidate, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence reporting, and resistance to state violence, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska Police.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone from an acquaintance when she wanted to call the police.
Palin is in pretrial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility, according to KTUU, and a $500 bail was raised.
He appeared in court on Saturday where, when asked about his plea, he responded with “Not guilty, quite sure,” according to the network.
Palin is accused of committing three Class A misdemeanors, punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor charge that can be fined one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before Alaska’s Veteran’s Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting a crime, and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans’ organizations in 2016 after she attributed her son’s behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder following his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are disrupted and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of central Sulawesis, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the moment the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutor calls for rare death penalty for suspects in New York terror attack
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York is calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terror attack, which cost eight lives. This is a rare sentence that has not been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a rented pick-up from the Home Depot hardware store chain for a terrorist attack in the course of which he raced on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, bypassing pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "targeted" the eight ofers and "consciously" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the memorandum of understanding for the death penalty demand filed in the southern New York district.
Both charges could be punished with death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigative jury in Saipov filed a 22-point indictment that included eight counts of murder against the background of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as an indictment of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "fundamental planning and intent," according to the prosecutors, who described the way in which Saipov carried out the act as "disgusting, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov inflicted damage, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the Southern District of New York has not pursued a case seeking the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York on a federal offense was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been convicted two years earlier of conspiring to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified to a lack of remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators to feel good about what he did, according to police.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to do the act after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also called for the ISIS flag to be hung in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to call for the death penalty, instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a life sentence without possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma that all involved suffer," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP calls for NIGEL FARAGE to hand over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize “the power of the people” today during a protest at the Tory Conference.
Ukip’s former party leader said politicians “must feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May’s party suggested Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be “already out” if Farage were Brexit minister.
The challenge May faces in reconciling her deeply divided side has been exacerbated by the fact that members of her party who are in favour of remaining in the EU took part in a separate demonstration against Brexit, which took place in the city.
The prime minister has problems keeping her compromise plan Chequers on track despite attacks by Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that despite the backlash, she should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to choose between their package and the “chaos”.
Bone explained at the ‘Leave Means Leave’ demonstration in Solihull that ‘Chequers belong in the garbage’.
He suggested that Farage should have been named a peer and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would be out,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: ‘I will stand up for Brexit, but Chequers belongs on the garbage.’
Stressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
The Brexit supporter of conservatives Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration, telling reporters: ‘I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public eye, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and in our activists, who actually walk through the streets and ensure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp message to May, she continued, “Prime Minister will keep their jobs if you keep their promises.”
Farage said in a speech that politicians “must feel the pressure” if they are in the process of cheating on the 2016 referendum decision.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“They’re trying to cheat Brexit, and that’s why we’re here today to tell them, ‘You can’t get away with it.’
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he went on to say: “I want you to let our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country, which helped us to win the referendum and will never calm down, as long as we are not an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May’s party that was launched over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories, who had security problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the smooth border, for free trade without borders, are in place in Ireland,” Adonis said.
“This is a farce.
There is simply no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to ‘Exaggerate’ Presidential Candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, she would “examine the presidential candidacy closely.”
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for re-election to the Senate against Massachusetts Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was vice chairman of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She was the center of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the people present asked her if she wanted to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to “go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes women at the top.”
LSU player Sims arrested after being shot to death
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the case of fatal shots fired at LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man seen on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result of this injury," Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told the media on Saturday, according to the sports media portal 247sports.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene and possessing a gun and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starting lines last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Championship title after team gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes’ stable order would play a major role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from pole position and it was almost as if he was leading Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first went into the pits and let Hamilton push into the traffic at the end of the driver’s field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits a lap later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a tight wheel-to-wheel maneuver in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly released the inside of the pit at the risk of holding out after two moves to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in one of the back places of the field and was in seventh place on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for much of the race as he held on to his tyres to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally entered the pits in the 44th round and failed to make a step in the remaining eight laps, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day as Valtteri did an excellent job the whole weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to let me in.
The team has done an excellent job of achieving a one-two win,” said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a campaign event on Saturday, insisting that she did not pass on Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, the President did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that the Senate proceedings show that people are “common, malicious, and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that’s happened in the Senate in the last few days, is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and vicious and dishonest,” he said.
“If you look at the leaks and you say, ‘Oh, I wasn’t.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... published the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a moment, please.
Did we... No, we didn't publish it," he added, imitating the senator's voice.
Feinstein was leaked the letter with Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and it was released in early September, but Feinstein denies that the leak came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not publish your story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret, and I complied with her request for secrecy."
Her denial didn’t seem to go down well with the president, who said on Saturday night at the campaign event: “I’ll tell you one thing, that was very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continuous defense of the judge candidate, who is accused of sexual assault by three women, claimed the Democrats would use the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to retake power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the malice, they don’t care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants by a 5-3 win in the return leg at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants went early with two goals in the lead, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win with two goals.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe, who unexpectedly beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, the third defeat in the Elite League of the season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a submission by Kendall McFaull, and four minutes later David Rutherford provided the submission when Beauvillier stepped up the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie to his equalising gate after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the Giants’ lead before the half-time break as he scored his second goal of the evening just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again equalised with a power play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half, then Nielsen secured his team's victory with a fifth goal after just under half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home next Friday at Milton Keynes Stadium.
Air traffic controller died after he made sure hundreds of people on a plane escaped the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he found the death to have a plane with hundreds of people on board safely take off.
Over 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was rocked on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues have fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was collapsing.
Agung later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Indonesia’s air safety service, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia’s ABC News.
“We have deployed a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply saddened by this news," he added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to several thousand, the country’s civil protection agency said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to increase as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached," Sutopo spokesperson Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday, explaining in a speech to the country’s military: “I ask you to work all day and night to complete all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Since you're ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia has already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year, in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini Reportedly Missing After Plane Crash in Lagoon
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they cannot say anything about the whereabouts of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it would work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but were in stable condition.
The cause and exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very flat.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others could wade through hip-deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working nearby to improve a dock rushed to the rescue with an inflatable boat to bring people to shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 people were killed in crashes by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the sequence of the night a woman was burned alive
The indictment concluded on Saturday their argument in the retrial of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The US Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone calls to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her death night.
Rowlett said he received position data from various cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, contradicting his previous statements, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke with Sanford.
Sanford entered the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he had been in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said he had lied "since my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks at the time of her death.
However, cell phone records indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted their messages, calls, and contact information from his cell phone.
"He's taken her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will then go before the jury on that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
Bristol-based The High Breed claim that hip hop has moved away from its roots of political message and social engagement.
They want to go back to his roots and make socially conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after she received a misdirected message from the mother complaining that she was “still a black man.”
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to a “blackmail.”
Two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed dismay when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first day at work in 2016.
"NO EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After recognizing her faux pas, the “embarrassed” Plasco flaxman dismissed Maurice, claiming that the outgoing African-American surrogate had done a poor job and was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her workday and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal and claiming compensation for the $350 per day she spent over six months in the job she was originally booked for, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t do that,” she told the paper on Friday, “I know that’s discrimination.”
The pair rejected the racism allegations, arguing that the dismissal was the reasonable step, as they feared Maurice, after insulting them, would no longer be able to trust them.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to “extortion” and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was “in a difficult situation.”
“You want to care about such a person?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
As the lawsuit continues, the couple was quickly convicted in public and denounced on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers won’t identify with a talking bear, a new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in someone’s shoes reading it for the first time before it was published.
Today it's very funny with our knowledge of Paddington's huge success today."
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a little toy bear to write the children’s book, would have had no problem with it had his work been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of its release after his death last year was “bittersweet.”
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington’s success, which she describes as “a very important family member.”
"He was a very quiet man and didn't brag," said Jankel.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child doing something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although he invented and created it, he always blamed Paddington for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it looks really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got the call from Nad telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly subsided and left her body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I could do nothing but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to pull myself together.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers, who did not notice what she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had my head down and tears running down my cheeks all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women hang up cards to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are trying to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers for counselling centres.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to have to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son was about to have a promising career as a chef and he had an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could brighten up a room."
However, he quit his job before his death because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s body was found after the suicide of his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: "I'm always afraid that this could have a consequential effect."
Davis designed the cards “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent: you have to talk about it.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was together for 15 years shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt down or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom, and when the kids unpacked their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that it had to go through: “It tears a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future in limbo as FBI begins investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get what he was asking for, a time-limited investigation, then maybe we could get a little harmony," Flake said on Saturday, fearing that the committee would "disintegrate" in the partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an investigation by the FBI?
Their reluctance can be traced back to the timing alone.
The midterm elections on November 6 are only five weeks away, and if Republicans did poorly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush grabbed the phone to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It’s still unclear whether Kavanaugh can garner at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to decide on a tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors ‘sin’ under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Reunification Ministry, stated that 1127 defectors were registered last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park cited tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher prices of people-smuggling as the main factors.
Pyongyang did not speak out publicly.
The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often returns them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang to discuss the halted denuclearization negotiations.
This was the result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, at which they generally agreed to work towards a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without being able to rely on the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm unilaterally at first," Mir Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and says he's not fit for Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not deny the impression that a woman who had acted in this way would have been described as 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and about to burst into tears as he talked about his family and his high school days.
He has also explicitly denounced the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated creed” organized by liberals angry about Hillary Clinton’s lost 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proves he can’t serve on the Supreme Court, as it shows he is biased toward Democrats.
"I believe that with these statements and the way in which he went about the Clintons and the Democrats, he has declared himself unfit," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office should he be confirmed and the Democrats win the House majority.
“I’m going to say so much: if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judge post,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi said she, as a Democrat, is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion principle decision Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether he would revise certain Supreme Court decisions.
“We don’t need a hysterical, biased person going to this court and expecting us to say, ‘Oh, that’s not wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It’s a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcooking anger and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also cried when she got angry, but developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts crying, say to the person she was talking to: “You might think that’s sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then just keep talking.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a man-dominated office, where one day I cried because of an indescribable rage and was grabbed by the collar and dragged into a stairwell by an elderly woman, a super-cooled manager, who I was always a little afraid of.
“Don’t ever let her see you cry,” she told me.
“You don’t know you’re stinky.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with themselves, as they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder pondered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidacy himself.
“That was not a well thought out decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the election campaign was already advanced, she was behind in raising funds and vowed not to run if she did not get $2 million together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, only supported her campaign with $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she asked herself.
In her speech, in which she announced that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration at the system that made raising funds and addressing voters directly instead of delegates so difficult, as well as anger at sexism that she was close to tears.
"One could have assumed that I suffered a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
"She was crying?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the US-China trade war
The opening salvos of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening. Although the battle is far from over, Beijing could benefit from a long-term rift between countries, experts say.
Donald Trump, the American president, fired the first warning shot earlier this year when he imposed punitive tariffs on major Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new punitive tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China into the US.
Beijing struck back in the same way every time, recently imposing punitive tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China vowed to respond to any U.S. action, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will soon stumble.
To persuade Washington to give in would mean to give in, but a public crackdown on the US would be far too shameful for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously realized," says Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is 'ready' to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by the seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure," he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomed aid in rebuilding the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that it would not accept conditional assistance from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the US.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over much of the tournament, sank his tee shot on the 16th track (Par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5-4 by the lowest ranking player in Team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world’s best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against England’s Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so infinitely happy to win the cup back.
It’s about the team and I’m happy to have made a contribution,” said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch on to his compatriot John Rahm, who won against the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in the individual encounters.
I'm so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, whom I've watched on TV since I was a kid," Rahm said.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and is surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA had trouble finding the fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have achieved top performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of the guys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We didn't do anything about it.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players did a good job.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We were defeated."
