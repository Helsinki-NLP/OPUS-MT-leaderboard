No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected the request to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko had been sentenced, as part of a amendment to the Criminal Code.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned Minister of Foreign Affairs, was rejected by the MEPs at the second reading of the request to mitigate the penalties for economic offenses.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for entering into an allegedly detrimental contract with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, in December the appeal of the convicts is to be tried in court.
Timoshenko himself describes the verdict as political revenge of the regime and also in the West the trial raised suspicions of bias of the court.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Minister of Foreign Affairs was convicted, from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 deputies.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners have to be defined.
As is customary in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which ones - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council professed the customary law of the Shari'ah, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft one chops off the hand in short.
Women should also forget about emancipation as soon as possible, possible apostates are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society of mutually contending tribes will be united by the Koran in the future.
In short, there will be an order in Libya that would be hardly imaginable in this country and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans variety.
In this regard, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters even allowed themselves to be helped by the unbelieving dogs.
Their only excuse may be the fact that NATO’s airstrikes were not directed by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The victors in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only participated in a shootout, served the interests of Islam and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without this having brought any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
This causes a concern for the locals - namely, the expulsion of the crusaders.
But do the oil companies also get the black gold at a mock price without occupation?
The West can hardly boast of its selflessness when it comes to the protection of human rights.
If they do not, they will be destroyed by the Shariah.
The Beginning of a New Crisis Era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm blew through Europe.
The individual countries published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, while Germany and France grew.
The bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are not only keeping an eye on Greece, but now also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and several other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
As expected, Germany’s GDP grew by 0.5%, France’s by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of forecast 0.1%), while France acknowledged a slight decline of 0.1% (original data spoke only of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, gross domestic product stagnated and according to the Statistical Office, the trend of the slowdown in economic performance was thus confirmed.
The results are worse than the analysts’ forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally overcalculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Across the eurozone and the EU, the economy grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy contracted by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield from their 10-year government bonds climbed to 28.45%.
The yield on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also starting to feel problems...
The yield on Czech government bonds is below 4%, even though the situation in the region is worsening.
In Germany, voices are being raised that the ECB should become the creditor of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the hardest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a good goalkeeper <0xC4><0x8C>ech and a magnificent goal by Petr Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, she won 1-0 in Montenegro.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will once again not be missing at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the promotion game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won 1-0 thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant <0xC4><0x8C>ech's and the hero of the day Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek in Montenegro and has thus redeemed their ticket for the European Football Championship.
Also because of the precise defensive game of the Czech team, they were able to put the Montenegrins under more pressure only in the second half.
The bad luck birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who lost two huge chances.
Thanks also to an excellent Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech selection will participate in the European championships next year, it is also pleasing that a premium of about 200 million euros is added to the domestic football.
From the first minutes, quite a combative football was played.
Both teams combined for a long time and so was played mainly around the middle line.
In the second half, the pressure of the home team remained and the wide shots in front of the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred college students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country’s core program ahead of a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object on Tuesday noon and then announced the death to the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from the university in Isfahan, Iran, formed a living shield around the core technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed, on Tuesday.
They wanted to make it clear that they are ready to protect their country’s core programme, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has apparently not given up on its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, talks about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed in front of the entrance to the complex at noon and then announced the death to the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack with the intention of paralyzing the Iranian nuclear program to the greatest possible extent, according to the Israeli press from the center in Isfahan would also be the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan's target.
The menu of a fatty child: It does not have breakfast and eats sausage for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important the environment in which a person grows up is for healthy development and the examples that surround him are.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families in which normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had French fries for dinner on the eve of the awareness campaign under the motto "Adiposity is not a coincidence".
In families with fatties, sport is not one of their favorite activities, which also affects the majority of today's students - only 15 percent responded that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic being interviewed.
This was already the second year of the "Adiposity is not a coincidence" campaign, which is supported by the Allgemeine Krankenkasse and the Unilever company.
To date, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th grades have participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are decisive factors that are responsible for the frighteningly increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"For example, only half of the children surveyed said they ate breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesper-evening five times a day - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative trifles, such as the family’s regular breakfast time, are important for a child’s healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the families of the students eat breakfast.
And in most families, everyone eats breakfast on their own.
Worst of all was the finding that in one in ten families, there was no breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test showed, among other things, that in the families of overweight children you consume unhealthy fries much more often.
And almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed exercise, only less than half of their parents do – only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to put together their own meal plan based on opportunities offered according to appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite dishes were many pastries, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"The great popularity of sweet lemonades is alarming in particular," the final report on this survey emphasizes.
At lunch, the main dish, pasta won just before poultry.
Legumes the children almost did not like and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes for lunch was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In many cases, the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the conclusion of the enlightening lecture "Adiposity is not a coincidence", there was a marked shift in preferences towards principles of healthy nutrition," the results of the project are cited.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also checked poultry or fish much more often in the questionnaire as the main course of the day and were willing to eat less dumplings or sweet foods.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I had a bit of a muffled feeling that this was a bit too much stuff to start with.
I didn’t know in the slightest what was to come.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" works.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the exam gets, the more information and practical tasks we have to deal with.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully booked.
This time we debated with director Alena (not a single man participates in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
After all, most of us are.
Some have a too short neck, the others a too boyish figure without proper curves and still others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually conceal wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a woman like Jennifer Lopez - with a big bust, wide hip and narrow waist - pretty and figure-hugging, without making her seem too provocative.
For example, if the difference between the waist and hips is so big that the skirt or pants really do not fit, you should at least have a piece tailor-made.
You will not regret it, because well-fitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in a bar that always slips up and down, stands out at the waist, etc.
Boyish figures can in turn allow themselves to wear clothing with pleats, puffs, appliques, embroidery or gathering.
With this amount of information and figure types, I’m glad that I have a whole week to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I am afraid that it is almost impossible in view of the assigned homework.
Each of the course participants was assigned a celebrity, for which she should come up with suitable outfits - daywear and evening gown.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and his figure type.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, whom you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I cheer inside, because that’s much better for me personally than, for example, wearing Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably gained a hundred kilos recently (well, that’s a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the garments out of magazines or search the internet, print them out and then edit them graphically.
In the "moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
Stylist and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k told us about this.
But not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about figure types, was immediately seasoned by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a skilled stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual over the jeans, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heels and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or the collar and the whole look looks completely different.
“Play with it,” he said.
But the most important advice to me was: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," said Jakub.
I finally realize why we have to cram all these teachings, what you can combine with what and why, even if you often get to see completely different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared many more clothing variants than he ultimately photographs.
So for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) you have to be prepared to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to expect all this in the design of the outfit.
Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> also confirmed that image and style sometimes account for half of the success.
All you have to do is look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Even well-known personalities often think this is money thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something that I look like is secondary).
And if anyone can be styled by us, then we should expect that he or she will most likely impose on us a completely different (smaller) size than he or she actually needs.
Then you only need to google afterwards, in order to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes, the corresponding celebrity has again increased or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario told us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "assemble" the outfit.
In his work, he has to communicate primarily with the people he styles and he has to be a smart psychologist.
Assessing people without indulging in and standing up for his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to sift through her closet and add some pretty pieces, we can't just clear out the whole closet and say, 'Oh, my God, that's awful.'
“You have to find at least a few commendable things to recommend what you can wear,” says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what such a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So this is a bag that you button on at the waist and in which you carry all the necessary proprieties with you.
In addition to such clear items as scissors, hair removal dispensers or safety pins, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (this helps the stylist to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are gathered at the back, if it is too large (pins or other clamps are prohibited, so that the fabric does not break, of course).
But in order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly slip on shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is level, you can damage the sole of the shoe, let alone the outside.
O we were glued and glued...
With the scissors you can not even touch the shoes, so that you do not damage them.
So you have to be really skillful.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All of this was just a fraction of what we got to hear at the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - to devote oneself to styling on a professional level is no child’s play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Rezension
The initially carefree journey becomes an early-shift routine through a series of completely avoidable, dilettantic errors.
It was possible to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent, but what use is that, when obviously nobody wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the counters, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
He promised to move the already old game series "Need for Speed" again a piece into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the fitting passages, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are already used to with NFS, in the end, much is different than you expected.
Sure - potentially quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is tempered by some superfluous flaws that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So they are actually no longer mistakes, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, you are introduced to the story, whose main character Jack has certain problems of a personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you sit at the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting milieus.
One does not have a moment’s impression that the game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are also very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the drive through the desert, through autumnal landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape seems visually very pleasant.
From time to time, atypical elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm, which severely restricts the view.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to take care that you are not spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in succession.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police are also intervening, who want to screw up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer such passages in the game than one would expect (in concrete terms, probably only three).
In the end, this is more of an advantage, because at least this element has no chance of getting boring - it is one of the elements that make the game more varied in the context of the above.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the preceding parts.
That is, from today's point of view, it does not tear out trees, on the other hand, one could not claim that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But the local driving model continues to do quite well for an action-packed racing, although you could find better ones in the competition.
Until then, everything is in perfect order.
Real problems only appear after a certain time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not quite O.K.
It is hard to expect a game of this kind to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea how the car behaves before impacting any object, then obviously not everything is okay.
Typical example: When overtaking or driving past oncoming cars, you "strive" the other car only slightly in some places, but in another, almost identical situation you get into the spin and turn wild pirouettes.
Or drive the car straight to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, this does not matter anymore, it is always annoying.
The restarts are solved in this way: if you have total damage or land far off the track, then the game throws you back to the last clue of the track.
Only - in every race you have only five restarts.
Once you have exhausted them, everything starts all over again.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something does not work, but you should rather not rely on it.
Sometimes even the restart doesn't help, because nothing helps but to learn the critical section from the head.
It is extremely unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, you have to drive through in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.
Elsewhere, you always encounter "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you are first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see the opponent passing two cars in front of you, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them around or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, everything is designed in such a way that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent in the same place and again without regard to the time.
At the end of the game on the long bridge you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent obviously has to overtake one here on the devil come out.
And if he is already in front of you, then of course he takes the view, so that you initially drive your own car a few times in Klump.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that you quickly miss the joy of the game.
And that is a pity, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is overall quite entertaining and in places also so action-packed that you almost do not know where your head stands.
And in principle, no matter what "guilt" is about it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the car change in the course of the races.
You should not overlook the petrol stations on the track, because it is here that you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have is sufficient.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history also goes the task mode (challenges) - i.e. the races in the individual locations that you know from the history.
There are not only medals, but also experience points to win for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and history.
To get to the higher driver level, various items must be unlocked: from the car started, to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time connected to the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares its own achieved results with those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible carvings is a situation in the last race in history.
Here you get by car into a subway tunnel (meinetwegen), where you ride in the dark on the rails for a long time (meinetwegen).
On the speedometer, figures between 150 and 200 km/h (my way around), but there suddenly comes from behind a subway and drives one uncompromisingly to scrap.
In our editorial office, we will probably argue for a long time whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
All the more annoying is that at some exciting moments the refresh rate slows down and this sometimes quite dramatically.
However, this applies in particular to accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound reproduction is OK so far and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to young audiences on a scale as wide as possible, a soundtrack was created a l<0xC3><0xA1> "something from everyone" - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game were not diminished by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned, we could have claimed with the breast tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
This is how the game seems unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but you should be prepared for these mistakes to catch your eye with the power of airport headlights.

EU Ambassador Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has clearly upset the balance between the various institutions."
I didn't expect such a hard war to burn out."
"It will take five or six years for the waves to settle and everyone will get used to their new role," Milena Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law quite sharply.
How seriously she takes the motto "Understanding and open about Europe" was shown in the first part of her lecture, in which she succeeded in describing the individual organs of the EU and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have envied so many lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the Charles University.
Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism was made that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who was not up to such a role, but I must say it has taken everyone's breath away, how well he has taken care of the matter.
"He is a person who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, communicate with them and above all has clear ideas about how the EU should proceed.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: "Who is this - the European Union? What number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards the agreement and better legibility of EU policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil caps Quargel
Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also devoted herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived, lived and intends to live in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency of two years ago as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the fall of the government during the presidency as a major negative, which had severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was quite hectic not only at the Presidency, but also at the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome.
And the EU’s seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated precisely because of today’s economic situation.
Whether it will be a lean and frugal budget, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will receive more and which will receive less support - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Understanding Europe".
"If I don't like something, it's gray abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
As a citizen, how am I supposed to know whether Brussels is really going to come up with crooked or round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes, or whether someone actually wants to ban us from doing so?
She would also have liked to use the soil of the EU to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in prospect
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics, who perceive the negative rather than the positive side of things.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters and last but not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or a Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the Frenchman next to me says: "Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again?" and makes a pretty sour face.
According to Ms Vicenové, in the future, the EU expects above all tough rules for the budget policy of the member states.
Much more real than a "European Federation", it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation."
“For the first time, it was said that only those countries should work together who want it and those who do not want it should stand quietly apart.”
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately result in a strong 'Europe of different speeds'," Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> expects.
In this regard, she also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues affecting the entire EU must be discussed by all member states, and not just by the eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to search for a word that most accurately characterizes IBM’s strategy, it would probably be the word “longevity.”
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, known as a modern company, although a century has passed since its inception.
The basis for this longevity was already laid by its first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he had the slogan that countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" became the trademark for the future giant's life (and at the same time the title of the in-house magazine that IBM started publishing in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen’s thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continual movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a century because it remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society over the course of our first century.
We hope to do even more in the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
Well-thought-out system
As early as the 1930s, Watson provided social care for his employees – in a similar way to the entrepreneur Ba<0xC5><0xA5>a in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people were one of the first American employees to have paid holidays, insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a well-designed remuneration system for the best innovators and dealers.
IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are just as sophisticated.
The company was brilliant from the start in talent development - as one of the first companies worldwide IBM picked up any discrimination - and could choose accordingly.
Consistent with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is for Palmisan to be replaced by a woman at the helm of IBM next year – Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years and has held the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has been doing online brainstorming in recent years, which has led to many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder – there are plenty of ideas, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Her unwavering position in the business guarantees the company a strong image, both internally and externally.
“From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company,” said Economist, Harvard Business School professor and author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with the help of technology,” added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be only present in the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - called "Big Blue" in the states of its logo because of family, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It’s one of the most versatile technology companies ever – IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services across an incredible range of products – from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all the American technology companies, IBM owns the most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His best-known inventions include ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes and floppy disks.
With approximately $220 billion in market capitalization, IBM was the second-largest technology company (equal to Apple) this year, surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of today's customers - for example, the attempt with their own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or the computers IBM PC jr.
“Business is based on the forward movement, so you can’t emotionally tie yourself to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms – and if they don’t work, leave them too.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
IBM’s profits are largely shared by services, software and hardware, each accounting for one-fifth of the company’s profits.
In 1990, hardware with a share of more than fifty percent was the most strongly represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion in low-profit assets, but at the same time it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-oriented technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world like a storm for the first time.
Here, too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the midst of the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that the company IBM survives the current crisis unscathed.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent in a rocket-like manner since 2008, and the company’s net profit is growing continuously.
IBM’s corporate slogan is: everything can be changed – but not the values.
This is another reason why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also cope with the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flight
The company IBM (International Business Machines), founded in New York a hundred years ago, initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was not adopted until 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch office in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later company IBM was laid by the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 80s of the 19th century.
They owned technologies such as the famous lancing card clocks to register the start and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
This leader then eclipsed even the founders of IBM - on Watson's ideas based to this day the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began manufacturing and selling all kinds of machines for the trade - from sausage and cheese cutters, to cash registers.
In the first four decades Watson led the company, he doubled its revenue to $9 million and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the executive chair for a full forty years, only then he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM engineers and computers helped guide flights into space – to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969, the famous flight of humans to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that defined the computer standard of that time was launched in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand it bought the consulting part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thereby fully entered the business with consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the past three years is the “Smarter Planet” concept.
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned so far, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and urban management.
In the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smarter Commerce” platform, which is designed to help merchants lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM founded a branch in what was then Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern European Headquarters is located in Prague and is also home to a world-class team of researchers working on voice recognition technology.
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> on her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband, Josef Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (53) of the protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (45), became their lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the next life she has set herself clear rules.
"Joseph can come home, but no more than my partner," D. Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> explained.
When Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> had offered the singer I. Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> refuge in her own house, she would not even have imagined in her dream how things would turn out with her husband.
When, at her urging, Iveta left and returned to <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>any after 30 days, Joseph immediately went with her.
He even admitted publicly that he loved her.
In time Darina resigned, yes it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychyt<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> should leave in the future, then he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a human being with whom I still have certain ties," said Mrs. Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1>; but she also said that she had already emotionally separated from him and insisted solely on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door for him, Joseph carries so far with dignity.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I'm staying with Iveta, nothing will change."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company keeps running, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the plot, I make the purchases."
"I talk to Darina normally, but we don't share the bed," said J. Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn’t want to stop her.
“We don’t sleep together, so I don’t care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I realize that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I take on all responsibility.
The worst female vices: How about you?
If you ask the men to name some typical female vices, they will invariably shake a few out of the sleeve promptly.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we review a few unsettled people who let the blood flow to the men in the veins?
Addiction
Does their spouse accuse them of being shopaholic?
Do you need to buy at least one hater a week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a bit more during promotions?
Then your case is really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping cravings under control.
But hand on heart, what woman can stand to stroll through a clothing store in search of a well-fitting outerwear and not try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times you’ve told your husband to stay outside.
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
“Do I like you at all?”
Does that seem familiar to you somehow?
Yeah? Yeah.
Then you are probably one of the women who are really obsessed with how they look.
This does not mean that you should let yourself go, but many men are allergic to it if their wife constantly whines about her appearance.
The stronger sex is in agreement - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly incompatible.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a battle against windmills.
Cleaning windows, wiping tiles and dust, scrubbing the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Do you curse with your partner, because he tramples on the clean tiles with dirty shoes again, do you scold the children, because the just scrubbed sink is dirty again and because the glass door at the living room cabinet already has fingerprints again, while polishing makes so much effort?
If you suffer from this type of "deviantness", then you should know that one must not exaggerate anything and that order and cleanliness in family life do not come first.
This immeasurable purity can ultimately also harm mutual relationships and, above all, the peace in the family.
Stinging
"Dirty gym pants come in the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to wear those old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, don’t be surprised if that puts him in the palm of your hand.
Of course, this is not meant badly, they just want everything to have its order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to complain so much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to gossip and gossip, gossip behind their backs or even slander or forge alliances.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to haggle through such topics as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably every one of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and gossip in store.
Hand on heart - this is probably the case for all women.
But this is not to be confused with clatters of the grossest caliber, to whom nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their environment and who represent a considerable danger, especially for women’s collectives.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr and Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek helped Philadelphia to victory with their assistants
Ice hockey forward Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr was a big part of Philadelphia's 5-3 win on the Carolina ice at Monday's NHL game with two assists, making him once again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star benefited from the overview in both cases by Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was named the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded J<0xC3><0xA1>gr's fellow player Jakub Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After the game, J<0xC3><0xA1>gr claimed to journalists that he had predicted Giroux a big evening.
"Even before the game, I'm telling him he's going to hit a hat-trick today."
I kind of had that feeling.”
"There's such a feeling here and there," said J<0xC3><0xA1>gr, whose action allowed Giroux to score in the Flyers' first shot.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek won the puck behind the goal of the Hurricanes and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first third was played, the home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hander, but the second third then belonged again to the Flyers.
Specifically Giroux.
In collaboration with J<0xC3><0xA1>gr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds steered his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love to play with him.”
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league, but he’s definitely one of the best three,” J<0xC3><0xA1>gr said.
"I wouldn't have thought in my life that at the end of my career I would be playing with such an ice hockey player as he is."
"I'm very happy about that."
"I'm cutting my game towards me."
"All the years in the NHL, my teammates adjusted their game to me and now the skewer is turning around," J<0xC3><0xA1>gr smiled.
Carolina made the game a drama - by the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who prevailed from a penalty shot, it came to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful in excess of two against one.
"Excellent Pronger was still active in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I picked up speed and (Read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad that it worked out," Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last goal of the game from his point of view.
This victory put Philadelphia at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek injured himself in the game against Buffalo and retired in the second third because of an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candiens lost their lead in the penalty shootout 2:3.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec was unable to transform one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points probably hurt the coach of the home team the high disease-related failure on the defensive - they played the game with only five defenders to the end.
"That's bad."
"We ended the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"At every change, one wave after another, and we had nothing to oppose it."
"We should have made the game easier and taken the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
The Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec fought off 30 shots from Tampa Bay and contributed significantly to the 5-2 win over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets, who thus ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five approved state travel agencies in the former <0xC4><0x8C>SSR: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at that time mainly only sold trips to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, in the West at that time only the chosen were allowed.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to Lake Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore the trips to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (including the Czechoslovaks) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered trips to the west, but then you had to accept huge queues or sleep in a sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, the matter was far from over.
The so-called foreign exchange promise - the condition for an exit to the West - was only given to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a foreign exchange commitment it would have been impossible to raise the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that continues to this day.
The velvet revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries all over the world last year.
A huge paradox, of which one is not even aware today, is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the foreign exchange obligation was lifted in the neighboring Western European countries, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
When traveling to Paris, Czech holidaymakers slept in a tent in the park, because who would have had the money for an accommodation in a hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature of trips abroad by Czechs at that time was a trunk full of canned food, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the western currency freely.
Our standard of living and, as a result, our average salaries increased, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, after 1997, travel agencies began to prepare regular trips through charter flights, which made air travel incredibly cheap compared to the past thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the US, already had currency-free payments with all the advanced countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post- velvet" travel came in 2000, when thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was handled - to Thailand.
Since then, every year direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers fly to far-flung sunny countries; this year, twelve exotic destinations are flying directly from the Czech Republic.
Around 100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the most highly developed countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than CZK 15 thousand per capita on a single holiday, including the costs at the resort.
The general meeting is to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
Czech football has been without a chairman for almost five months, and Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek’s successor at the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) is not even known after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
To date, there is still no agreement on which electoral system should be chosen.
And without this, no vote at all on the three potential successors is possible.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
In June, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned from his post, calling on his colleagues at the time of his resignation to come to an agreement and find a strong personality who could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the old quarrels between the two chambers of associations broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clearly demonstrated on 16 September, when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the People’s House in the Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov district of Prague for nothing, because the negotiation did not lead to any result and this was not just about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or even the officials with a power of attorney.
On this only point, at least partial agreement was reached, which was also helped by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, whose opinion was that representation on a power of attorney basis was not permissible.
Disputes over the electoral order, however, continue.
The Executive Committee also did not bring more clarity to the matter, whose meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda at all.
Even if the views regarding the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a stalemate situation?
"The point of dispute concerns whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or whether a completely different model must be found," said Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Moravia is reportedly willing to compromise on the fact that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no sense at all, this mode would question the entire bicameral concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, who would prefer not to bend the electoral order, but to choose according to the valid statutes.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k surprisingly agrees with this, even if it appears that the statutory electoral order of all candidates is most likely to meet Pelta.
"My wish is that as much as possible be elected according to the statute."
"So that no nonsensical substitute variants are devised, as at the last Annual General Meeting," explained the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who is running for the first time and in his statements distinguished himself above all from Pelta.
Pelta is optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championship today would certainly contribute to calming the minds."
"If football is riding the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is greater," says the functionary from Jablonec, who has the greatest experience of all three adepts, both on a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambivalent."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to 'fix' the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a renewed blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
“However, I hope common sense ultimately wins,” Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time for the agreement of all sides no longer remains.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualification game.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl, among others, were to fly to Podgorice, could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical malfunction and so they were feverishly looking for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the executive committee still to the venue of the Barrage first game.
In the end, the meeting at the ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday, will be decisive.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, the Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to have the divided parties within the country’s largest sports association come to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: government subsidies, the confidentiality of Czech football and the upcoming <0xC4><0x8C>STV Annual General Meeting, which is to show the Czech sport the new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k goes into the fight for the position of chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, the head of the Pilsner football team, could have been a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not have taken the fight for this top position at all.
“If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election.”
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
The main reason for Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favourite of the election, Pelta, from getting to the top of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also emphasizes that in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the function of chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
“I spoke to some of the people in question in person.”
“It’s hard to believe that some people told me they didn’t want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k allegedly interferes with Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association, Roman Berbr, a man of controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k that Pelta should hold the position of Chairman.
In his victory, the current state would be preserved and in Czech football it would not progress at all.
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be doubly bad for football," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelta's name was dropped some time ago in connection with telephone interceptions for the investigation into a corruption affair, but from which Pelta emerged unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said <0xC5><0x99>ekl Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who saw his earlier statement that "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman", but a little more relaxed.
However, if Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k wins in the Thursday election, he could well imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, whom Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k had supported before the Annual General Meeting in October, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities".
"I could imagine him as the head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's capable of running the association as a manager."
"I'm not sticking my nose in matters that I don't understand," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who had caused a stir in September that he was behind the dismissal of the arbitration commission with Lu<0xC4><0x8F><0xC4><0x9B>k Macela at the head, replacing Dagmar Damkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k himself claims that he feels he is up to the role of association chairman.
He has also been the head of Pilsen since last summer, which, with his support, celebrated its first victory in the league in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups, which tend to influence disciplinary and appointment commissions, which degenerates into disgusting situations," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who makes no secret of his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta boss Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
As one of his priorities, he would see the strengthening of relations between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby the political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to flow into the sport.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should be devoting himself to."
“When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but then they also have to say clearly where the money is going,” he said.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also does not see his connection to the Pilsner club as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R must be "non-partisan".
Pelta, on the other hand, is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"But I don't think it makes much sense to hypocritically transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person, only to return after a year and a half," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Pelta promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R statutes that would rule out a stalemate in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the chairmanship, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would advocate that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R be given new statutes that would rule out disputes over the electoral rules in the future.
The functionary from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will defuse with a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and raising funds in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting and so the two-month break may help him to defend his ideas about the management of football and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time for the association to be led by someone, says the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who also acted for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
That is also why he believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is responsible for today’s problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, at the Annual General Meeting in June, statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September,” Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the Citizens’ Association that he used as a means of attracting the delegates.
“If I become chairman, I take it personally and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn’t work out.”
“It’s a matter of principle that he can’t be without,” Pelta said.
Furthermore, he does not try to separate himself from his opponents.
He had already announced earlier that he could imagine working with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, whom he recognizes for his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also did not attack Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k for a long time, who in turn left no dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he has been around for over a year and can already point to some successes."
However, his attacks were disparaging and many people were shocked by his election campaign.”
"That's why many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remains true to his proclamations, which he already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest leagues to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
"I would also seek to end all affairs - from the Bohemian cause to the reverberations of last year's corruption scandal."
“Right after that, I would jump into negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole of football,” said the forty-six-year-old candidate <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his move to the top of Czech football would not mean personnel purges.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where there is understandably nervousness due to the long anarchy.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
“If really the only contentious point is how to vote in the third round, then we’ll get over it.”
“Football needs credibility, and it can only win it back when it finally has a new leader,” Pelta said.
Rajchl promises that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will start to work hard under him
If former Vice-Chairman Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl were to be elected as the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, it would allegedly ruin the mood of many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that if he chooses, he will start working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and hold the members of the Executive Committee accountable for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that the previous chairman Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has begun.
"As chairman, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to the national selection, to professional football, to performance football for the youth."
"That's not to say that I want to do everything on my own," Rajchl told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I am a team player and therefore would like to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that football progresses in every segment with mile increments."
Many would not be delighted by this, because instead of just criticizing the work of others, she would now have to start working really hard herself," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, I have considered no longer running at all.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
“But I need to know that it makes sense and that there are people behind me who are not constantly throwing clubs between my legs and questioning every step I take,” he said as an explanation of why he hesitated.
“A lot of people told me that I shouldn’t give up, because otherwise others would.”
“This is trust that cannot be squandered,” he said.
He is also said to be motivated to continue the work he started under Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"In two years we've done a lot of work and I don't want to throw that away."
"Procedures have been started, which will probably only come to fruition in a few years, and I would be reluctant to see someone stop them," he said, expressing his concern that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - was elected, the situation could return to the times before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"I believe in systematic action and that is something that Mirek Pelta does not bring."
“Behind him are mainly people who would make football so that it would only be there for the chosen ones.”
You can accuse me of something, but not that I would be partial."
“I try to be objective.”
“I want football for everyone, because then everyone will be fine and not just the chosen one,” Rajchl said.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a president of the Czechs.
"Even though some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best I can for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian division, whose winners then each rose to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Now that the head of the Plze<0xC5><0x88> club Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k has joined the fight for the function of chairman, Rajchl does not dare assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-chairman and now recognizes that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the saving of tens of millions of crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he is partly to blame for the fact that the association does not pull on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to help Czech football regain confidence", he considers the second rival - Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer football.
"No one can question that he did an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has initiated and he would obviously not fundamentally change the staffing in the commissions."
He certainly wouldn’t want to turn things in his favor,” Rajchl said of his rival.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
by Julia Stanek
Paddling pool in UFO optics, sumptuous pools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience your blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike, rest your tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is best.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past year and a half, one thing could not be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying back on the water, she looked up into elaborately designed domes, swam towards marble putties waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a bath, she quickly took it into her notebook - with interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were explored by architecture historian Meder in this way - and now she presents them in her just published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore-Concrete Buildings" in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sports, she has not much on her mind, says Meder - only in the water is different.
Annoyingly, swimming fans have to put up with blue tiles and chlorine smell, while joggers can breathe in the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful bird chirping in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools have to be so ugly,” says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Lapping in the plunge pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are served, says Meder.
And if the builders have made an effort, swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in bathrooms."
"On the one hand it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything visually doubles: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format illustrated book "Badefreuden" conveys interesting information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases on 190 pages - but above all makes you want to jump into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing body of water in a quaint karst cave (cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose pools are filled with alkali-containing water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (V<0xC3><0xA1>rosi Term<0xC3><0xA1>lfürdöny in J<0xC3><0xA1>sz).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: while you have the whole city in mind from the Zurich roof bath, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can observe the hustle and bustle on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in L<0xC3><0xA4>ngenfeld: the Aquadome <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
It steams from three open-top shells in winter, while in the background the mountains of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal valley rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder got the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d bath in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells so much of fuel oil that it is hard to believe you have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline-hydrocarbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose silt sticks to your skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful swimming spots: When she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing area in the Czech town of Luhatschowitz, she found a closed-off terrain.
The bathroom, designed by architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902, has since been closed.
As Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds proliferating between the tiles.
However, the decline has been counteracted in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
This bath has already undergone three phases of construction; you can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements dating from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because it is originally from the Black Forest.
"It's an achievement to merge such different architectural styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
In such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank to investigate raw materials business
by Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank abandoning its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the CEO wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg - Hamburg
According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions leave this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges are driving up prices - and the banks are therefore complicit in the global hunger problem.
The campaign of the consumer advocates is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even if major banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Commodity bets were originally intended to hedge traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled themselves from supply and demand - and are making profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said that no business was "worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit is to be completed by the end of the year, after which the results will be presented to the Board of Management of Deutsche Bank - with a recommendation on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the head of the bank wants to announce what consequences it will draw.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw materials business, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann tinkering with his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "Betting on rising prices of food shows particularly drastically how recklessly banks are harming the common good today."
Ackermann, as the top bank lobbyist, is now particularly committed to the task.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio that use money to bet on food prices,” Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is talking about people suffering from hunger or about the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Chief Executive Officer will not be joining the Supervisory Board as planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And he hardly has to worry about any possible losses - after all, this would have to do with his successor.
One in two would cancel raw material investments
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Institute Forsa surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 11 percent consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments in which prices for food are bet on.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learn that their bank participates in such transactions: According to the survey, one in two would terminate all investments where money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said to think about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with highs, lows and a happy ending: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion in Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and vanished.
It is now being re-opened as an exhibition hall.
When modern post-war architecture is swarming with clear shapes, glass halls, bold twists and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Schwanzer is a striking and famous example for the 1958 Brüssler World Exhibition.
Schwanzer's pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still regarded as a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the pavilion at the next world exhibition in Austria.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like outbuilding in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been erected in the Swiss Garden near Vienna’s Südbahnhof, rebuilt and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century – the “20er Haus” (Twenty House).
However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has stood empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the <0xC3><0x96>sterreichische Galerie Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a postdoctoral art historian with a considerable career, including in her youth as a figure skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, emphatically enforced the conversion among politicians and monument conservationists, she procured public funds and private sponsorship funds and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there was to be a café and a bookshop, and an office building had to be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krischanitz was the ideal cast for the performance.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich’s Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an “extremely important place” for him, where he had looked at the exhibitions “almost every weekend”.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and its conversion.
With the current conversion, there were far greater problems: The building was "an energy slur", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade were replaced, glass-fiber-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel girders have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements brought room for the new use, a lowered light pit between the house and the street provides the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red-brown anti-rust shade.
And the cinema room is still exactly as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and points to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and light.
It had been difficult with the pavilion, “which came from Brussels”, Krischanitz has recently said, a typical “drop-in-the-city story”.
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because an urban luck has occurred: Around the Swiss garden, the completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential buildings, is currently being built.
And another stroke of luck may come: The 21er Haus could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss garden.
Rail plans multi-million winter crisis package
The railway has devised a crisis plan to prevent train failures in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending an additional 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing an internal crisis plan of the Group, that investments of a total of around 300 million euros are planned by 2015.
The aim is to improve the availability of vehicles and the rail network even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees for snow removal on railway facilities and platforms to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free platforms of snow and ice within four to five hours and 90 percent of the operationally necessary switches.
Two months ago, rail boss Rüdiger Grube had warned of train cancellations and delays this winter after a top meeting with the government and industry.
Last winter, the railway had considerable problems in passenger traffic, because it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
Numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Authority for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been struggling for years with the fact that it has to have axles of ICE trains tested much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE in Cologne's main station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank Pays Millions of Dollars in the United States
After the tumult around boss Josef Ackermann comes new misfortune from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now also catching up with its past in the US: The Frankfurt Institute is paying 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
Financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of large banks of misleading cooperative banks into buying the financial products and downplaying the risks.
During the financial crisis, such securities lost their value and dragged the banks into the depths.
“We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court,” said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank was not to blame for the comparison.
The same goes for Citigroup, which committed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the two financial institutions' agreement.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is in charge of the U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in bankruptcy proceedings to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the billion-dollar damage that has been caused.
The comparisons now made are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also sidelined other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, this became the fate of a variety of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers tipped over.
Even though the events have been going on for a few years, the banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits seeking reparation or punishment for wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has sparked the biggest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks of having outperformed the two state-owned U.S. real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions in the volume of around 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit from the FHFA, which concerns several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires Frankfurters to stand trial for "substantial losses" without specifying an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the demands as baseless and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett Joins IBM With $10 Billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought more than $10 billion worth of shares.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always stated not to invest in IT and computer companies, because the long-term development of the companies can only be predicted poorly.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s annual reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, IBM is now allowed to call itself "Sir IBM".
Buffett revealed on CNBC that he has purchased $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known about the commitment so far.
He praised the management, which had ensured decent profits even in the economic crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for quite some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had previously avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies that he understands.
Instead, Buffett accessed a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer, or machine builders, for example.
In addition to around 80 of its own subsidiaries, its holding company Berkshire Hathaway also owns shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with smart investments, turned it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost unerring sense of earning money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
After the Buffett investment became known, IBM shares rose by one percent on the pre-market.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he does not want to get in.
Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now revived.
The murders of eight Turkish-born and one Greek small business owner in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turks, this is a ghost that has long been believed to be dead: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
That there is xenophobia in Germany, however, was never in question.
However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology revived?" headlined the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators is said to have been a V-man of the constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany reacted with caution: It reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
Togetherness was staged in cheerful colours - as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media acts like a slap in the face: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth" is the title of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which talks about the background of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" does not allow itself to draw this mental connection.
“It’s starting to stink,” is the title of Ahmet Külahci’s column.
He emphasizes that people have been murdered, who have paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
The actions of the police and their subsequent search success are discussed critically in German Turkish internet forums.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not think of looking for suspects in right-wing extremist circles much sooner.
Some people, at least rhetorically, are prepared to resort to drastic means: “If we continue to slouch here, the migrants have no choice but to defend themselves and arm themselves.”
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
"On the goodness of the enlightenment and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very strongly the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means when inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties made clear.
The photo of the fire ruin of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the feeling of togetherness on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
At that time, the Turkish press criticized the failure of German politics after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president, but was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then listed in his speech how many levies were paid by the local Turks.
Just as if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the rule of law has been since then.
In addition to the efforts to comprehensively educate and re-evaluate right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time there is a need for open words.
The scandal bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has been sliding from one crisis to the next ever since.
Now it's up to a German to judge.
Axel Weber certainly didn’t think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take on an almost as spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss major bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity, and made friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
"UBS has made the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But back in September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A UBS trader in London had bypassed all of the bank’s hedging systems and gambled around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
The Chairman of UBS’s Board of Directors has since also been struck down – and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
It has already been announced that Weber will be allowed to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the Board of Directors in May - not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This is going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather an economics professor and central banker and would certainly have needed a training period.
At one stroke, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proven once again that it deserves the title of "Europe's biggest scandal bank".
On the one hand, UBS is huge – until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world – and on the other hand, it has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once-proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She had combined the image of the secretive and solid Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very big number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money from high-net-worth clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later long-time banking professor in Zurich, says: "I always presented UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, you ask yourself: How could I have been so wrong?"
He was greatly mistaken.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something had gone horribly wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli surprisingly resigned, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and just as ingenious banker.
A few months later, he realized why he had left.
The bank’s investment division had been bogged down with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To cope with this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs.
For this, she actually found investors, but one that some would have raved about until recently: an opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund that was so secret that you didn’t even know its name.
But that was only the first blow.
It got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new losses of billions, and in 2006 Chairman Marcel Ospel, Switzerland’s second best-paid board member, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS faced the collapse of its misinvestment in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The SNB bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a compulsory convertible bond that allowed it to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - for she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such large banks.
After all, UBS’s balance sheet total in 2007 was more than five times as large as Switzerland’s economic output (see chart).
“Once again, we could not save UBS,” says banking researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who may have evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
She also agreed to a payment of $780 million as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including a penalty.
Thus, UBS more or less openly admitted to having helped in tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of client funds.
Within a few months, the bank had lost credibility in both core business areas: in investment banking through misspeculation and in asset management through tax evasion assistance.
And just as things calmed down a little, just when it was thought that UBS would be able to do it again, this unfortunate dealer story follows: A single dealer gambles 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it becomes apparent that risk management in investment banking is still not working.
"With the Adoboli case, we have found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have control over risk."
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago started to become guardians of the world’s great assets: no too great risks, but security for money – even beyond the Alpine republic the world might collapse.
The safes of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the dignified Swiss private bank - it is only a bit larger.
Even the location is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Züricher Bahnhofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, which leads directly from the main train station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers such as Tiffany's can be found here between traditional Swiss shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have resided here for centuries: from the National Bank and the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Baer.
The UBS reception room is accessed through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are marble-clad, in front of them are thick leather armchairs, next to the bench logo a large sign for the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has replaced both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or betray, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two major banks.
UBS has become much too big, he believes – especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And if they do, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the coalition government of the small seven million country decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas H<0xC3><0xA4>ssig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion Swiss francs, or around 45 billion euros, were approved by the politicians to save the large bank, which is facing bankruptcy.
How could it have happened?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem above all in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into one giant corporation.
The result was a bank that was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and continued to grow.
This helped to complement the two different predecessor banks of UBS: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalised bank.
All of a sudden, the internationalized investment bankers came up with a lot of money that they could use to spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, modest, who understands a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man, who has worked his way up from the banking doctrine to the very top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear that there was a lot of overconfidence before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings where CEO Wuffli repeated the same slogan over and over again: toppling Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where UBS wanted to go, to the top.
A few steps had already been taken.
In the foreign exchange business and in stock trading, she played at the top.
However, business consultants who were hired highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banker's language "fixed income", there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost them their existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a pre-established hedge fund invested in American subprime assets.
It developed into a huge machine that packaged and passed on securities on American mortgage loans – but also kept itself at risk.
Even when other banks have long sought an exit.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," says banking expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to leave when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than expected.
Posts at UBS have become a whirlwind seat and are shaky to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all the obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: end of investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking is expected to shrink sharply, that much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank boss Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: he is to manage the business of UBS permanently, said the Zurich Bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti plans to bring the investment bank back to its mid-1990s level.
3500 jobs will be eliminated.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
How does she want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking himself.
So far, he has only said publicly that he and his wife will first look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock market
The impending recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors at the start of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remained without force.
The slowed industrial production on the continent suffocated the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief over the changes of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still considered half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems were again pressing into the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, financial values were on the sales lists.
At the close of trading, the Dow Jones index of default values was down 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, down 1%.
The index of the technology exchange Nasdaq lost 0.8 percent and went out of business with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a decrease of 1.2 percent at 5985 meters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is preparing for the end of the upswing.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
“We’re not an island, we’re dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get out of a recession so quickly, and there are further signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett overthrew a decades-old principle and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional group and made it initially just under one percent higher against the trend in the course of trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of $170 per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
At 2.6 percent, Bank of America shares declined significantly more than the market.
The house silvered almost all of its shares in the China Construction Bank, for $6.6 billion.
With the net profit from the business, the institute wants to boost its capital ratio and thus meet tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased, thus limiting losses in the Dow.
The stock gained 1.5 percent after the group collected the largest order in its history.
Emirates ordered 50 777 long-haul aircraft on Sunday, bringing the value of the order to $18 billion.
Including options on 20 more machines, the volume even amounts to 26 billion dollars.
On the New York Stock Exchange, about 710 million shares changed hands.
719 values increased, 2281 declined and 79 remained unchanged.
At the Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares increased by 630, in 1913 by minus, and 82 remained unchanged.
Smart Crows Spread in Cities
In many places, seed crows are considered "problem birds": But the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, experts say.
Some like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities, residents complain about the dirt and noise of animals.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crows can no longer be gotten out of the cities, experts said at the first Crow Symposium in the East Frisian Leer.
There, experts from all over Germany discussed possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists attributed the problems in cities to the rural exodus of the specially protected seed crows: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing cultivation and the felling of typical incubators made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs can be found in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the county had caused negative headlines.
Critics had described catching the animals in bird traps and killing them with clubs as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the grumbling, does nothing," said Werner Klöver, a city and landscape planner from Leer.
Spraying nests with water or felling trees often has undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals dodge, large colonies split up and spread out in other places."
Only as an exception at hospitals, old people’s homes or schools is imaginable.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
A combination of greasing of the animals from sensitive living areas and baiting offers is conceivable, in order to resettle them in other places.
"Info boards instead of chainsaws", on the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens called for a completely different way of dealing with the animals: "After all, we can best bear a pimple on the face with confidence."
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Kr<0xC3><0xA4>hen-Lehrpfad in Schleswig-Holstein, where signposts inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project has already been adopted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and dexterity of the animals are legendary: Seed crows not only use tools to get a treat, but even make their tools themselves as tools.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the intelligence of the birds on four seed crows.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to collapse a skeleton with stones in order to get to a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly realized what size and shape a stone must have to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the smart crows then had to solve a trickier problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid them pieces of wire.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket at the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even managed to do this right away.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup were dashed.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland are at the Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have lost the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by the double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth European Championship participation in a row after the 0-0 from the first leg.
The Czechs reached a 1-0 (0:0) in the play-off return match with outsider Montenegro, after the first leg (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia beat Turkey in the 0-0 draw, while Ireland took a loose 1:1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored further goals for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trading meter (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had twice shortened for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the play-offs to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa to Portugal.
Portugal made a bespoke start at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo took a free-kick from around 30 meters to the early lead in the meshes.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his long shot qualities and scored from 25 meters to 2-0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance through goal-hunter Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English leader of the table Manchester City put a header at the bottom of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Afterwards, the focus was on referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Swallow and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break, the vice European champion from 2004 made everything clear with four goals.
For the Czech Republic Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time in a row that the European Champion from 1976 will be competing at the European Championships.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga-Legion<0xC3><0xA4>ren Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to survive in the initial phase a second of terror.
Finalist Petr Cech prevented a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9th) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the turn from the penalty area limit just past the goal from Cech.
After the break, the crossbar had to save for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not get past a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink must almost certainly clear his place on the bench of the World Cup third of 2002, the Croats can look forward to their fourth participation in a European Championship final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
Selcuk Inan only hit the post in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim could not sink the rebound in the goal.
After the second of terror, however, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made place for Dortmund's Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga-legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bavaria Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in action.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first European Championship participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4-0 success in the first leg, in the 32nd minute in the lead.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) compensated for the guests.
Ireland pressed the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian back team prevent the possible lead hit.
But in the 32nd minute, it was time.
After an unlucky defence from the striker Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to 1-0.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software manufacturer SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
About two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) are expected to flow by 2015, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly,” said Bill McDermott, co-chief executive officer, at a customer show in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the global leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Around 4,000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAP customers are located in the boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had raised around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is running almost rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott explained.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education."
Mass Slaughter on a Personal Level
A sensitive and generous start to Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Terror: A Story of the First World War, narrated in Nineteen Fate" with a long list of main characters that goes to heart.
Here’s a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund’s novel-like narrative, and these main characters will function as your GPS, as a beacon in those few moments when you, like Englund’s, are lost men and women in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book, which he does not incorrectly describe as "a work of anti-history".
It contains few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, frenzied reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but more "a book about how it was". It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Terror" is almost the war experience of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flares up like the votive candles in a church, some are added, while others are extinguished.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating positional war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Terror" wanders with expert views over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on beehives, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina that smells like Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance. Are you staying or are you taking the flight?
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Missing facts," Englund notes, "have been furnished with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and Terror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship's sailor.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be frightening or poignant, but they are extremely vivid in Englund’s loss of detail collection of little moments.
Many of them deal with lack and help themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, false eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the substitute meal in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and most recently served with a false bone from wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes soiled with wood."
There were, as he notes, “837 registered dietary substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes.”
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American recognizes his own urge for savagery and says of the war: “You feel that, despite everything, this is what was intended for men rather than to sit in the armchair, with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, and to pretend that such a fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade means civilization and that there is no barbarism behind one’s own strengthened and battered shirt chest.”
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die and no one will take notice or care.
“If you distance yourself from the idea of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience,” he writes.
Instead, it’s as terrible as “a condemned man who was hanged in secret.”
Other observations are about the old Europe falling apart and about new kinds of terror.
“The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” Englund writes, “a war between the factories.”
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word skillful and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a made-to-measure suit who slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways, and there are frivolous behaviors as well as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect a prostitute with a venereal disease in order to escape the front line service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade in gonococci, because soldiers bought and smeared themselves on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital," he writes.
“Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, which made them blind for the rest of their lives.”
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes supple yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "uncontrollable forces unleashed in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War were usually more falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "Im Westen nichts Neues" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read in a non-fiction book.
I don't give it away anymore.
But it is as if he had snatched away this page with the main characters in front of us with his book and lit it with a match.
After an early misstep, a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
They had decided on the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there were hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed; all the others initially believed they would participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and gave the squatters an enormous increase in public sympathies, were not allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were being handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials stepped up so-called chaos training – counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid relocation of a large number of police officers – to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came “at the last minute,” said someone familiar with the orders, which spoke of a declaration as “exercise.”
“The few policemen involved, to my knowledge, did not know that it was about Zuccotti Park,” said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only people who knew it was Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the resort."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then retreated when hundreds of protesters gathered after learning of these plans.
Officers from various police units were involved in Tuesday’s operation, including task forces from around the city—hundreds of mobile officers usually deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that during the day, many people go in and out of the park, almost like commuters, so 1 a.m. is a good time to go in.
“It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people are in the park,” he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lights and loudspeakers were ready for departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and the pre-recorded messages that roared from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When public officials entered the park in their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left the place.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 a.m. to give protesters time to pack up their belongings.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests become necessary in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said this was done for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they were prevented from observing the police actions in the park, and they said that the handling of the officers was very rough.
Mr. Browne said that television cars could have taken pictures on Church Street on the west side of the park.
As the police moved westward through the protesters’ vast mess of personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags of clothes, their city cleaning staff followed, picking up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside, and pictures of them appeared on the internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters took up position near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp tied themselves together by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Civil protection officials were called in to cut them loose.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were made at the park until about 3:30 a.m.
According to police, the eviction was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests, he said, were due to “inappropriate behavior and resistance to arrest.”
The most prominent officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the criminal department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly “did not lead the operation,” as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were built on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south.
It was possible to observe how from these locations the police extended the perimeter further and further around Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officers, many of them with shields, were seen driving people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle south of Pine Street, and other demonstrators left the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Union of supervisors will file lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school carers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday as the layoffs are unnecessary and discriminatory due to their undue influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last option left open to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to undo the layoffs.
Six hundred seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other employees, who were among the city’s lowest-paid employees and lost their jobs in a move on October 7, described by union leaders as political revenge for having denied the city access to a health fund maintained by the working groups last year to close the budget gap.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a city council hearing last month, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said the layoffs were part of the budget passed in June.
A member of the city council fired back and told him that nothing in the budget specified that school help staff would be dismissed.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Department of Education of a lawsuit. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference formally announcing the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the city’s Department of Education as defendants and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are women of color or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Justice, said the lawsuit was not available to the city and therefore its individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a lawsuit filed by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the city’s slums to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfunded.
It states that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school aides in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 aides in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were fired.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states, "This is not a neighborhood of well-heeled parents who can organize donations to cushion budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th district’s budget was cut by 3.26% this year, and funds were lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" in the U.S. usually describes a teacher's switch from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six care coordinators have been dismissed, not transferred,” the lawsuit said.
Mission Ended, Congress Ready to Agree on Libya
In the end, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already in agreement on the Libyan uprisings.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate International Relations Committee passed a resolution under the direction of Chairman John Kerry (Massachusetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "courage".
“This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House argued over the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the U.S. military’s role in NATO’s Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution authorizing the restricted use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe group of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, the bill was passed in the Senate, and the chamber overruled a decision to cut funding for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission fell into a kind of legislative purgatory – with a Congress that was upset enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the floor under his feet.
Then the indecisiveness of Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Perhaps the Senate is ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms “the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy.”
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Panel, or will they divide legislators, as the June law did?
The final version meets the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the committee.
Lugar’s spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it’s up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every congressional legislature of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures, led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area that is currently coming to a vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, even though they have tried often enough.
Goodlatte’s amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress that cover a whole range of issues.
Some are double – the same law was presented to both Congress and the Senate – others differ only slightly from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balancing budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would “control federal spending.”
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their principals — especially beginners among Republicans who want to polish up their resume — the opportunity to brag about having “written” such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit to two terms of the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that include guaranteeing the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits same-sex marriage, as well as a change that prohibits the burning of flags, is a recurring template.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As eager as the members propose changes, they move as much faster as in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators submitted 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace is fading compared to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were also not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Stripped, but not defeated," said Giffords in the first television interview after the assassination
Ten months after an armed man shot at her at close range during an election event in Tucson, Arizona, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords appeared on national television Monday night singing alone to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and saying the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress.
When she appeared with Diane Sawyer on ABC's "20/20" news, she struggled for words and needed help walking.
The broadcast showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage done by the bullet that split her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January assassination, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang — and described her recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked how she was feeling, Gifford (41) replied, “Very well.”
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special recorded just before the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special has been tracking Gifford's recovery since the January 8 assassination attempt.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you can see her in the hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod to the head.
A twitching of the lips.
And then, her first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "toast." She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: you can see the congressman singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day on therapy, said she can’t remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said he read Giffords an article in a daily newspaper about the assassination on March 12 when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people killed in the assassination.
Suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly treated with medical treatment while he waits for his trial.
"A lot of people have died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Heart, heart, heart."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly told Sawyer, she said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, 'Gabby, you weren't defeated,'" Kelly said.
You just got hit.
And you'll get through this and you'll recover and you'll come back stronger than ever before.
Troops are more likely to feel compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On one cue, a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
“The soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraiser in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, who was observed, among other things, by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I’m sure the organizers meant well.
I know, I know.
But it wasn't respect, really, it wasn't pity.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the mostly distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are showered with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting as if the people in uniform are suffering.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way of support is to press us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that returned troops faced in the final years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations take place about compassion in silence and in private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, former Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of awe as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if an “angry, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface,” said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and, upon his return, took up an upscale state post in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewers subtly questioned whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from combat.
“When you talk about your ministry, you have to hold the negative impressions against it,” Cancian told his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the Americans’ lack of interest in war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely singled out as praise by a country that has little military experience and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We as a nation no longer value military heroism as was absolutely common in World War II,” said Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public largely focuses on the suffering of a servant.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men are charged with non-intervention in a rape trial in the military court.
Should this not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was October 2008 and she was just returning to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who was carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texan woman brushed aside her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they walked into Lyman’s room, the man stepped behind them, pushed them down and raped them, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees anxiously await a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether to allow a lawsuit they filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, to go to court.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld did not take action against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the soldiers’ constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially comprised 17 plaintiffs, but rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually assaulted by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, convict, or provide appropriate justice after the alleged assault.
Burke says she is pursuing the top military leadership as the problem begins there.
“The military is hierarchical,” she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to exterminate the culture's retribution? The leadership."
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, so to speak, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The Defense Department’s defense team, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
The files of the court, which are available to Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
Due to a 1950 Supreme Court Act, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiffs' military service," the document says.
The Department of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the distinction lies solely in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 female soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s time to modernize the military, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more complaints besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans’ Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
Independently, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America collects a lawsuit against the military focusing on the diagnosis of “personality disorder” that rape victims received in order to dismiss them from service — a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women’s Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration in December, accusing her of discriminatory practices in her handling of benefits claims for individuals who claimed to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented to Congress independently by a mix of senators and representatives of both parties, which provide a number of clues.
In 2010, according to the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3,158 sexual abuse cases were reported.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure accounts for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year.
The report, published in March, also examines law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases recorded in the military came to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, she reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole host of police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She had a rape kit and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, during which she was asked about the sex she had before assaulting her boyfriend.
Six people testified as character witnesses in the name of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
“I still remember the day the verdict was read out,” Lyman says.
"I thought the contractions would start. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric ward and I remember when I came out again, I said to my commander, 'This wasn't his procedure, this was my procedure.'
Lyman was asked to see a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably discharged, so she receives no support whatsoever.
Whether the lawsuit filed by Lyman and the other plaintiffs is progressing is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Still, he notes, "In my view, they should be moving forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I am a lifelong critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is a decade behind, because they don’t have the same incentive and the same deterrent that comes with liability.
He adds, “The odds are against them... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t follow her path, Burke, the plaintiffs’ attorney, will start with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms are made,” she says.
Or until we die, whatever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who has confessed to committing murder in a July shooting in Norway that killed 77 people, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time in front of his computer until his attack and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networks.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It's easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We found that it wasn’t hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British ideas factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding place of personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply need to use the site’s advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy — just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing extremist groups across Europe and then targeted them with add-ons, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the add-ons invited users to a survey asking about their level of education, their attitude toward violence, and their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries – without even having to leave their offices once.
“It’s a fairly new research method,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoters of right-wing extremist groups are mostly young, male and resentful of immigration.
But in a sort of surprising twist, “those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, democratic, and less violent than those who remain seated behind their computer screens.”
DEMO’s work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to society trends like in “likes,” text messages, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a research boom that has seen the number of scientific papers with the name of this page in the title increase by nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that through this page you can study people you don’t normally reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to interview people from the British National Party, it was very hard to identify them."
“They had to inform the party first and it would never have allowed them access,” Bartlett says.
“With Facebook, all that falls away — you go straight to them.”
Others say that the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their binge drinking on Facebook were significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who were silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that peer-level students, such as residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student if they post too many status updates.
“You can’t solve a problem if you haven’t recognized it,” Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle, told the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would not have been found."
Facebook also constantly taps into the data of its own population.
The site’s data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, voter turnout at the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (primarily using information that only Facebook has access to – champions of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data finder accessible to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want to or not, and to be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to release its own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, anything is allowed online.
“I don’t think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he examined students’ public pages on Facebook.
"As far as she's concerned, it was just about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant will be absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much of the information in a user profile and in posts is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research has to take care of the social – and a lot of social life is still going offline.”
‘Cold and inhumane’: Anders Behring Breivik to appear before a public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two shootings in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, has described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knights Templar of Norway,” he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, permission to contact the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in pre-trial detention for 12 more weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks, he said that the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of being able to look Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he would remain behind bars.
Everyone participated with the aim that everything comes down to a lockdown.
"I thought he looked cold and inhumane," a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it goes a little further after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Wearing a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik was calm and professional throughout the hearing, looking journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and exited the building.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre hint that he was part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may please some that the attacks of July 22 seemed to be the work of a single extremist, not a group of radicals.
But does that automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
“I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn’t,” said one victim’s family member.
“It would be so much easier if he did.”
7 Lessons From The Interview With The Late Steve Jobs Shown In A Theater This Week
After Steve Jobs’s death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the tech genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted off this week before special film screenings in key markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who diligently tinkered with charts—a man who believed that many business owners suffer from “a disease of thinking that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there’s a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Idiots" about the breakup of the personal computer. And he sat with Jobs for more than an hour, in which they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
By this point, 10 years had passed since Jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computing company, NeXT, looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley’s interview was used in expert idiots, he says the interview’s copy templates were missing from delivery.
It wasn’t until after Jobs’ death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director’s garage.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
To someone known for loathing in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs’s perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatient with Cringely’s questions and spurs him to respond more quickly to themes or sub-plots of greater importance.
Recorded before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the Lost Interview somehow seems eerily far-sighted when Jobs evaluates what other companies think is right or wrong and represents his own vision of the future of the computer.
It’s one thing to read Jobs’ posthumous tributes to his career, but to see Jobs here as the eager dreamer on the verge of greatness is something very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he set out and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"During all the years in business, I always ask, "Why are you doing things?". And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's just how it's done."
Nobody knows why he does what he does. No one in the business really thinks about things in depth.
That's what I found out.
Jobs is continuing his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Astonished at how costs were recorded—mostly starting with “standard costs” that were guessed at and then adjusted with “deviation”—he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined down to the smallest detail.
How the Pope was praised:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to sneak into the telephone company and make long distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Job’s enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a toll phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while looping through as many satellites as possible.
“We sent stuff around the world a half-dozen times and when you yelled into the phone, it came out a minute later in the phone next door,” Jobs says, giggling.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We both, we didn't know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs goes on to tell of a glorious prank that Wozniak and he nearly pulled off when they called the Vatican via Blue Box in the middle of the night and wanted to talk to the Pope as much as they could to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to lash out before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unpreparedly called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"That had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braun's tube, and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built in some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had with developing a computer mouse:
"I remember resounding arguments... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for $15. That was incredibly believable.
About large companies that decline:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their stocks.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so make a better copier or printer, so what?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [are] those people who ultimately lead the businesses and the product that pushes people out of decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is eradicated by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship is necessary.
This happened with Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger if Microsoft had been in the 1990s.
You have won the defeat of victory.
About Innovation as an Art Form:
“There’s a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about your finesse.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it boils down to taste, it boils down to trying to deal with the best stuff people have created, and then trying to bring those things together into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn’t for the computer industry, they’d be doing fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws as court accepts case
On the day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama’s health laws, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will represent the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the sweeping health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that became a buzzword among conservative activists across the U.S.
In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, the outcome of which is likely to fuel the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law is toppling is likely to be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clement’s firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that supported the Federalist Society’s annual dinner, a long-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, that are challenging the law.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is heavily financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had deliberated on the case at a Washington hotel.
Among others, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republican faction in the Senate and a declared opponent of health care reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
This does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in benefit events of the law nearer and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms associated with the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, was enough to alert morale and government activists.
“This startling break with morality and the contrary to the Code is a lie to some judges’ lawsuits, the court is following the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined during a benefit event with lawyers with pending proceedings in court."
Their appearance and support of a fundraiser for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they mix court matters too easily with groups guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was an attorney general under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits came to trial in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from the case hearing because she was too involved in defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan does not make any arrangements to do so.
Boeing lands record order of $18 trillion
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 twin-engine aircraft with an option for 20 more.
Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a $1 trillion business.
It’s really a rare news that a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft in total is a record $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is Boeing’s client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order of all time for commercial aircraft over the weekend, measured by the value of the order: 50 twin-engine Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also has, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show, an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, bringing the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
“This is absolutely positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, Morningstar’s stockbroker.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but a rise in oil prices, which usually hurts airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not as damaging as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders less than other airlines when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
Emirates’ order reinforces Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body market, helping to keep Airbus’ competitor SAS at bay, which is attacking its dominance with the A350.
Boeing’s victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the launch of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The launch was postponed to gain more confidence after customers demanded a higher payload and range.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president’s sister seems to lose election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers supported opponents Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the governorship.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister apparently lost her bid to become governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, has won the race for the governorship in the Western state.
“The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan but for the whole country,” said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after Sunday’s election.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls ... they occupied election booths, built road blockades ... and hired people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly beaten Claderon, who had led in the polls before Election Day.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current incumbent governor, came in third, a severe defeat for the divided and hapless left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies ties to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence continues.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have resigned from the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how repulsive the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who will likely represent the PRI in the race for president is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, “I think this victory will make us look brave into next year.”
ADB urges Asia to help save eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the bailout of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia’s economy.
Rajat Nag, ADB’s administrative director based in Manila, said the two fastest-growing economies in the world must do “everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that are “passionately” looking at the difficulties in Europe, and said that Asia’s financial support of European leadership and European resources helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We’re all in the same boat.”
“So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
So if China and India can help, then by all means.”
Europe’s monetary union has entered a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest costs have risen dangerously, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe fueled fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls for the leading emerging markets to join forces to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channeled through the IMF, but said that reciprocal agreements – such as the purchase of bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) – would provide greater bargaining power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do everything in its power” to help the eurozone, as its economy is now suffering from declining exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an assignment, because where else do we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no reason to help the rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid for Europe to the 1.2 trillion people in India, more than 800 million of whom live on $2 a day or even less.
"At some point they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep in Greece the numerous and well-paid civil servants in public service, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crises will have “significant domino effects” on all of Asia.
ADB’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011 now threatens “the risk of gradation” due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would need to create “crisis plans” to protect themselves from a downward trend and significant capital outflow of their constituents.
Pentagon Urgent Warnings of Possible Defense Cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta fueled Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would undetectably weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon’s halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already thinking through cuts of $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress can’t make a cut in spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the Department,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called confiscation, would lead to 23% general cuts as well as a halt to numerous new projects.
“Such a high cut, carried out in such a thoughtless manner, would make most of our ship and construction projects unfeasible — you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or a building — and seriously harm other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also be forced to involuntarily separate from a large part of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would almost certainly have to leave civilians on leave in order to reach the target.”
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness."
The cuts were ultimately going to hit the combat troops,” Panetta said.
“While wartime contingents in the anti-terrorist fight are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious interference with the basic budget would adversely affect war efforts,” Panetta warned.
"Personal attitudes were cut, which would lead to delays in attitudes and the attitudes oversight that support the war."
“Staff’s salaries would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime traders, and legal as well as political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for more details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of a seizure by the Department of Defense would usher in a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is an outcome we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that should be imposed on us."
“The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its entry should not be permitted.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or reinforce demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly bluntly expressed the potential cuts, though he has had many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows he faces tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what might be ahead – a military with shell but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an Air Force squadron without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission,” Panetta said in his opening address to the Pentagon.
"It's a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to take on potential adversaries."
"She's really making you angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details of how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations on our global capability to deploy and intervene, leading to unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to the deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning stage.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship, and the new ground combat vehicle Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
Stopping the further development and testing of the F35 would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but proponents say it is an important next step in the rearmament so that potential dangers from China and other adversaries can be eliminated.
How to Uncover a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how questionable and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy coping with allegations of sexual harassment on the part of several women, and both sides accuse each other of lying.
Penn State’s leadership has been accused of perjury for allegedly withholding reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were very quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of campaign finance violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories of cheating at school and at college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers have given their students the exam answers so that they themselves are well-versed in their performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
Many of these lies are considered to be false.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or “uncovering lies” is one that is important for every person to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game, such as charades, where the goal is to shout “Have you!”, exposing a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have conducted far-reaching research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been exposed.
Lies look you in the eye.
They don’t always stutter, stammer, blush, and fidget.
However, one cannot infer from this that these liars are difficult to uncover and expose.
An experienced liar can penetrate to the truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the vast and ever-growing field of exposure, and it is clear that exposing a deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us to find our way around our complex world, especially when hiring or interviewing people or negotiating or managing is part of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people, pique their interest, and master their own emotions, and they intuitively sense how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men are more likely to tell "self-centered" lies than women whose lies are more "orientated" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that when a person has been exposed as a malefactor, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called baselining, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Observe the posture, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
You should know better when someone usually trips with their foot all the time, so they don’t wrongly blame him for tripping with their foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Think of these agglomerations as alarm bells ringing, not as evidence of exposure.
People who cheat may freeze when they try to remember their story, maybe their feet point toward the door, or they lean toward the exit, change their position in significant ways, or show a “relaxation after the interview,” this deep, relaxing exhalation, and the shift in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Questioners often erroneously signal that a job interview is over, just to keep an eye out for that relaxation after the interview.
Also, pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson’s slip-up is famous for using the past tense when he claimed his wife was still alive and sparked a national search for her.
Deceptive people can also use a distancing language: "I didn't have a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question altogether.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: "Well...to tell you the truth...as far as I know...to the best of my knowledge."
This makes the answer more perceptive than factual, which often causes the alarm bells to ring.
There is no magic tool for unmasking lies, but you can learn skills that allow you to unmask.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can become a victim of fraud less often, both in private and in professional life.
Controversial Plan of Oil Pipeline Revamped After Risk of Delayed U.S. Approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, angering the unions and at the same time calming environmentalists, the pipeline-building company is trying to reschedule the project so that it can return to normalcy.
TransCanada said Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Parliament building.
TransCanada’s Alex Pourbax said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course of action.
This came after an announcement by the State Department last week that a decision on a federal permit for the project would be postponed until the new possible course is reviewed, which avoids the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
“This is a real step forward,” Republican Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may delay a decision until 2013, after next year’s elections, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was a State Department job and pledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was to connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them because they estimate the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers, who are against the plan, are weighing the laws to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current study on environmental impact has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the energy industry source says the ministry’s chief auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process focused on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is related to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged with allegedly forcing a toddler to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle has had a rampage attack in the lobby of her Manhattan building that has made her little daughter so afraid that she has vomited in fear.
The “Lady Marmalade” singer’s tirade made 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she was suffering from “personality changes, sleep disturbance” and “increased fear of strangers,” her family said in a Manhattan Supreme Court ruling.
It was on November 10 last year that stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve set off on a family outing.
While Kevin Monk was getting the car, Roseanna Monk went with her luggage and Genevieve in her arm into the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped off her daughter for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said, 'Yes,' and went to pick her up again," she said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
"She said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't drop your daughter off near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and started scolding - she used the F-word and the A-word and got very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to pour water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,' said the child's mother.
LaBelle rushed to the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve in her arms, and had to be restrained by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so much that it had to vomit, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family requested an apology in writing, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for comment.
The lawsuit is for unspecified damages, but the family’s attorney, Sam Davis, said he doesn’t charge a fee and the family plans to donate the money they get to help with childhood cancer.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
"This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is shown to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climatic adversities slowed the economy
In the first year that Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez is in charge of the government, unemployment and undeclared work rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year that Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and has high hopes for economic growth, is at the government. However, due to the climatic adversities, there can not be talk of growth, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators worsened.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of dollars in agricultural losses, but also placed tight limits on the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity in the first quarter of the year by 3.6 percent. This is mainly due to the historic reduction in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which slowed down further economic sectors.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frost, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has led to a steady rise in unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estad<0xC3><0xAD>stica y Geograf<0xC3><0xAD>a observed a rapid rise in unemployment in the first quarter, as from January to March 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa had no employment, which is equivalent to 4.53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate increased to 5.28 percent, from July to September to 189.
Lower liquidity
The economic scientist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Aut<0xC3><0xB3>noma (UAS), comments that the policies of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
“What we’re seeing right now is a rise in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including liquidity losses in the market as a result of the cuts in funding by legislation passed to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who are illegally accumulating dollars, it’s not easy to let them work for you, invest them, or use them for anything else,” he explained.
The migration has stopped
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased. This is due to the problems of entry on the one hand and because it is difficult to find work there on the other hand. These people stay here and look for work here, which increases unemployment," he says.
Undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious when the high share of undeclared work is taken into account, which, according to INEGI, comprises 60.38 percent of the country’s employees who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work are the low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social and the Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a del Trabajo y Previsi<0xC3><0xB3>n Social.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa until September was 5352 pesos, which is much less than the general government average, which is 7375 pesos.
Decline in ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, the sharpest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last decade is recorded in 2011, with the ADI being $630,597 from January to June, down 87.74 percent from the $5,143,312 in the same period last year.
For its part, the Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de Desarrollo Econ<0xC3><0xB3>mico del Gobierno (Governmental Agency for Economic Development) recorded a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debts
In view of the economic crisis, the state government applied to the National Congress in July for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested to reactivate the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities. The National Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive impact of the debt on any of the economic sectors in the country could be determined until November.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first year of government made Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdé's incapacity for government obvious.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, Chairman of the C<0xC3><0xA1>mara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformaci<0xC3><0xB3>n (National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), stated that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
“Economic activity in Sinaloa this year has been really very poor. We need to work hard to recover the terrain lost this year and in 2012 we need to make a double effort. Everyone’s efforts, and especially the progress of the already well-coordinated government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated,” he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country’s economic development more difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the main impacts is a slowed economy that is not moving enough to produce an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. That is why we will close the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefining the Appeal
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Patronal de la Rep<0xC3><0xBA>blica Mexicana in Sinaloa, said that the state should be encouraged to engage in more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and lineage of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There is much to do
The chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that would better guide the government’s efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress in the government.
"There are areas where you can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The prosecutor’s office of the republic announced that the drug retailer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a public health crime – here the possession of marijuana intended for trade.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military in the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez street opposite guard post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and in the passenger seat, a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the district judge and the defendant remains in the detention centre.
Debts for construction work
According to Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda, the social constructions for migrants provided for in the programmes H<0xC3><0xA1>bitat, Rescate de Espacios P<0xC3><0xBA>blicos and 3x1 run the risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay.
The head of the city’s social development agency explained that although the construction programs are already advanced, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid its due funds, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, 25 percent of which fell to the state. Until now, only the Federaci<0xC3><0xB3>n and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the completion of the construction is expected.
"12 million they have to contribute, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they would have had to pay us a part already in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state had not fulfilled its obligations, so the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million at the beginning of his reign, which would be the amount that the central government would have had to pay.
"We had already done so in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programs continued and this year we had to get the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programs," he said.
Even though the public authorities were obliged to disburse these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance was requested to expedite the administrative work and disburse the outstanding share as soon as possible.
“Almost 12 million have to contribute, and although the year is already coming to an end, they haven’t given us a penny.”
The court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analog to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional actions filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, requiring the switch from analog to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including Supreme Court President Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the legislative decree detailing the switch to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, as it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes to allow the court to decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
The project for the lawsuit, drafted by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, proposed that the legislative decree be declared unconstitutional, since the regulations concerning radio and television are the responsibility of the Comisi<0xC3><0xB3>n Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), so that the legislative decree would respect the hierarchical principles and the law.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero themselves voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the legislative decree. After the adoption of the complaints, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero ceased to apply the legislative decree and ceased all activities for the establishment of digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the project, for which Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder government may not regulate with general regulations the measures that the public administration should take.
"Nor do I believe that doing so would affect the independence of the regulatory body", she also recalled that for constitutional reasons the central government is responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, as it is the head of state affairs.
Replacing analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place around the world in recent years, and it brings about better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the change, she said, was a postponement of the benefit of digitization, which is a decision in the public interest, which has not only technical aspects, "because it includes economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "made the action of the entire system necessary, according to the principle of economic direction by the state, they included a group of features that put the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital transformation, through the government, even though they had highly specialized facilities.
It cannot be concluded that the government interferes with the powers of Congress by issuing the contested legislative decree, because the laws passed by the legislature would be complied with,” she said.
The possibility of counting the votes in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor’s election is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not counted yet.
The possibility of individual counting of ballots is a reality this year in the elections in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governoral elections is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November 9 the electoral centre had adopted a series of regulations to harmonise local regulations with state reforms in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n had neither adapted his political constitution nor his electoral law nor his law on electoral justice to the reforms passed by Congress, so that they had not entered into force in this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Gazette within the deadlines provided for, with the argument that he still had objections to it.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional action filed by the local legislature and judged the state commissioner’s vote on the constitutional reforms to be “invalid and unlawful” as he did not have the right to “decide or veto it.”
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal stated in an interview on the possibility of counting the votes individually that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there was now the possibility that the local electoral authority could count the ballots partially or completely.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be counted in part. The results in the minutes do not agree; the record of the counting and calculation of votes is not available on file or is not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the fully completed ballots can be made if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the runner-up, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an express request from the party or coalition leader, who is the second of the mentioned candidates.
The total number of votes may also be counted if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is determined that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an express request from a representative of the party whose candidate has finished second, in which case the election packages that have been suspended from a partial count would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is just 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral minutes have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés trickled down on Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday evening. On Monday, the funeral procession and a funeral Mass took place.
According to family members, the lieutenant colonel's last will was to have his ashes scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After a tribute, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others who died in the accident, returned to the capital of Coahuila on a Mexican Air Force plane, with the closest people to the colonel attending the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At 12 noon, the ashes of the lieutenant colonel landed on the funeral hall, which is located on the boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends went.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, which was initiated by his former classmates from the technical high school diploma and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparation for the high school diploma.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and have his ashes spread over the Zapalinamé Mountains, which he had always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she is of the opinion that he stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to join the Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n Air Force School, Jalisco.
Some couldn’t believe it because they thought it would make him dizzy even on a lorry, but he always aspired to make his dream of becoming a pilot come true.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembers him as a good person: "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old, he went to Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n to graduate with his family member, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked best: flying a plane.
A final farewell
The Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was passed with all honors under the direction of the Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez. Her honors were given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military territory, the Mexican Air Force, school leaders and students of the technological educational institution of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and excelled in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew, which also housed the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority, crashed.
At 6.05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over in the forecourt of the barracks by the funeral service to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, where his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, siblings and other teachers, were already waiting for him.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot of land on Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military personnel presented the media with eleven people who had been arrested in the same locality in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered in an abandoned finca in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The event had taken place at kilometer 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers-by saw that the door of the country house, surrounded by a beige-brown wall, stood up fishing-boat-wide.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, which they immediately reported to the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark trousers, without shoes; next to him was another, dressed in a white top.
Nearly a metre away was the body of another person wearing a red T-shirt and blue trousers.
All three were on their stomachs.
According to the information received on the spot, the three people must have been murdered in another location, as no cartridge shells were found.
On the wall of the country house you can read inscriptions that one organized gang of criminals writes to another, in addition, several bullets were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The National Defence Secretariat presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal gang that was mainly active in the town of Cadereyta, and who are associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo (human hunting) and clandestine funerals.
According to the information made public, eight people were initially arrested on November 11 in the settlement of Los Alveros and a prisoner was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured, and the detainees confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12, at 6 a.m., military personnel found a car without license plates with two occupants on their guard in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13, at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are accused of secret funerals in the towns of General Ter<0xC3><0xA1>n, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday, the new Italian government was formed
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce the new government to face up to the crisis that has pushed Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce the new government to face up to the crisis that has pushed Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present the President with the results of talks with political parties to form a government.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," he told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The frame is now well set," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is struggling against a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to an intolerable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package called for by Europoliticians to regain the ailing confidence in Italy.
Pressure on Monti’s haste was exacerbated by the fluctuating market situation, which has put a 7% interest on Italian government bonds for 10 years, as Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of Italian industrial association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government to the best of our ability."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly increased by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are destined to produce good results,” said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a government, which is made up mostly of technocrats and which Monti is currently forming.
Support from Parliament
Monti’s new government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Resisting his efforts or delaying reforms could once again cause a devastating attack by the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also exerting pressure by pointing out that Monti’s failure is a disaster.
Monti began his debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women’s organizations.
Tuesday evening, the session is to be completed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who set in motion an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a breath of fresh air towards the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, the cost of Italian government bonds has again reached critical limits as a result of uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
A rescue of Italy with a national debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue package.
Monti said his government would have to wait until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, an indication of their concerns about the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the inclusion of people from political life.
Spaniards have more opportunities to play than the Ticos
Of the 22 players retrieved from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on their hump.
In Costa Rica, only one of the 22 invited players has played 50 games.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries lined up for the friendly game, which takes place today at 3.05 p.m. in the National Stadium of San José, are compared.
While the world and European champions, the number one in FIFA’s monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selection matches, the tricolour team has only defence player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
The Spanish players, who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Star League) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England, have the opportunity every year to participate in numerous home games (League and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, there are the experiences with the Spanish Fury in complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the football world championships.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international encounters within the framework of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see how the Spanish team draws their last register: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who reached a tie with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta last Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against the tricolour team today and Spain set a new record of 127 international matches.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, player of the Barcelona football club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian team that had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke’s midfielder, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
Carles Puyol also approaches the number 100 with 97 games.
Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the Ticos side and close to Michael Umana are left winger J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az with 48 games and forward Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five games went to over 30: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The ones with the fewest games.
Fewer than 30 games have been played in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
The national team has less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest are not even close to the 20s.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, Costa Rica's V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson haven't made their debut yet.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam’s bassist Jeff Ament says the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
The group’s bassist and co-founder, Jeff Ament, gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day they perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 pm together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You can read an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in the online edition of La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us.
This is just the second time we’ve played in South and Central America, and so far it’s been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica once for a holiday. It is such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few more days.
It’s exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted. They experience the days before the concert intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have taken so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn’t that a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve put on in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played a couple of huge shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and we love the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world for this.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, these are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we learned about people who love surfing.
With a view of the tour you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we also set no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
What's up?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs, and everyone likes a different song, so it’s not easy to decide which one we’re going to play.
If we add two or three songs that we haven’t played in a while, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs, otherwise they might be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
For starters, I don’t think any of us have imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years, and it looks like a dream.
We continue to count on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are excited to create music.
We are lucky to be able to travel to places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean to you to have actively participated in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great bands.
We are good friends with the people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band emerges from a city, but it is unusual for five or ten groups to come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We’re still happy to be friends with them all and we’re honored to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual for a band like yours to have stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we are all lucky to still be alive and we take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give every individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't be better off.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy, but thanks to your success, you have always been able to do what you wanted.
How do you find balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often because it’s too easy to fall in love with this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came for the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has brought to life, without being obsessive about being a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and it was great in the beginning.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and therefore chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos of several groups and we liked this band the best. So we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This will certainly be exciting.
Why do you change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter every time you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to mind.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
From so many+
Among the first to come to my mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fad?
I think we all don't feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone else that came up at the same time. If they’re still important today, I think that’s great because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
What's up?
That's interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit frivolous, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive about them.
Both of them shed tears when I heard Ed play them, they're very dark songs.
I believe that as you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - it affects your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly embody that for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to examine the muscle loss of his legs, his family doctor informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who served 25 years in prison for violating human rights during his tenure (1990-2000), has multiple illnesses, including tongue cancer, which operates and is under control four times.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of Congress and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neopl<0xC3><0xA1>sicas to determine the reason for his pain and loss of muscle in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that he believed Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but he did not wish to do so because he believed he was innocent.
He was operated on four times on tongue cancer and lost 18 kilos of weight, as well as other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been in the Direcci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la polic<0xC3><0xAD>a detention centre since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian Army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n next Wednesday, which, according to the Uruguayan president, will be the culmination of his booked-out schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara is "suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica sought Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s support over the incident with France when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that still act as tax havens, which Uruguay rejected and prompted a request from his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world. Since January of this year, an agreement has been in place on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the concretization of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) "grey list", which states countries that have not adopted all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
At the business level, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The moustache installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but so far never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which is coming to the stores around the world this month, has been tailored from the start to the features of the Nintende 3DS portable console, which can be played three-dimensionally without special glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, who is responsible for the Nintendo-specialized press in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game from Nintendo that has been developed for this console from the beginning", because until now, successful articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo’s spokesman stressed that while it is three-dimensional, “Super Mario 3D Land” is an “affordable” video game that allows for fast, fluid play.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to capture the less apprehensive users.
After that, the experts can "turn a second round" about the different game levels, which are becoming more and more difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but to overcome the obstacles without becoming a victim of the "optical effects", it is always necessary to play three-dimensionally.
This trip of Super Mario into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the character to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the latest editions: the mustache installer must overcome dangerous platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player comes across news on the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom vouches for the extradition of Portillo to the United States
Guatemala’s President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he would allow the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to hold him responsible in the United States for the $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
Thus, the trial of the US request for extradition of Portillo ends, so that he can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed his decision was based on independence from judicial power and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that during his administration he had not interfered in court decisions and had accepted all extradition requests of which he was informed.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n is extradited for murder and serious assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom’s action is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional authorities have been exhausted for the conviction of the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited if his legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzlement of 120 million quetzals in the Department of Defense during his administration, which was preceded by extradition, but the Minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organisation was created to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the welfare organization Trinijove have led to important results: In this quarter of a century, 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion have been supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are more than 100 jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, a balance was drawn yesterday at an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people took part.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with a low level of education, without work, with drug problems at risk of marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by numerous persons in charge of institutions and institutions who have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The participation of political representatives from different directions during the election period demonstrated the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of the former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and current left-green city councillor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and Jaume Lanaspa, Director General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was born in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far "is a good foundation".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a role model that knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives people in difficulty hope.
“The economic crisis is nothing new for the club and the work it does,” he said.
Occupied house, where giant parties were held, was cleared
The owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of house No. 51 on Balmes street have come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building at noon yesterday, which they had illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge celebrations that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The eviction was carried out by court order without any police intervention.
After the eviction, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the property manager confirmed.
The squatters, who occupied 11 of the 13 dwellings of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply, painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated that lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had declined by 80% since the beginning of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the squatters made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks at three euros, while these in the discotheque cost 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the leisure spot had been reported by the neighbors for disturbance of rest, while according to her, the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the occupants of the house, and in particular from the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which according to the angry neighbors in recent weeks became more and more longer.
The head of the disco explained that the harassment was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that they have received more complaints from the neighbors in recent weeks.
The leader of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the city council of Barcelona, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had last week called for the building to be cleared immediately and to get a grip on the problems of bourgeois coexistence and the coming down of the district.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that the squatters had penetrated all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments in recent months.
In this sense, he added that “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to crack down on the antisocial acts in the building.”
Yesterday, another building in the district of Nou Barris was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., police approached Montral Street No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people try to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects, apart from the disputes over the fees, agree with the tender.
The call for tenders for the 16 gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-disappearing Corporaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its smear on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It has even been compared in numbers to New York’s Central Park.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many again the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in a north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a nature park plays with this idea.
The role model was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the yogi bear.
In September, the city issued a huge invitation to tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's the case, or someone's going to set up gates on the land.
The question is self-evident: Collserola, park or mountain?
The invitation to tender is not only from an organizational point of view, but also with a view to a reflection on the city, the topic of discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this old caste who meet in the elevator can fall back on.
And it is precisely this fact that provides the material for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n "it is necessary" to speak after the attack on the coast about the "Front on the Mountains", as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who about the green apples, has not been carried out.
“One should start from the principle that Barcelona’s largest park is the beach.
Partly because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Gates of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": one must not think of it "as accesses to a park, but as a limitation of areas on which to act."
Modol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with urban planning experience, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers".
Dangers resulting from the "uncertainty that the design of a public space today entails" after the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan singing" in the area of the forum.
The first fear is your own limitation on what can be built.
“Limiting something always means defining the next step,” i.e. going beyond it.
"You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current ones [referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who adheres more closely to the question, says simplified, the Collserola side, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Collserola Patronate, which should not "befall on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guide letter, which allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubt" as to whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams created ("just the right thing," he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, since in the terms of the tender a global view of Collserola is missing: "There were 16 competitions in cross-section," he says, "on the mountain-sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area in its entirety."
This, at least in his case, has led to him taking part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the gate's architect.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length is equipped in such a way that a soft transition between the city and green zones is created.
Casino awards Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal who goes free
After 72 days of silence, Casino Red’s attorney freed the Mayor of Monterrey’s brother from the lawsuit being filed against him for alleged extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is released after the representative of Casino Red pardoned him before the Second Criminal Court of the district, which is leading the trial against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s, who allegedly forces him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the betting house.
After the criminal complaint, the public prosecutor’s office opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the panist mayor, who was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to the Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He stayed at this place 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico had dismissed the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Centre for allegedly bribing the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos, but he only remained in the medium-security wing for a few hours because of death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an inmate of the municipal prison of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza.
On 25 October, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the district, sent him a detention order, which found that after nearly two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to convict Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house to open it in return.
This Monday, Casino Red’s plenipotentiary, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor’s brother, to release him, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico assigned to the court, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez whether he had remedied the damage and which of the owners of the betting house had expressed his forgiveness, but the lawyer withheld the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is acquitted and no appeals can be brought against the proceedings, and no damages are claimed.
After the hearing of the representative of the betting house at 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, went to the municipal prison of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to inform Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s that he had been acquitted and his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the court’s order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come gives details of the plane crash that killed Secretary of State Francisco Blake and seven others.
The Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation into the accident, in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people were killed, indicate that the helicopter with its whole intact structure directly hit the ground without the pilot being able to initiate an emergency landing.
Speaking at a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before take-off that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wings at 25 meters height had contact with trees, with the helicopter losing the fuselage, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for transporting personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the plane had come down.
"No aircraft parts were found elsewhere during the search, the impact affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has an inclination of 7 to 30 degrees.
At the moment, the priority is to get the results as soon as possible, but this could take several months, maybe even a year.
For his part, Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, General Director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter had flown from the Estado Mayor Presidencial on impact at cruising speed and the aircraft had fallen onto a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
During the onward flight towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State, some low-hanging clouds were raised.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with better visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar record of the helicopter are the same, and there may have been no loss of control of the aircraft or deviation from the flight path prior to the impact.
Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter had collided from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered remnants of the aircraft suggests that the helicopter with its undamaged structure had hit the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft do not indicate fire or explosion at the scene of the accident.
The latest results indicate several ground contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is sloping and has an inclination of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a meticulous search in an area that went beyond the restricted area at the scene of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, reinforcing the assumption that the intact aircraft structure had collided with the ground.
MSS Announces Research Protocol to Find the Gene for Obesity
The Social Security Institute of Mexico is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for childhood and adolescent obesity under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence", with which to find the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, head of the Unidad de Investigaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Médica en Bioqu<0xC3><0xAD>mica (Department of Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers has been established.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate program at the Instituto Nacional de Salud P<0xC3><0xBA>blica (INSP) and the Centro de Investigaci<0xC3><0xB3>n y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to take part in the study. Interested parties can come to the IMSS sports fields in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are carried out every Saturday from 8.00 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation began on the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and continues since October 8 on the sports field of Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt (in the east of the state of México).
When the target of 500 to 600 investigators is reached, the study will be continued on the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and completed on that of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn about the factors and role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Diabetes Day, he stated that the aim was for three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 years to complete nutrition-related questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and family history of disease to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He further stated that on the Saturdays mentioned, the study subjects were measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure was controlled and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes associated with childhood obesity) were determined.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez stressed that this study was being carried out in response to the concerns of health workers about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys conducted in 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent, while obesity also increased dramatically," said the IMSS specialist.
He stated that the search for genetic markers is justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico is different from that of other peoples.
He stated that an average Mexican is 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn off the excess of energy (calories) consumed so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the study participants would be a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information would be kept confidential and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the measurement results and suggest to them lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three basic factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport, instead of walking short distances.
The high caloric intake, i.e. an increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake, as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM, developed polymer-modified asphalts to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If attention were paid to the signs emanating from the road surface, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 potholes if the rainy season breaks out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (urban area of the Valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assuring that even the laying out and maintenance of the potholes will be significantly reduced.
In his talk "Technical Impact Holes", given on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera felt that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road surface and thus avoid the occurrence of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, one part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphaltene - and the other part a low - the so-called malthene. Together, they give the road surface its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
Tough-elastic behavior of asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very viscous and at 50°C it is almost solid, while at very low temperatures it becomes brittle.
"This means that the resistance of asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in a day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer explained.
The FQ researcher noted that the majority of streets in Mexico City have a flexible road surface composed of six layers of material, the last three of which contained asphalt.
Between the top layers is a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer had been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Above the wear layer," he explained, "a final layer is laid, the so-called base layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tires, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it must produce friction.
The one that receives and distributes the most forces, the base layer also needs a reasonable thickness and the material of which it is made must be maintained.
Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially water,” he said, “because it significantly affects the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes wet, water penetrates the layer and escapes only with difficulty, causing a softening of all layers of the road surface and, as a result, the appearance of potholes.
When a pothole is created," he said, "the top layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that would have to be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause of potholes, so the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be proportional to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is adhered to in order to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes could be repaired easily and without using high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected that Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th title.
Once again Valle del Cauca went empty-handed in awarding the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to be content to be on the winner’s podium, to display a silver crown and the ribbon that identifies her as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico took the crown and the cedar, the department is already on 14 mistitles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in the hands of Mar87, among the proclaimed misses include: G<0xC3><0xA1>l<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xAD>a (1987), G<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>s (1987), G<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xA1>s (1987), G<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xA1>s (1987), G<0xC3><0xA1>s (1987), G<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB1>a (1987), G<0xC3><0xB3>r<0xC3><0xB1>a (1919), G<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xA1>r (1919), G<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>r (1919), G<0xC3><0xB3>r (1919), G<0xC3><0xB3>r (1919), G<0xC3><0xB3>r (1919), G<0xC3><0xB3>r (1919), G<0xC3><0xA1>r (1919), G<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3><0xB3>l<0xC3>
The big question that many are asking today is: What was missing?
The result corresponds to the demise of a great favourite who, at every performance, had shown that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing had she been elected Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that had also been given to the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered decisive for the jury’s decision to appoint her as First Miss is that she did not convince the answer to the question “Which book influenced you the most and why?” put to her by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe quite a bit in literature, I think it's a way of civilizing myself, ultimately I believe that the book that was most influential for my childhood is 'The Little Prince', a quite profound book.
I am currently reading Guilt and Atonement, a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a beautiful book called Passions.
An answer which met with little love for the other, firstly because of the concept of ‘civilization’ and secondly because it had not concretely explained the way in which each book she mentioned had influenced her.
But after the conclusion of the ceremony, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little The Little Prince. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the preferred one, who welcomed all the applause and who had received all the prizes in advance (gastronomy contest Easter, public vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the queen, who therefore could not shine on the stage."
And this was evident at their first performance in a bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at their two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although she was certain of their presence, she lacked the strength and momentum exhibited by the representatives of Magdalena and Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the programme "Como en casa" on the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition will not be queen after all".
In addition, Valle went out of his way to the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
Two days before the international jury was assembled, Lucy Doughty stated that she was looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, on the fact that she had already worked on projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle, with her defects of the derriere and fibrosis noted in her stomach area, had sinned, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for <0x60>natural beauty' with a healthy body, good dietary habits and responsible physical work.
The Queen’s coach, Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, “but her problem with fibrosis on the abdomen, which was, to be honest, hardly noticeable to me, depressed her score on the last day.”
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
“Operations are okay, but Valle didn’t know how to get them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay for."
Because of this award, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, after the appearance in a bathing suit, a cruel prediction arose that was to come true at night. It was rumoured that Raymundo had given Melina a consolation prize in order not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether this is true or not, the fact is that Melina is starting her reign year from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had missed the crown.
Such was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4th, a lophoscopist from the Cali Public Prosecutor’s Office (CTI) who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) said: “Alfonso Cano” by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez was on standby this week, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in communities of Choc<0xC3><0xB3>, where he often had to spend five days in the jungle to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
In the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was instructed to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew by helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he was supposed to identify two bodies, and that it was suspected that one could be that of the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was to take the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n S<0xC3><0xA1>enz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was with the examination, he could not identify it because of its physical appearance, because this was not in the least similar to the pictures he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a peasant in the area, wore no glasses, and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a trowel and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the print sheet.
He had seen correctly: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, this Puerto Tejada-born man was in charge of telling the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, that he was indeed the head of the FARC.
Searching for clues
For a dactyloscope from the Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n in Cali, the tribute given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez at a press conference on the use against "Cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify corpses, they also support investigations into murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many offenders present false identity documents or they do not have one.
We'll take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher told us that in the event of a theft, he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had supported himself with his hand exactly at this point, when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for taking fingerprints. But in this case, we were able to take the impression of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints can also be used to exonerate or burden murder suspects.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
During the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be a suspect, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that “the fingerprints were taken from the object with chemical or physical reagents.”
When they appear, a planting trowel or tape is used to take them along.
After that, the prints are sent to the asif, which is the criminal database, or to the civil registry.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identity papers,” said the expert from the CTI.
He said that not everything is as it is depicted in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that glitters is gold, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if a corresponding comparison is made.
The “outrages” challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded into tents in Zuccotti Square.
A large part complied with the eviction order and changed its location to a nearby park.
Members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities this Tuesday as they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square with a court order after being cleared of the square at dawn and attempting to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, seeking to gain access to it with a court order that allowed the "outraged" to re-camp at the site, while another part of the movement complied with the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where nine were arrested.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp on the square, we'll meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to the Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the Ocupy Wall Street movement's spokespersons.
Bray explained that the "outrageous" response to the eviction of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, came to court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forcible eviction of the square and allowing protesters to camp.
In addition, the "Indignants" occupied a new park located at the intersection of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey and owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray can not give exact numbers. He assured the Efe news agency that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that hundreds of people have gathered here, including a delegation of religious leaders as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square (a privately owned site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday to analyse the legality of the dawn eviction.
Some of the protesters driven from the square carried and distributed photocopies of this court order and even gave them to some police officers guarding the square, resulting in “some small clashes,” Bray reported, who reported that some policemen had beaten protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from removing members of Occupy Wall Street from the square, as well as the application of "laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other items they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that as a result of this court order, the re-opening of the square to the public and the demonstrators had been cancelled, and he pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves in this place with tents and sleeping bags.
The mayor personally defended the dawn eviction of Zuccotti Square, in which nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the protesters "violate the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to clear the square because it had “turned into a place where people didn’t come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people,” because “some businesses have received threats” and residents “are concerned about their quality of life.”
"The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not protecting the interests of North American workers," added the movement's spokesman, who accused the mayor of "not respecting press freedom."
Occupy Wall Street officials informed that they were considering organizing “major actions” for Thursday, along with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months the protests have been going on since Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson is in the TV Christmas show The Virgin Mary
Along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on December 1 on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen’s assistant in “Home Improvement,” lifeguard in “Baywatch,” rabbit in “Playboy,” rock musician Tommy Lee’s wife, and now the actress and model on a Canadian TV Christmas show will be the Virgin Mary.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on December 1 on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson - who is also for the distribution on the Internet of a self-made porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as the Virgin Mary with a doll in the lap, which is supposed to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently worked as a host on Charlie Sheen's show "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as a Jesus child.
The Christmas program of CTV not only relies on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentinian model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, Bublé had called the North American Kim Kardashian as a "whore" at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the free-fall spiral from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis and the worst catastrophe Japan had experienced since World War II.
The government’s initial estimates in Tokyo put the property damage at $300,000, a blow that appears to be weakening despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of cases, the July-September data on gross domestic product finally served to complete this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% compared to the extrapolated rate for the year.
The figure measured in the second quarter - in Japan, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the real shift in the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has woken up thanks in particular to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, spurred by growing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has confided in the domestic market after the yen — the Japanese currency — plunged into one of the “refugee currencies” of investors fleeing the eurozone’s debt crisis and gloomy forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that weighs like a tombstone on export companies’ accounts.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony attributed their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the yen.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
“You have to pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, the country’s secretary of state for economic policy.
The perspectives are really not very uplifting.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member states showed clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the brakes would have been applied to the greatest economic potentials.
Because he dropped by four tenths to go 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below that average, which is 100, after dropping eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens is doubting again.
Papadimos says austerity measures will be passed, but conservatives won't sign written deal
With the increased risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also further lost in the labyrinth that leads out of the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the “consensus” of the new Greek transitional government is more a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly being substantiated by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there are no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the 100 days agreed upon when he was appointed may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and in no way withdraw his demand for new elections on the scheduled date, February 19.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, reform of disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's statement does not dispel doubts about his stance: "We have committed ourselves to support the transitional government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens desperately needs, making it clear that he would not approve of a commitment to meet the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the Papandreu referendum poker game, reiterated yesterday that its demand was not to be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties “did not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible”.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the troika "very soon" came back to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed for the payment of the sixth section" of 8000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek ball still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "predominant" position in relation to this type of financing.
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofia of Spain recalled yesterday that over the past two decades, Spain has become the world’s second donor to this means of international cooperation, its “essence” being “an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity based on trust in people.”
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the fifth World Summit on microcredit in Valladolid, convinced that there was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "particularly the goal of reducing the number of people living with incomes of less than one dollar per day to below the poverty line".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the beneficiary network "to the very last corner of the world and it is carrying out this task responsibly", noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will come from the summit, which will last until Thursday, "will guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have had many successes" and "are facing many challenges."
The summit on microcredit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for pushing "two fundamental goals".
The Queen said that the goal is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households will cross the poverty line.
The concept of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the way Muhammad Yunus “initiated years ago”, which Queen Sofia judges as an “act of justice and recognition”.
She described the father of this financial instrument as an “admirable idealist dedicated to the fight against poverty” and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999 and Canada in 2006. All of them "have seen continuous development," the Queen said, whose commitment to this project earned her yesterday the rating of "family chief" in Valladolid and "provocate of the poor."
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her talk by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is “an ethical imperative” for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it is a mistake to tie development aid to periods of economic booms, because it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez felt that microcredit was a “serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty” and that the governments of the industrialized countries must now work “more than ever” according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, applauded "success", "marginalized" people who are always at the door" to give "hope" and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its doors, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU president on the basis of universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU) on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig passed for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme, but prevailed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy those activists who consider the government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy to be too lax tomorrow.
The European Commission's presidential proposal proposed by the Bureau was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against it, and ten had abstained.
The standing ovation lasting several minutes, which initially applied to Angela Merkel and a few hours later to Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble on the basis of their intervention decrees, left no doubt on the part of the three finance ministers associated with Europe.
The main idea of the Chancellor, as well as the motions, is that the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because “nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro”.
For the Chancellor, “the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe”.
This could be reflected by a modification of the Lisbon Treaty, which reinforces the control of the European Union, with regard to the budgetary policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote to give a face to Europe.
However, this is definitely one of the proposals adopted by Congress, which was clearly sponsored by Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone has been reached.
Likewise, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal of weighting each country on the ECB’s Executive Board according to the weighting of the individual economies, which would obviously entail a strengthening of Germany’s position.
The Chancellor, who was concerned about calming the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticise arrogant Germany.
To the extent that the European application devotes a paragraph to the importance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that two centuries ago Leipzig was the centre of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the sick report fraud represent?
After the family allowances, the UMP and the government are now tackling the sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund and deliver a speech on the issue of social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which starts from the desire to put the economy to the test, but on the other hand is no less a harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee sick leave reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government is aiming to introduce a fourth maternity leave day before taking into account a sick leave for employees in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick employee would lose the salary of four days without the approval of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" threatens to provoke anger, but would help to bring in 280 million euros.
And this would be accompanied by another measure of a rather symbolic nature: to grant state officials an unpaid maternity leave in the event of illness (so far, in contrast to the three maternity leave days in the private sector, there is no maternity leave period for them).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority are also rekindling the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with absenteeism at work.
“Controls will be much more important, and beyond that, they are to be reimbursed if required,” Xavier Bettrand warned on Sunday, November 13 in front of RTL’s microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the area of sick leave seems somewhat disproportionate.
In fact, it has been the subject of constant observation since 2002, as well as of political offensives that have borne fruit most often.
The French are no longer sick more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first dwell on the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund CNAM, more than 237 million euros of daily severance payments were paid in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of the health care sector, daily severance payments in 2008 accounted for 5% of health care expenditure, amounting to 11.3 billion euros.
This figure includes 46% of maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% of sick leave, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
and 2.5% health care spending.
In 2010, the French were granted an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
Another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, clarifies that 37% of health reports in 2010 were of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months, and 11% above.
Compared to its European neighbours, French workers do not tend to be incapacitated any more than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absence rate (disease or otherwise justified) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud on sick leave accounts for a negligible proportion of undeclared work.
There is only a slight degree of fraud here.
The reinforcement of legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic checks on sick leave reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public college for education and training of technicians and engineers) under 1.5 million controls found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term sick leave reports realized, i.e. in 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
In the systematically controlled cases of sick leave lasting more than 45 days, among 1.2 million cases, 11% were "unadjusted or unjustified", i.e. 132,000.
In total, this amounts to 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have claimed sick leave.
A digit that represents only a weak measure compared to, for example, that of undeclared work.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a factual report on this issue published in July, this represents between €9 billion and €15 billion in tax loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus considerably more than the defraudation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment program to intercept its economy.
This was announced on Monday, November 14, by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament, adding that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to complete this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," the Prime Minister said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's involvement within the eurozone was "at stake", he added.
Accordingly, Mr. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit "by the 9%" of gross domestic product from today until the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his approval on Monday to the already approved measures with regard to an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but sent ahead that his party would not agree to an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting of his New Democracy party.
He had agreed to the reduction of the budget deficit and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of 8 billion euros without a written guarantee from all parties about their support for the planned measures, replied that his word would suffice and he would not sign anything under pressure from outsiders.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, according to a panel of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, and beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a denial of death attitude.
Only 9% of Canadians actually engage in talking to their doctor about conditions under which they would like to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada involving six experts linked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in order to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia, where this choice occurs, in patients who are considered capable of making such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts cite a recently published survey by the independent company EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “medical death care in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to take on the issue of death.”
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians’ desire to die at home, 68.6% of those ultimately die in hospital.
Across the country, Quebec has the highest rate of hospitalized deaths, at 86%.
In the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report’s authors come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already expressed its intention not to make any changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
But according to the experts, who have also inspected all those countries whose approach legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would lead to abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide, by incompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, there are far more cases of such violations, especially in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
“Accompanied suicide is also practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal here,” Downie said.
Canadians support euthanasia
Recall that, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey, 85% of Canadians had already expressed support for euthanasia, believing that it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanasia is legalised does not mean that the message is that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
With regard to the people who have already practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As far as maintenance or discontinuation of the means in patients is concerned, the situation turns out to be less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest in their list of recommendations that it should be stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of the means for which a legally valid rejection has been available should not be considered criminal.
The panel of experts also demands that health care professionals should be trained in the task of respecting the end-of-life withdrawal of funds, without fear of criminal prosecution.
The panel explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, and beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the means of pain relief or life-saving measures already widely used in Canadian institutions for health care, the Panel calls for at least consideration of these, as these served no more than euthanasia to reduce physical pain and these related to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some health care experts have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada Expert Report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the undersigned experts as, among other things, "extreme", as they do not set any limits on the euthanasia practice in the final phase of patients.
"This opens the doors to a situation where anyone who is life-weary and older than 18 years old is asking another person to assist him in his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place individual responsibility above all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there are “guidelines and obligations in a society.”
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, has also expressed “a strong opposition” to the report’s conclusions, which she called a “pro-euthanasia manifesto.”
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly doubts the reports regarding the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan Calls on President Assad to Resign
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad yesterday demonstrated before the authorities of the foreign ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assad, which, thanks to Russia’s support, opposes it and rejects a “conspiracy” directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League’s exclusion of Syria, the European Union tightened its sanctions on Damascus, despite Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, taking a stand in favor of President Assad’s resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the acting Arab prime minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "depose his authority in Syria", in which around forty civilians and members of the government power were already killed.
“If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he would resign, but beyond that he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life,” the king of Jordan, Syria’s neighbour, told the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, had complained that the Turkish mediation attempts addressed to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must leave," he said, referring to Syria, the neighboring country to which Turkey is taking a steadily rougher stance.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "intensification of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have taken an increasingly sharp tone in the face of the repression in Syria," said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government power in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria have died, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed in "fires and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs.
At a press conference, however, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim felt that the country was "driving towards the end of the crisis".
Incidentally, he has reacted strongly to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considers to be a “dangerous step”.
"Syria will not give in," he added, adding that "the plots forged against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now investigating a “protection mechanism for civilians” and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from repression by the regime, which he believes is encapsulating itself in its "paranoia".
A planned new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov yesterday described the Arab League’s decision as “incorrect” in order to avoid any possible sanctions on Damascus, even though China had already warned Syria to implement the exit plan.
Italy
Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian Prime Minister, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that demands "victims" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today’s meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in parliament, which is relatively composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting the President-in-Office of the Council.
For his part, Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had been anxious to wait for Mario Monti to give Parliament a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by M. Monti of a cancellation list, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness of the stock and bond markets took its time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government as well as a government program, he stressed, noting that it was "certain that the markets would show patience and understanding".
His appointment by the president was welcomed by the markets at the outset, but the turmoil had intensified again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The incumbent prime minister should form a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had emphasized that he would also like to involve "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the parliamentary vote of confidence by Friday.
Since taking up his post, M. Monti has committed himself to work urgently towards the goal of making Italy the "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy itself does not change, taking into account the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its 2013 budget balance target despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has in particular requested new tougher measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, Italy's chief executive, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need to boost the economy, as a country that has no growth at all, cannot respect deficit indicators.
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of epoch" in Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" as well as "another Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown in this case is the longevity of his rod.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy has to pay from now to April 2012 for 200 billion euros of government bonds.
Russian Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Energy Program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop an explosive device that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA) and other documents issued by this UN agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA expressed its “serious concern” over a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to an in-depth study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked for more than three decades since the early 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the explosion-generated production of synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he is said to have left the center to found a company in Kiev that produces "nano-diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him in 1995 to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine.
Before returning to Russia, he worked on an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the AIEA mentioned "strong evidence that the Iranian development of a nuclear explosive system" had been supported by the work of a foreign expert, who was not only highly skilled in this technique, but, as a member of state told the Agency, had worked over his entire professional career on this technology directly on the military nuclear energy program of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes and offenses against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racially or religiously motivated violent crimes have either decreased slightly or increased only slightly over the same period, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, whereas a 13% increase in violent crimes against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes globally were recorded.
The total figure of "hate-motivated crimes" has risen to 6,628 cases in very weak terms, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences of motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a slowdown in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," Human Rights First said. "The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," said Paul Legendre, the organization's executive director.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to combat these abuses,” he added, adding that this could be done by improving police attitudes toward “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" is presented in American federal law as a legacy from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence directed against race, color, religion or descent, and now also includes crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and is more and more similar to Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter introduced changes to its platform’s presentation on Monday, specifically allowing its users to monitor the activities of those following their posts, making the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" allow a better readable live understanding of the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") are being followed and who are following your messages.
This allows to find out if they allow to track their messages, if they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday, "in August with a small percentage of users," said Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner in front of the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, endowed with something esoteric-looking wording (RT for referenced repetition of another person's contribution). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus a compar
In the network, users debated about this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" about the Internet.
“This is useless, intrusive and is too similar to Facebook,” writes <0x40>jemb123.
"The 'Activity' feature will help me better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," <0x40>dannykronstrom said.
Austria
Entry of a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution
The government of the large social-democratic/Christian-democratic coalition, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid a possible degradation by rating agencies in the top credit rating of Austria (AAA).
It was the Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian debt is 74.6%, that is, far above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency had not fallen from AAA to AA+ in one fell swoop, we would have to pay three billion euros in additional interest every year,” argued Michael Spindelegger, vice-chancellor and Christian Democrat foreign minister.
Austria is also making a call at the Brussels summit of the eurozone member states on 26 October: Heads of state and government at that time had demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 as well as a return to the public account balance in the constitution or by enacting an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government for this purpose is similar to the "German model", since Germany had been the first European country to include such a "rule" in the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, from 2017 onwards, the state’s structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas regional states as well as municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The objective is to eliminate budget debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Strong yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention in the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would re-intervene in the currency markets if the yen continued to rise.
“If we find excessive volatility in the yen’s exchange rate, we will intervene as we did last time,” Noda said.
On Tuesday, the yen was again close to the historic levels that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against dollars to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is in the process of setting a new record against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has risen above it on a regular basis, doped by purchases from investors who see the yen as a “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro has slipped below the symbolic bar of 105 yen close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the cost of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn from abroad by Japanese companies, as they exchange them into national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and tsunami on March 11, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast)," said M. Noda, who fears that this inflation of the yen could kill the weak recovery already in the bud.
The third world economic power regained traction for the first time this year, with growth of -1.5% in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter, thanks to the sudden increases in exports and consumption of households "sealed" by the disaster.
However, the prime minister estimates that the yen’s inflation does not “reflect the economic foundations of Japan.”
For his part, Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to invalidate the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, has informed that the BoJ has already initiated "appropriate measures", stating that no additional currency loosening is expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to repay the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of cover it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates skyrocket, stock markets backtrack
The contagion risk of the debt crisis is constantly undermining the European key figures.
Despite the inauguration of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
The stock markets, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are also drifting a little more into negative territory this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
“Due to new tensions over government bond yields in the troubled eurozone, global equity markets are continuing to release some of their recent gains.
“Investors are nervous and are only too well aware of the risk of contagion,” said Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which, in turn, is suffering from renewed fears among market participants that the debt crisis will continue in Europe, had closed with a bear market of 0.7%.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe, and trading is moving along a limited range of variations as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone harms the single currency, which continues its bait until Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollars, i.e. it fell by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it has declined after the CDU, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, which had gathered in Congress on Monday, approved a motion that specifically provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Loan interest rates in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of the Italian bonds reached 6.85% for 10 years, the one of the Spanish title matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti demanded more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the 27 October summit of the Eurozone was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the visor of the markets, as on Sunday the parliamentary elections will take place in the country.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
Expecting growth figures in the eurozone
Statistically, France recorded household consumption-driven economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the bearish figures of the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it’s the fourth quarter that worries economic experts the most.
For its part, Germany recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
An initial projection of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of another recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, it is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an electoral meeting as an opportunity to reflect on this issue as well as on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the total economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by the year 2050 if a huge proportion of the world’s population does not have to forgo a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources must be mitigated in order to continue to produce electricity consistently, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to fight against climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find a substitute source capable of substitution, nor in Switzerland, which only intends to build last-generation nuclear power plants.
Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima, has decided to add another unit to its park by recommissioning the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, which focuses on renewable energy sources, is occasionally presented as a model, reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, especially from Russia, as a result of the increased use of imported gas, and an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for reflection.
On the one hand, Denmark is the European leader in terms of wind energy, from which it obtains 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, it is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
As the price of energy is a key competitive factor in the globalised economy and a guarantee of stability for industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a sharp increase in the price of energy, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys have shown that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are just as unwilling to pay as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Recall that our country’s energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a plethora of specialized small and medium-sized companies to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France were to decide to leave nuclear power, it would fall victim to a large part of these SMEs and the annual €6 billion in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would commission an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the decline of its producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one must admit that there is no such thing as a work of the devil as a miracle means of generating electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy demonstrate the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a safety authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent checks in existing plants, such as the construction site in Flamanville.
Their work teams, which have made a name for themselves due to their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the idea of security.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; thus it went on without consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was evoked by reactor construction as well as human error.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented proportions, which caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident as much as it did from the previous two.
As a result of this approach and a cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft that enables it to withstand such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a stop at Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by giving them the freedom to take the leading position in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is imperative and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party manoeuvres dominate a debate that determines our country’s economic, social and financial situation as well.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overloading of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the numbers, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment directed at foreign students by the authorities had shaped the newsreels, the Minister of the Interior had casually announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "needed no talents, bricklayers or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right was the tone of Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 declared that "900,000 unemployed people, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", on the left by Michel Rocard, who in 1990 had stated that France "cannot absorb all the poverty in the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
The fear of the invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided in 2005 both from the right and from the left.
From both camps, the immigrants were perceived as a burden for the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity one is willing to admit to immigrants.
Francois Hollande’s program is limited to banalities that indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our “migration problems”.
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, can potentially affect the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remind us in a recent paper that summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of the migrant flood on economic growth, wages and jobs.
Restricting immigration would undermine growth and harm the labour market.
Concerns about migrants’ influence are based on the idea that they threaten to substitute the local workforce, especially the less skilled, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than local wage workers, as they are mainly engaged in occupations in sectors that are technically unworkable.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract much local wage workers, the more skilled among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not aligned with the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity between locals and migrants also has a positive effect on the influx of immigrants on wages and domestic labour market conditions.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants leads to an inclusive, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas introduced by immigrants is conducive to economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute to the welfare system net, in European countries an average of about 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that a person immigrating to Germany at the age of 30 earns a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over his lifetime on average.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring about the missing intersections "with the teeth" at the start of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which were intended to deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable commodity; it is also a sensitive commodity.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had endured the entire 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco’s in Spain, Salazar’s in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some had probably believed that it was sufficient to exercise the right to vote in the most direct way possible to see democracy victorious over its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a characteristic of the state of mind.
The universal suffrage, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and may just as well become an instrument of oppression, as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of the powers, an education, enlightenment, economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is also a political and democratic crisis, first and foremost.
The change of attitude of the Greek true-false referendum would have been doubly revealing in this respect: firstly, that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also, on the other hand, that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inconvenience.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by pushing for the success of the domestic referendum, organised according to needs and in the wrong order.
A free pass for the European sole ruler or a blindfolded leap into the emptiness of nationalist retreat: A great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, out of full justice, clarified and steady, an election and democracy, this time on a European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - by the way, you no longer know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it prevails in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bows to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at the international level.
One is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - and it is the whole of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus each and every one of the nations attached to it.
The urgency is to return the leadership of the European project to the hands of people's sovereignty.
It is up to the Europeans as a whole whether they can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and create a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis is a condition for decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without certainly leading us to ruin.
This proposal has long been opposed by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, and today everyone is pushing for it.
Agreed.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy, as envisaged by the citizens, would be another folly and another dead end.
We need to take on a new stage in European construction.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not suffice here.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to build a better integrated Europe at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" smart cards become commonplace
The world trade fair for smart cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is contactless technology, which enables payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless smart cards were to be sold worldwide this year!
Its market share is expected to grow further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment, having been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were distributed.
However, consumer markets are steaming up.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCards this year.
In order to move at a higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
“Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing over to their customers contactless chip-equipped bank cards in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only the first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
To date, a vanishingly small percentage of devices are equipped with the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology required to carry out these transactions.
"They are in default".
"But they should experience a real upward trend at least next year."
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Société Générale also announced yesterday that it was preparing to launch an offer that would allow its customers to make contactless payments via mobile phone.
Terrorist front understands, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect of Boko Haram.
The long suspected relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself had confirmed that Algiers had now "acknowledged".
“The way in which both organizations are acting, as well as the relations of the intelligence services, indicate a clear cooperation,” he said without going into further detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January has revealed interfaces.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped by Aqmi supporters at a restaurant in Niamey, are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators say they found several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble at the scene.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the phone calls led to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had spent a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
“This is progress, but there is no doubt that we need to wait for clearer evidence before we can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem.”
“But it is conceivable.”
"It has been known for years that the sect is receiving financial and intellectual support from outsiders and that this is increasingly active," says the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become increasingly apparent in their course, as have the speeches and operation modes of Boko Harem, which now point to the attraction of suicide bombers as well as the use of increasingly complex explosives, which bear the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to start with Washington, has been putting pressure on Abuja ever since to address the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed long considered the group to be a community of Illuminati, which does not need to be given any special attention.
Fast success
Founded in Maiduguri in 2002 in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - meaning "Western education is a disgrace" in Haoussa - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this impoverished region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict adherence to Sharia law, while its affiliated activists fight against the godless central government.
The activists initially targeted churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram were particularly active with their increased attacks against the Commissariats.
However, the reaction from Abuja is, as usual, indifferent.
The army encircles the city, counting 800 dead.
The captured Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes increasingly radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an assassination attempt in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide bombing that took place at the secure police headquarters in Abuja – the first of its kind.
In August, the UN’s local headquarters will become a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which will lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has since alarmed all security experts.
While the Aqmi have occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Harem and said he was ready to "report all the evidence".
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival each other in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq, and Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, if not simple, ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidate, voters could almost get that impression.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their fellow campaigners have repeated their thunderous statements as well as their statements regarding foreign policy, a traditional Republican focus.
Over China, Iran and Israel aid fall - often in no way substantiated - slogans.
Mitt Romney, who is most in favour of appointing the "Grand Old Party", threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and accuse them of "currency manipulation" - the leading issue in an America that is extremely irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
“It’s a stupid move if it’s meant to trigger a trade war,” he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost breathed a sigh of relief over his emotion-flattering behavior.
He had called for a tangible but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman is not being heard, as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also vowed military strikes against Iran in case the sanctions to stop the nuclear program fail.
“If I get elected, I will stop Iran,” he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll get the bomb".
He also promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of being guilty of obligations to this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second-highest placed candidate, for his part, displays a shameful lack of knowledge of the file.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat as Beijing "attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to take into account the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, said he was prepared to engage the U.S. Army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidacy of Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an outside political heavyweight.
To the current presidential opponents, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was also an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, as far as the topic of anti-terror was concerned.
They rightly insist on the failure of his na<0xC3><0xAF>ve dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his “boys” from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite so casual.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive record of national security under Obama, which bin Laden has eliminated.
Since Iraq, she has been wary of military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama is more appropriately surprised by arguing that America must be economically rebuilt to revitalize its leadership.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly to Russia, has been put into operation.
It will supply gas to the equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with glitz and glory.
Over 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas transmission line, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level, last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under orchestra sound and at gourmet buffet.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have symbolically turned the steering wheel of the valve that transports Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas transmission line, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year are to be delivered to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1,224 km in length connecting the Saint Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas – the equivalent of the French total consumption – is to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you can already hear the eventuality of the construction of a third line on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building seems like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: they are now finding it more difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to shut down access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most heavily engaged in the debate, was not afraid to compare the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" linked to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained an even higher level of security of supply by advocating this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of a decarbonisation of European energy, as the project has broken a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to implement its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have high gas consumption and whose gas reserves are running out.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the large gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All this explains the broad smile of the numerous Gazprom managers in Lubmin regarding the gas supply.
The construction of this gas transmission line is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipe is made of steel with a concrete jacket, which is supposed to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at a depth of about 200 m.
During its construction, minefields dating from the Second World War had to be avoided.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long line of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted by anything over its entire length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers refrained from doing so, as the Swedes had little desire to see a Russian state company settle permanently at the level of their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas passage in less than a minute," Jens Müller said.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas transmission line thus escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers as little likely, since the weld seams were estimated to have a resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot controlled for external observation purposes from a seagoing vessel and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, with a diameter of one meter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and moved by the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on its arrival about any deformations of the metal.
The gas transmission line has been designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entry point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to realize this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated here (both 15.5%), as are the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (both 9%).
These five companies have formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas transmission line.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company the entire capacity of its gas transport, namely on a renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real amount of gas transported is," said Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% by shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the total investment was 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are determined to recoup their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea on a sandy, pine-covered stretch of coast near Lubmin.
The 4.5 metre high valves form the gas outlet gates.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other parameters of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal will be supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per passing hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Launched by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent by candlelight with writing.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognisable again, with its black rectangular cover, elastic band, eggshell pages, as if aged over time.
The Moleskine notebook, as it is known today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, the company’s specialist consultant at the time, is tasked with launching the new product on the market.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique called mole skin, which refers to a cotton bag used, for example, for upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was in high demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine revived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success is coming.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established themselves with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom picture of the buyers, as the notebook inspires businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded clients.
The small Italian company, which in its early days had 12 employees, now employs more than 100 people and has had two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centers and knows how to assert its identity.
“We have followed the spirit of the times and its new writing needs, which exist despite the upsurge of emails,” said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine company: recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (detour) " in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a leopard print cover on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural zeitgeist and knew how to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer cases... The brand has the full range of articles.
In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for the disabled".
Despite a purposeful public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is always twice the average: 19% against 9% of the total population.
Disheartening?
"No," emphasizes <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which organizes the "week of work for the disabled."
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still an enormous amount of work to be done."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for disabled unemployed people before they get a job.
The elderly are more often affected: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a high school diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled students among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for disabled people, compared with 38% for the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter work and that form the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
The unspoken remains the unspoken, the attitudes which, while certain, are slowly developing.
A study conducted in April by the Association IMS-Entreprendre for the journal La Cité stated that the managers surveyed had “a weak level of knowledge regarding the disabled” that was “overrepresented by persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disadvantaged”.
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was laid down in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, dating from 2008, point to a 2.6% ratio.
“We are now at around 3%,” said Pierre Blanc, director general of Agefiph, the organization tasked with collecting contributions from companies that violate this law.
The proof is that the number of "fees paid" permanent establishments, as well as the sum of the sums paid in between 2007 and 2011, decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 (from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, created strong pressure on the companies," said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the workplaces between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not hidden the pleasure that the friendly brought them, even before they faced the Blue Tuesday evenings (8:45 p.m.).
It would be too far-fetched to say that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could well have made peace.
Five months after the spirited gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had earned nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is a Belgian".
"I want to look forward," assures the native Liller, for his part.
As for the contrast between his representation in the club and the national team, "It is a unity that justifies everything."
"In Lille I am all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to get started".
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought on Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France, to finally "shine".
However, without neglecting the note of "pleasure".
He has been supporting the French national team since the age of 7, leading his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
“I was always supported,” he confirmed.
This inevitably helps to reinforce even more the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
"We just walked across the road".
"To play against them means great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, sounded "proud" with good-naturedness.
"The Pride of Performing a Galamatch".
"Proud" also to confirm - in his capacity as "neighbors" - that France "has again become a team at a very high level", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician sees very well the plane with the Blue (the French national team) share ... and namely towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians are coming out big," he stressed.
“We’re in the process of planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You will notice this in the upcoming games". The match against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward with great optimism to the return match against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg, both teams lacked objectivity.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selec<0xC3><0xA7>ao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this means in fact only 90 minutes of bliss.
But there is a match to play, and an opponent to dispose of, and that is Bosnia.
Considering the first leg (0-0) on Friday in Zenica’s hell, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to give the matter that important stamp that would have taken the pressure off it.
"This is a good result, but it carries some risk because we didn't score an away goal."
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they can win in front of an audience that might as well be hot on the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very close", said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but we are fully convinced that we will be able to win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being part of the 2012 European Championship," said Carlos Queiroz.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw can already be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
“This is a good result, but it carries some risk because we didn’t score an away goal,” Bento said.
"We will be competing against a team that has high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese planned to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning, in order to "give them no time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is put into practice this time.
