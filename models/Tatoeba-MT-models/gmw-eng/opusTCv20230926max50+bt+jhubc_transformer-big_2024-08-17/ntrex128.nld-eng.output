Members of the National Assembly of Wales concerned that they ‘will be compared to Muppets’
There is a stir among the members of the National Assembly of Wales by a proposal that their title be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name appears ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party’s National Assembly in Wales said that MWP ‘reverses on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the Plaid party’s National Assembly in Wales said the group as a whole is “dissatisfied” and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was “open” to the name change, but noted that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short u.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently drafting legislation to implement the name change, said: “It is, of course, the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who are taking the final decision on their new title.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave members of the National Assembly of Wales the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
At present, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have a difficult time reaching a consensus and she will have to submit a bill on the changes in a few weeks' time.
The legislation on reforms also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly operates, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote definitively on their new title when they debate the legislation.
Residents of Macedonia vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia.”
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve an ongoing dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to applications from Macedonia to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said that he will not take into account the result of the referendum.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue, however, that the name change is simply the price that must be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's silence, those of Harlem are having a hard time
“The older people I spoke to said that there used to be a cafe and a church here on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
Today there is neither a café nor a church.”
He said it's understandable that cafes are gone.
“People now have social contact in a different way,” he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the district, where people visit regularly.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of the churches’ assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will go back to the beginning.”
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that won’t help in the remaining refuges of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will lead to these churches being closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will join the church community.”
Both churches were once built by a white church congregation, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolitan community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original congregation of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church from the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers on 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939, the building was seriously damaged by fire, but when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild the church, they also bought a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor at Saint Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July referred to the instrument in a different way: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first carillon in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's had not replaced him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin’s are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the lay leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote to the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese would want to “pass on the expense” to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese had sent.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old who dived to lobsters in California
On Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California. The boy sustained injuries, it says.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help. Along with some others, he paddled towards the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was crying because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized “that the boy was crying, ‘I’ve been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
His clavicle was completely open,” Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
“I yelled out, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is said to be in mortal danger.
It is not known which shark species was responsible for the attack.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks before, but that it had then been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
The authorities closed off access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break through in the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, establishing beauty departments where specialist assistants work, such as in department stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the UK beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as sales of fashion and household items continue to decline. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country. If they turn out to be a success, they will be launched in even more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of supermarkets wanting to fill the shelves where TVs, microwaves and interior items once stood with other products.
Sainsbury’s aims to double its beauty offering and offer 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space, with exhibition space per brand, such as in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique make-up, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop will be testing concessions in two of Sainsbury’s’ stores. The first one is previously opened in Croydon, in south London, the second one will open later this year in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and increasingly buy small amounts of food at local supermarkets on a daily basis, supermarkets need to put more effort into convincing people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury’s, says the stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain takes on discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos outlets into hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were acquired two years ago. According to the company, food sales have increased as a result and the acquisitions have provided greater returns.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its Beauty and Pharmacy departments a makeover, it became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was terminated when a conflict arose over the distribution of revenue from the pharmacy department in supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury’s sold its 281 pharmacy departments in stores three years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have completely changed the decor of our beauty department to make it more enjoyable for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop the old way.'
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is "angry" because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn’t have time for Truly, their homewear and accessories brand.
Jones and Willoughby’s company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is furious at Holly Willoughby for pulling out of her profitable lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “enraged” when Willoughby announced Tuesday at a difficult meeting at the company’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts (worth as much as <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million) would leave her insufficient time for Truly, their homewear and accessories brand.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby’s <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left for one of his vacation rentals abroad.
A source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would ensure its long-term future, and provide enough for decades to come.
Everyone was stunned when she decided to retire.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse of the headquarters in Marlow is full of products that are ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now be subject to further delays.
And that could be the end of a long-lasting friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 along with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two couples often go on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will soon be M&S’ brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m A Celebrity on ITV.
A source from Jones’s entourage said last night: “We have no comment on his business matters.”
Hard language ‘and then there was love between us’
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for a comment he made that some people would find “inappropriate for a president,” and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a big step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
Negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “corresponding response” by the United States after North Korea’s first disarmament initiatives.
The United States, meanwhile, is continuing its sanctions to keep the pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
“We are doing very well in North Korea,” he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have led to positive results. The missile trials have ended, hostages have been freed and the remains of American soldiers have returned to their home countries.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok no longer had a home, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for launching international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, it is clear that they are not requesting international aid, which is difficult for us,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain whether the aid workers from abroad can work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be given permission to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
Shelters were built in Aceh to shelter from tsunamis, but along other coasts you rarely see them.
That there was no warning siren for tsunamis in Palu, even though a warning was in force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Even in ideal conditions, it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia’s ragged infrastructure was one of the focal points of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign, and he has already spent a great deal of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko’s government is facing a shortage of funding, while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also being pressured by ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority are now following a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets, using machetes, bow and arrow and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes impressive equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool last Saturday from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was at a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team was 1-0 behind.
He tapped left against the ball and then kicked in the direction of the furthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, towards the top right corner of the net.
He avoided the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante approaching and made an attempt. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked the ball.'
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead at the break, after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed through midfield to Liverpool's playing half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in midfield.
He then gave a nice pass, allowing Hazard to reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defence and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the rear post.
Liverpool play Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the group stage of the Champions League against Napoli, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster relief agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that had collapsed as a result of last Friday’s 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which also produced waves 6 m high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman is stabbed to death
This morning, the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at Grayson Mews on John Street at 7.55 a.m. The body showed stab wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police ask the locals to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation has only just begun, but I would like to ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if they may have filmed something via a dashcam because they can have information that is essential to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon friends who think they know the woman came to the place to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A police officer would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She kept saying, “How bad!”
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the fence and a third was just outside.
Within the deposition, a number of agents were monitoring the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, stating log 247 of September 30.
Cromwell statue to UK Parliament is latest victim of 'rewriting history' riot
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate over the removal of statues would lead to the sighting of Oliver Cromwell’s figure just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The magnificent image of Cromwell, created by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe must be recognized today.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct representation, that is still debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognisable figure representing one side of that divide.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector must also be recognized and commemorated.”
Murderous Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, whose only surname is known as Yuan, was found dead at a stall in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province. His artery was punctured and he was covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inoculate pigs at a pigsty, on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He is said to have travelled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring pigsty open.
According to the cousin, there was a large male pig with blood on its beak in the pigsty.
A forensic examination showed that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and mutilated,” the cousin with the surname “Wu” said, according to the Guiyang Evening News newspaper.
Surveillance cameras showed Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not from Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police gathered evidence on the spot.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
It rarely happens, but there have been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife chased the animal away.
When an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer testified to CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
“They’re just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they're not out to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect,” he said.
The Tail of Hurricane Rosa Brings Heavy Rain to the Southwest
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it reaches the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest in the coming days.
With a wind speed of 135 km/h, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. local time on Sunday morning, and was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula like a tropical storm on Monday, tropical humidity is pushed northwards, to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, debris flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will cause precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rain is expected to fall as much as 5 to 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as the tropical rains can be very widespread.
It is strongly discouraged to go into the desert on foot when the tropical rains threaten.
The heavy rainfall can turn ravines into raging rivers, and thunderstorms will produce local gusts of wind and dust.
The approaching trough brings local some heavy rain to parts of Southern California’s coastline.
Rain of 1.5 cm is possible, which could lead to small debris flows and slippery roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rains will approach Arizona Sunday night until Monday morning, after which the rain will become more widespread Monday end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue to fall through Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the US can fluctuate sharply, as the Arctic becomes cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a fine example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the continuing summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern U.S., October is expected to start warm, with temperatures fluctuating around 30°C everywhere, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York it can be 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that there is a high chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States until mid-October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the harrowing testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of allegedly assaulting a woman in the 1980s, on one of the six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, while broadcasters interrupted regular programming for Friday’s surprise: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh was groping her and trying to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a spirited testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
Probably more than the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen watched on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for the other networks broadcasting the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look in an office.
For comparison, it’s like playing a football game or winning an Oscar.
Fox News Channel, which supports Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the audience remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his vote, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning that protesters were shouting at him as he tried to take the elevator to a hearing by the Justice Commission.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes down while being taunted, live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
Someone shouted, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various broadcasters broadcast everything live when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favor with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee by next week, something the minority Democrats insist.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake’s choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of “a political game” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s levies was “absurd.”
Wayde Sims shooting: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect in LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot dead.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison on suspicion of manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
Police questioned Simpson and later stated that he had confessed to shooting Wayde resulting in his death.
His bail has been set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The parish coroner in East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The report notes that the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police, and local residents have all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked local police for his “dedication and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “broken” and “in shock” by Wayde’s death.
“This is an event that you always hope will never happen,” Wade says.
Volcano spews as on Mexico City
The ash ejected by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater had been picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ash had been recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center detected rumble and vibrations several times.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ash appeared on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, for the first time since September 2017, when a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico.
The volcano, which is called ‘Don Goyo’, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists clashed with riot police, while thousands took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia that split the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists stopped by riot police pelted the agents with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, clashes broke out with the police, and the officers pulled out their baton to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups chanted, “Don’t forget, don’t forgive,” as their opponents chanted, “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions continue to mount in the independence-minded region, one year after the October 1 referendum, considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters spoke out overwhelmingly to become independent, although turnout was low and people opposed to secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region, resulting in violent skirmishes.
Pro-independence groups had camped on the spot the night of Friday to avoid a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia’s prospects for independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties achieved an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even if it was close, it was difficult for them to build on their success this year, as many of their best-known leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in captivity awaiting trial over their role in organizing the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The tensions are increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, said he will participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“A candidacy for the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after house was rammed with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
At some point, a crossbow may have been fired at the car.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the win
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and handed Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 games since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and the team of Gary Holt was on the same level with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed to win an away game in the Premiership this season, facing leader Hearts on Sunday, who is eight points ahead of them.
But first, the Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston remains undefeated, with the team already winning six consecutive games in his division, and coach Holt hasn't suffered a single defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
Holt’s team could have achieved a head start long before the first goal, as their direct way of playing caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish with a goal, then Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halkett's header, kicked the ball over the goal.
The home team let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited his chances quietly and confidently.
And that ultimately led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free kick and Livingston made an opening, while Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create an opportunity for Menga, who scored from the penalty area.
At that point, the Rangers had possession of the ball for a long time, but the defense of the home team was adamant and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not yet had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made Kelly avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball against Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a pass from his colleagues at Livingston.
Livingston's forwards continued to reach the penalty area, but were denied each time. A penalty was refused twice, one after Halkett's attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Phenomenal' by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal achievement and result for Livingston.
They played excellently without exception and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and squad composition has barely changed since their return to the highest regions, but Holt in particular deserves a lot of recognition for the way he has propelled the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on top of their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, failed to break through.
Although they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they only managed to knock out the home team once) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better because they are somewhere in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan is welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a bright blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went together for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (29 September).
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan left for Cologne for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police called for security reasons when they prevented the crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers came close to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The rival protests reflect the divisiveness of a visitor who is hailed by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in a runaway accident on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were busy identifying the man and will notify his immediate family.
The road is closed in several places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Wounded in Disturbance
Six guards have been injured in a disturbance in a heavily secured prison for men, according to the prison bureau.
The riots broke out Sunday at about 9.30am local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialized Tornado guards have been deployed to solve a situation involving eight prisoners in one ward.
The guards were treated there for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible will at least be referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars longer.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had been treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to jail for a serious disorder involving staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (with potentially positive consequences for drought areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa is moving over the southwest of the desert area, which carries risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden flooding Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday, and it's already going to rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status in the 200-mile area of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest desert region, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there 10 cm is possible.
For the areas that are not at risk of flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrisome, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map that identifies current drought areas, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category.
The route of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland via the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km/h, located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, weakening it.
Therefore, she is expected to arrive in Mexico Monday afternoon or evening with the force of a tropical storm.
Heavy rains can fall in parts of Mexico, posing a significant risk of flooding.
“Results of a total of 8 to 15 cm are expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,” weather.com reported.
Rosa moves north across Mexico like a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The biggest danger expected from Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and southwest of the desert area,” the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured Saturday at about 4 a.m. local time in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is ‘stable’.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
Police are asking anyone who may have filmed something of what happened to get in touch.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘has suffered from the vileness, the anger’ of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “has suffered constantly under the viciousness, the anger” of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing about her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the “American people saw the magnificent and incredible character, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to recognize one of the most accomplished legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent track record,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
I don’t participate, but I actually do participate,” he said.
“That’s why I stand up for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to “resist and hinder us.”
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and toll rising
A major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi killed at least 384 people, wiping many off the ground as giant waves crashed onto the beach, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of up to six meters high hit land at the moment it started to dusk. Many people crashed and the waves destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach, they didn’t immediately walk away and became the victims of the tsunami,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian agency for aid to natural disasters BNPB said during a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami also led to other dangers: it dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the Agency for Natural Disaster Assistance show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been twisted and collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times the force of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has further increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the dead were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said. About 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala “is completely flat, we have no information at all,” Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,’ the Red Cross said in a statement. The Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” the Red Cross said.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday for not saying a tsunami had hit Palu, although staff said the waves had reached the country within the time the warning had been given.
In amateur footage shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building screaming in panic at people on the street below to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water collapses on the coast and buildings and cars are dragged along.
Reuters could not immediately verify the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military is currently sending cargo planes carrying relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees are still in urgent need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll rises above 800.
It's really bad.
Although World Vision employees from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their office seek shelter in tents of tarpaulin, they passed scenes of devastation along the way, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses that had been destroyed,” he said.
It's really bad.
Even when aid groups began the difficult task of getting emergency relief started, some complained that certain foreign aid workers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, goods and personnel from abroad can only be allowed if the location of a disaster is declared a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.”
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu, friends and relatives of the missing continued to hope that they would find their loved ones’ lives again, as in the miracles that people so much like to hear in terrible natural disasters like this.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, aid workers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place in Indonesia earlier this month.
His students were also detained at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread in the paragliding community and that in the hours that followed he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival there.
In his messages, however, only one grey checkmark appeared instead of two blue checkmarks.
“I think that means the messages haven’t been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during cash machine supply at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had just emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While he was busy, another man ran from behind Brink’s employee and stole a bag of money that was ready to be delivered.
Witnesses saw multiple suspects flee, the press release said, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the perpetrators is requested to contact the Newport Police Department on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: “The being formally known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change was announced ahead of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her performance during the show for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator says.
Ye is not only an abbreviation of his current stage name, but West has already told us that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think “ye” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you,” West said earlier this year, when he told radio host Big Boy about the title of his album.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
I’ve switched from Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He's not the only famous rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to work with West, has already worked with and without the hyphen and capital letters.
Mexican president vows not to use military forces against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military force against civilians. The country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use military force to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing as many as 300 people, during which time leftist student movements emerged across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often join criminal gangs due to unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
U.S. should double funding of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount it spends on research from A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all of Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this following the announcements about A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for A.I..
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: the country wants to be the number one in terms of A.I. innovations by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for A.I. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we’re looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.,” Lee said.
A doubling of funding could lead to a doubling of the chance that the next great achievement for A.I. will take place in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading A.I. companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an A.I. system that defeated American Othello's best player, and later was a manager at Microsoft Research and President of Google's Chinese division.
Lee expressed appreciation for technology contests organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next contest would take place, as it would help to discover the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
“China is not picking on our best academics, the companies are doing it,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited the best forces from universities to work on A.I.
Lee said U.S. efforts on A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“Those who do a PhD in A.I. should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences is providing financial support to employees of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are giving money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, intended to involve industry and academia partners in the initiative, and announced the White House’s formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, U.S. legislation that should lead to the creation of a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been in a slump for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible name change of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a dispute with Greece that has been dragging on for decades and would no longer hinder Greece's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province which is also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbor means that the country claims Greek territory. Consequently, Greece vetoed the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists believe the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum and by a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required turnout of at least 50 percent will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot is formulated as follows: “Do you support NATO and the EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
‘Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to join bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia fell apart.
“I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgiyevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Election Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout at the time was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters came to vote.
“I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018, during the referendum on the name change of the country that would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents that had been placed by people who boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, and not through a backdoor,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says membership of NATO will provide much-needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I am convinced that the vast majority is in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that a ‘yes’ as a result would be ‘an affirmation of our future’.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defence of Brighton and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton in defence at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, and Manchester City won the match 2-0.
It seemed like a piece of cake, as Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian striker first received the ball in midfield.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
There, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He managed to pass a defender and was also too fast for some others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling waited.
The English forward used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We decided to let him play for 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in the Brighton playing field.
He sent a beautiful stab pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a while and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player tapped the ball into the net just before it was too far.
City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. The match will take place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play along and not make it easy for the Rockies to reach the playoff
With the Washington Nationals eliminated for the playoffs, there wasn’t much reason to force a fresh start.
However, the ever competitive Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are consequences for the participation of the Rockies in the playoff. They are currently one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have won at least a wildcard for the playoff thanks to their 5-2 win against the Nationals last Friday, but still want to make every effort to secure their first division title.
“While there’s nothing left for us, at least we can pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level I’d come across this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play in it?”
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to pitch Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, stood Thursday in the throw-in field and would pitch next Sunday, although that is normally his rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher stands at 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to hold meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court candidate, while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections. I'm not taking part, but actually I'm taking part. That's why I stand up for great candidates everywhere," he said.
“We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take back power, no matter what they have to do to do it, you see the meanness, the ugliness.
It doesn’t matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control, that’s what they want: power and control, but we won’t give them that.”
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “resist and hinder us.”
“And we’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil and mean and false and lying.”
He named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, leading to loud public outcry.
“Do you remember what she answered?
Have you leaked the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting one... that was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a large church.
The party is intolerant of people who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour MPs to get that we are not welcome just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion for censorship punished me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, on the importance of responsible economic policies, on national security, on Europe, similar issues like this one where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was stated: “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
And that was the case with most of the GC meetings on Friday evening during the eight years that I was already a local Labour Member of Parliament.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of a “kinder, softer” politics has long been forgotten, if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a dissenting opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the Party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader. Colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a similar political outlook to me, suddenly expected me to make a turnaround and take a position that I would otherwise never have agreed to, from topics such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak in front of an audience, whatever I say, there are mockeries on social media calling for the rejection of my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next election, exposing the politics of the Centre and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who deal with a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that serious abuses are apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every ‘motivation of mistrust’ or change of selection rules, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
I have been advised many times over the past two years to keep my head down, not just to express my opinion out loud, and then I would ‘not get into trouble’.
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since I joined Labour as a schoolchild 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that literally collapsed my classroom, I have always advocated better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a city councillor and in my role as minister.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity on my policy positions and my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country drags on to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next election or political opportunities will not stop me from acting according to what I believe is in your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr on the way to the top
Two late try's may have slightly skewed the end result, but there's no doubt that Ayr justly triumphs in this delightful match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the standings, the only undefeated team in the ten.
In the end, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that gave the home team the win, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
“We’ve had a hard time in our games so far and we’re still undefeated, so I’m a happy man,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie: ‘All the credit to Ayr, they have taken better advantage of their chances than we have.’
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but a yellow card from Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he got during the Warriors game) allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot managed to break off a try.
Climo provided an extra advantage for Ayr with a penalty and scored a conversion after a solotry just before the break. So it was 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson’s try, followed by a conversion from Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was long paused for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was drained on a stretcher, and as soon as the match was restarted, Ayr was able to continue by a try from Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion from Climo.
Then Ayr captain Blair Macpherson got a yellow card, and again Melrose dealt the extra man when no conversion followed a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a match where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he tackled Climo without the ball, MacPherson behind the advancing Ayr mouth caused a touchdown on the penalty line-out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did so again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent halfback Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth try.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Ford Kieran from Still Game is going into the hospitality industry. Apparently he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself acts together with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it looks like Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in Glasgow’s ‘blooming restaurant business’.
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen path to Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a rigged naval office in La Paz.
An ocean blue flag is flying on public buildings.
On all naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It’s a duty to win them back.”
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country has lost to Chile after a bloody nineteenth-century commodity conflict is still vivid, as is the desire to re-enter the Pacific.
That hope may well have reached its highest point in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice, which is due to fall on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the result with a positive outlook,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the Court’s ruling on big screens, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will argue in favor of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of tough talks, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, much is at stake with Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia, and even if it did, little would change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the closing arguments indicates that the case was “not complicated,” says Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome for Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the situation may have gotten worse in the last four years.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has completely undermined all good will that Chile may have yet to have, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to continue talking afterwards.
The two countries have not had an ambassador to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court’s decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of international relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, uses the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart stalled nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “utopia” that the enduring sanctions and the U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will one day bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking important steps in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and it is doubted that Pyongyang is serious when he says he would forgo an arsenal that the country probably sees as his only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge headwear, soon for sale near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of crazy oversized headwear for their SS19 collection on the runway, a standout move during Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were indistinguishable from Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their dazzling creations on the catwalk.
The striking piece by Valentino was a giant beige hat decorated with a feathery wide edge, hanging over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons set with gems, a wizard’s hat and even a pineapple, but those weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn shut and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like diving gear, complete with snorkels and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you’re in luck.
Style watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-meter wide brim that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that popped up everywhere on social media also created another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost the size of the swimsuit model that carried the bag.
The red-orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather handle, was the most striking piece in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Famed stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer. Given the designer’s huge impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for extra-large accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have an excellent track record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with yet another set of excellent exam results, and moreover individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives across the community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects par excellence within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students studying foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools affiliated with SCIS, shows that 72 percent of the students achieved a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the students achieved German, 69 percent of the students French and 63 percent of the students Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as subject choice as much as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that of the obstacles to filling vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, in the future he will have a real advantage with such a skill for life.
Communicating directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an edge over the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language that exceeded 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today’s children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
It cannot be denied that languages remain vital for the future of the country in a global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered ‘international communication skills.’
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron makes his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting for LeBron James’ first game at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening game before the season.
It remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six games prior to the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump's election rally period in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump Begins Tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a Long Series of Election Rallyes
It is Trump’s first of five scheduled rallies in the coming week, including stops in places he’s fond of, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he chooses for the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been put on hold, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when a vote is taken in November.
What time does Trump’s rally in West Virginia start tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, kicks off tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online via the livestream on YouTube.
Trump will likely talk about this week’s hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have been extra-charged as Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment as the FBI investigates the case.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans running for the November election get more momentum.
President Trump’s campaign leadership said these five rallies over the next week are intended to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“Congress control is so important to his program that the president is traveling to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season begins,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep hope alive in the run-up to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes were perhaps just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating swing of opportunities is a completely invented sports concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially at competitions like this one.
So who currently has the best chances?
“They had a six-point lead at first, and now that’s only four more, so we kind of think happiness is on our side right now,” Spieth said before leaving at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of being four points ahead, while there are still twelve in the game.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been a fearsome opponent from tee to green and he sets a good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when playing well became louder as his lap progressed and he accomplished a crucial putt that made match four a success when he and Thomas were two points behind after two games.
His putt with which they won the match at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can deduce that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
“You have to dig deep and only worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players can do now.
18 holes to make your mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but delicious European duo has four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Moliwood' was the only duo that played no bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to score a European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson cut short Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of the morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backlog for the Spaniard and the Swede they could not overcome.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you catch up.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and the way a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
The European team has played the best so far and has a nice lead in the run-up to the final day, but this foursome session has also shown Team USA is willing to take on the fight, something some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe takes the lead 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes on Saturday, they are 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two wins more than Tiger Woods, who was struggling, giving them a four-point lead at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, which wants the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. faced more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but was unable to catch up with its backlog.
Jim Furyk's team must score eight points during Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood, is only the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening games after a sensational weekend.
After hitting Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully matched and beat a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally showed a brilliant move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three in the world, with 2&1.
Nevertheless, it was not easy for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with three points on Saturday.
They won after a difficult game with the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch up with a four-point deficit at the beginning of the singles, although Furyk's team has had enough of a draw as they currently hold the trophy.
But now that they have been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says it will ‘under no circumstances’ unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are leading to increasing distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances, the country could in no case unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the site for nuclear testing, and promising not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see a similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will in no case unilaterally disarm.”
Although Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it takes further steps, he noted that he did not disapprove of unilateral denuclearization a priori, as Pyongyang used to do.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the very first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions only increase our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the US leader suggested earlier in the week at the United Nations.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the other party to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock.”
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles would be aimed at the U.S. mainland after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there is still much to be done and that sanctions should continue until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this: “Whether it’s two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of the U.N. Security Council sanctions must be vigorously and firmly pursued until we have achieved complete, definitive, verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to greatly reduce funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Just hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, North Korea accused him of making “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea promised this month during a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night long while drinking plenty of caffeine.
One professor noted that students at the world’s largest university often have no idea of the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, drew up the course. As far as he knows, it is unique in the US.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a speech about the influence of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of my speech, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only getting to hear this now, in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being organized for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was determined that students had a severe sleep deficit during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections, the students see an image of a dormitory, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise devices and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine at bedtime.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Using a campus map, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
‘We know that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we feel they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know what consequences the choice of cigarettes has on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of one-night studying still exists, he says, and due to modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep deprivation is an ever-increasing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep, of good quality, should be the student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain because sleep deprivation causes the brain to give them a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the course, having attended the professor’s class last year when he was in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar program of study before coming to the competitive setting.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, and not just an alarm to get up. They should also be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” of electronics screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, causing you to have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal kills Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their away game again disappointing when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team defeated 1-0 at Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first win at an away game since they defeated St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but the team of Gary Holt caused the loss, barely the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 games. His team is now eight points behind Hearts, which continue to the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers failed to score the tie.
The Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could face even more problems, as border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after apparently an object was thrown at him by the supporters of the visitors' team.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, passing Ayr and going to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt remained with the same team for Livingston, who managed to win a point last week, and would have been delighted at the way his well-trained team had managed to block the opponents at every move.
The Rangers may have had the most possession, but Livingston did more with it.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga dropped the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had Allan McGregor's goal in the sights, but the midfielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked the rear pole.
The Rangers did manage to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than really believe if they could approach the target.
Alfredo Morelos felt he was entitled to a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless clashed after 15 minutes of play, but referee Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's request.
The Rangers could only shoot twice to the goal in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who used to be a goalkeeper at the Ibrox, could easily stop Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Livingston’s opener in the 34th minute may not be in line with the general course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it, if only for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs’ deep playing pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool-blooded and chose Menga, who kicked the ball into goal with ease.
Gerrard interrupted Coulibaly/Ryan Kent's move, which had almost immediate consequences when winger Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play the kind of game Livingston prefers to play, with Lithgow and Halkett continuing to kick long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final phase of the game, but McGregor held up well and blocked Jacobs off, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton called for a penalty kick at the end of the game after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the almanac of our ‘Sunday Morning': September 30, 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for those who can TELL well... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been an indispensable part of science, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film with the at first sight unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘What the hell is that?’
Rogers: ‘This is a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: ‘It’s really popping now!’
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to ‘see’ and kill malignant cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them in a lab
They can then ‘see’ a protein that is common in many types of cancer and then be re-injected
A test vaccine gives promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer go away for more than 18 months
In the method, immune cells are removed in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted in such a way that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which is often found in all types of cancer.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of several types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and “learn” these cells to address cancer cells has been shown to work earlier in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West stands out as a pro-Trump tirade and wears MAGA cap after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
It didn’t go as he had hoped.
Kanye West was booed during a broadcast of Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he will run for president in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a cap on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he pitched a rant against the Democrats and reiterated that he supports Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white man, he asks, ‘How can you have sympathy for Trump? He’s a racist!’
“If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon got in the way of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with the alleged sexual assault that Christine Blasey Ford accuses him of.
West's rant was not broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded it on social media.
It's not clear if Rock wants to make fun of West with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been fired backstage for his cap.
“They beat me backstage.
They said, "Don't step on the stage with that cap."
They teased me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see how apathetic looks?’ He said he would put on her superman cape, ‘because that means you can’t order me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
According to Variety, the crowd shouted boos at least twice, and the SNL cast members seemed embarrassed. The magazine was told by an attendee: ‘The whole studio was suddenly quiet.'
West was the last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of our bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR DEFENDING THE MASSA.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was “just himself, and that’s beautiful.”
“But I choose not to reward someone who supports and spits out an ideology that harms my community (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We too,” she added.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, he is, “the creature formally known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Former rapper Snoop Dogg has also borne the name Snoop Lion, and the late music legend Prince once changed his name to a symbol and then into The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed Friday in a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Police Court on Monday.
The accusation will be investigated by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington lashes out at toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor lashes out at the macho hero’s stereotype and says young boys often think they have to be tough to get respect when seeing such roles on screen.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something went wrong” and asked how the problem of toxic masculinity should be addressed in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who is recently married to his Game of Thrones co-star, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced the problem needs to be addressed.
“This is really an important question for me personally at the moment: where has our masculinity gone wrong?” he said.
"What did we teach men when they grew up, which is why we are now faced with this problem?"
Kit thinks television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity, due to his very male characters.
He continued: ‘What is innate and what is learned?’
What is being taught on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they have to be a certain kind of man?
I think that’s one of the big questions today: how do we change that?
“Something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones when the series ends next summer, because he is “ready with battlefields and horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard’s True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks his meeting with his wife Rose is the most beautiful episode of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife during the show, so that’s how I kept my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was awarded an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say it has affected more than 820,000 people in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were passed on through sex, which was not the case before.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people contracting HIV in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
According to studies, 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted by inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
The Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication since 2003 as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staffer leaked data from Republican senators and lashes out at 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters goes against the allegations that one of her staffers has posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims the allegations are spread by “far-right” lawmakers and websites.
“Lies, lies, and more mean lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and private phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data came online Thursday and was posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address indicating the source of the posts was linked to Waters’ office and contained the information of a Waters employee, de Hill said.
“This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and a blatant lie,” Waters said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false allegations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and a blatant lie.”
The Waters statement quickly met with criticism online, including by former White House press officer Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“You can tell from this that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not get angry.
He must not become rebellious.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ response to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters’ place in the midterm elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
“Hefty, if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators become known,” she said, “and that they are held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.”
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British twist, we now traditionally look for references to Brexit, and that indeed seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films with a limp spy in the lead role, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back into life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this light-hearted self-satire about how badly we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with bulging eyes and flexible facial features manages in any case to control everything, even with his second comeback. From his name you can deduce that he is a generally comic character that was conceived for moviegoers in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He is, of course, the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a grain of that guy who contributed one note to the theme song of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally based on the traveler and the international mystery man who once played Atkinson in the Barclaycard TV commercials (which everyone has since forgotten) who always leaves a certain chaos behind.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in his medieval armor and tapped the rotor blades against his helmet.
Atkinson can well show in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor rather comes across weakly and strangely enough excessively, especially now that the "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do so well.
The humor seems more intended for children than for adults, and the mad disaster of Johnny English seems to me less original and focused than the jokes without text of the character Bean who plays Atkinson.
The constant theme now is that Britain is in great difficulty.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, revealing the identity of all of Britain’s active secret agents, much to the dismay of the agent in charge, an unfortunately minor role played by Kevin Eldon.
That’s the drop that makes the bucket overflow from the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her utmost with this character reminiscent of Teresa May, but the script doesn’t offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisors, she must deploy a retired spy, since every active spy has been compromised.
And that means the stumbling Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolteacher in a chic setting, but gives unofficial lessons about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the English spy lessons are reminiscent of School of Rock.
English is quickly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pathetic helper, Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of a submarine, a boisterous and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is unfortunately falling for the charms of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their odyssey of raucous fun: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a showy French restaurant, kicking noise aboard Volta’s luxury yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s home.
For the latter, all the registers are pulled open, but no matter how well-intentioned and boisterous the scene is, it is reminiscent of children's television.
It's not all very original.
And as with the other films by Johnny English, I ask myself: can the British film industry really not think of a role that honors Rowan Atkinson’s talent?
Labour denies the party is coming up with a plan where Britons work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party is considering a radical plan whereby Britons work four days a week, but get paid for five days.
Reportedly, the party would like bosses of companies to pass on the savings they make as a result of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to their employees by giving them an extra day of vacation.
This way, employees can enjoy a weekend of three days, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea ‘fits’ into the party’s economic agenda and plans to tilt the country’s balance towards the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Union of Trade Unions, which considers it a good way to ensure that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a goal that fits within the party’s commitment to make the balance in the economy work more for the benefit of the workers and that also fits within the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party already promised a four-day work week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the aim is not yet supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day workweek is not a policy proposal of the party nor is it being considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to make clear his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the “faceless drivers” and the “profiteers” at utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their shares, as a Labour government could apply “discounts” based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees on the boards of directors of companies and to set up inclusive ownership funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) with which 10 percent of the shares of private sector firms are given to the employees who can earn up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy Tell '60 Minutes' Whether the FBI's Investigation of Kavanaugh Could Change Their Opinions
The FBI’s investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least one week and raises the question of whether the FBI’s findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview aired Sunday at 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that could lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said before the hearing that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham’s voice, however, seems to be wall-to-wall.
“My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is solid and the accusation should include dynamite,” he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has vigorously denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see any new developments.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday in New York the Global Citizen Festival is organized, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will perform and which has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to generate awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international advocates who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
Concertgoers who wanted to get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket) had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise meaningfully raising awareness for the goal: ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with 12 more years to go to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an appropriate way to persuade people to demand a call to action or is this just another form of ‘cliktivism’, making people feel they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “actions” from supporters, targeting a wide range of different goals.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have helped world leaders commit to making policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that will change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or brought together through sponsorships.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important declarations of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the UK with the aim of “helping children realise their full potential.” This group has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, from other national governments and from Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice that is malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent asking the UK government to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government has announced it will support a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen website asking “why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The group replied, "It will be a long and difficult road, where sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, just like civil rights and the anti-apartheid movements before us, we will ultimately be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform this year at the event in New York presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy for a 'blockade' to hinder Russian export of energy - Minister of the Interior
Washington may have recourse to the Navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, explained Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that they are only in the Middle East to trade in energy, just as they are in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counteract this.
“The United States has that capability, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke for invitees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that bills itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He went further and compared Washington’s approach to Russia with that of Iran, noting that these are not fundamentally different.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a country that knows only one thing, with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to boost the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe while replacing Russia, a country that by far offers the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw sight from the “unfit” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trum of Berlin said made Moscow’s “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves,” Aleksandr Novak, the Russian energy minister, said after meeting with Rick Perry, the US energy minister, in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industry organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren ‘thinks seriously’ about taking part in 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts senator says
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday that she is “seriously thinking” about participating in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering taking part in the election.
“It is time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means that a woman is in the top position,” she said, according to the political newspaper The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren lashed out at President Donald Trump at the town hall meeting, saying he was “directing this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been candid in her criticisms of Trump and of Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court nominee.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we have to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on this.”
However, an opinion poll published Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own supporters believe she should not run for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run for office, according to an opinion poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent were in favour of her being elected.
The survey showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent ahead of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with a possible participation in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to a report from the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks about Track Palin’s PTSD at Donald Trump’s election rally
Track Palin, 26, has spent a year in Iraq after taking up duty in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence Monday night.
"Because of what my own son is going through, what he is going through now that he's back, I understand other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and the injuries that some of our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience attending a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and they've gotten tougher, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other military have given for the homeland".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and has been charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of an intoxicated weapon, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 States Support Protest Against New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal protest against a new policy in the U.S. denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and Washington D.C. filed a statement Friday as a “friend-of-the-court” in Washington’s court in support of an asylum seeker challenging this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She says her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was then incarcerated in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that Grace supports described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people who apply for asylum in the US, as countries that have major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals, which made it possible for immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington D.C., said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" is stated in the "friend-of-the-court" statement.
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the U.S. hurts the U.S. economy because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and “provide the country with the necessary workforce.”
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
“Asiel is available to those fleeing their country for persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems, even if these problems are serious, which people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as deaths doubled in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation also got worse.
“It feels very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she tried to comfort her feverish baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents returned to their ruined homes and searched their soaked possessions for valuables they could still use.
Hundreds of people have suffered injuries and the hospitals are overpopulated, provided they have not been damaged by the 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the risk of severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he shared his feelings as the devastating earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed against the remains of a wall,” Haris told an Associated Press correspondent, adding he was in town with his family for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, and later I heard nothing more.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of ‘harassment’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper touting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last referred to the China Daily’s paid appendix in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s top-selling newspaper, after he accused China of interfering in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional election, an accusation denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked a new stage in an escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China, according to US officials quoted by Reuters.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed ever-higher import tariffs on each other.
China’s retaliation rates early in the trade war were specifically aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa, who support Trump’s Republican Party, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had affected American workers, farmers and businesses.
“China,” as Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “now doubles the harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, the government of China is taking advantage of freedom of expression and a free press, a long-held tradition in America by placing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at a kiosk in downtown Beijing, you will find voices in vain and you will not see a true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese population may have about the difficult economic trajectory, because the media is firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article,” as he did not say which newspaper this was.
Through the Kavanaugh debacle, Republicans alienated female voters from themselves just before the midterm elections, analysts warn
Now that many major Republicans are rallying around Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and defending him against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts warn that this will set them back, especially among women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this topic have been huge and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to continue with the vote.
“These things can’t be reversed,” Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article that appeared Saturday.
Reeher said he wonders if Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute effort to plead for an FBI investigation will be enough to satisfy angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and they are not going to forget it in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., news outlet.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted “November is coming!” during their demonstration in the hall of the Senate while the Republicans who control the Justice Commission chose to approve Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record high,” Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high, and that’s true.
But it can go even further, especially among floating suburban female voters and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who often don’t vote even if they disagree with the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she further clarified her allegation of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that a backlash could follow if the Republicans pushed through the nomination.
“This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party,” former Republican Party chairman Michael Steele said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote, or the final vote, or Kavanaugh sitting in court, but it’s also about how the Republicans handled this and how they treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats get elected, told the news channel.
The Americans, however, appear to be divided over who they believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority opting out on the side of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s testimony for sure or likely, and 35 percent believe Kavanaugh for sure or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh certainly or probably lied during his testimony while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s move, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals to her at a party during the time they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new Internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project from the technology legend, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that “world domination” is the guiding thought behind Inrupt.
“We have to do this now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own ‘personal online data storage’ or POD.
It can store lists of contacts, activity lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it completely depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea behind Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company provides the resources, processes, and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not be in talks with “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a full transformation that will turn all their business models completely upside down in one go.”
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the “mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web that is being built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: clergyman and bearer of the Victoria Cross from World War I honored
The only Church of England clergyman to have earned a Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier is honored 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant-Colonel, the Reverend Bernard Vann received the award following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, so he never knew he had the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “brilliantly symbolic” that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns".
He later stormed on to the firing line and led the line forward before running alone to a field gun and taking out three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never match, but also something that makes me feel humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade that was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people".
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig in place
Imagine you stayed up all night to watch a stuffed Bellator 206 and you don’t get to see the most important moment.
The San Jose billboard featured 13 fights, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready for their fight, viewers in the UK were unpleasantly surprised when the station switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were outraged because they had stayed awake all night especially for this fight.
One fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to government regulations, no content that is not suitable for children may be shown after 6:00 a.m., and that's why we had to switch to the children's program," Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yesss."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said they will be adjusting their programming to ensure viewers in the UK have a chance in the future as well.
"I think, in view of the return match, that we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, a lot of text messages went back and forth and believe me, these weren’t all equally friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government problem.
I can promise that this will not happen a second time.
We limited the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘inferior’ because of his sexual orientation
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his childhood because of his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to secondary school, he didn’t realize that “not everyone is the way I am.”
In a talk on Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that parenting had helped him put less value on winning at the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the long-running show, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverne’s first program, Daley said he felt “less” than others during his childhood because it was “socially unacceptable to like both girls and boys.”
“To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone” so he wouldn’t disappoint people if they eventually found out about his orientation.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a standout campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he considered himself lucky that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others “hope”.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, “completely surprised me.”
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to endure so much so young," he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of fourteen and his father died three years later from cancer, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me this question last year, I would have replied that it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already received the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t get it over my heart to say, you won’t be there to sit in the front row, Dad,” he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stopped and he died, I could finally acknowledge that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I'd dreamed about this all my life. Diving for a home crowd during the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, which had greatly affected him on the way to the games and which still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he must find his form again to not make it a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who is competing in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record, was placed on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving range, in an attempt to figure out what it's about.
Because he was never known for his straight drives even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the tight fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs routinely punishes wandering balls.
And if the track itself isn’t daunting enough, Mickelson will face the always-accurate British Open winner Francesco Molinari in Sunday’s ninth match, tied with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind at the start of the 12 single matches start well, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown confidence in this man, although he honestly could hardly do otherwise.
“He fully understood the role he had today, hit me on the back, put his arm around me and said he’s ready for it tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of faith in himself.
He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two matches.
I expected more of it, but it's the way it is and it's the way we think we should act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson could improve Nick Faldo’s record for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played.
It could also spell the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never quite matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, lost 20 matches and 7 matches to his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain intangible influence on the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s witty, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great guy to have on the team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players liked to fool him from time to time last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game.”
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great lead can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead prior to the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup, can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Dane made his debut in the game at Valderrama in 1997, where the team with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually crossed the finish line with the smallest possible margin: 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just,” said Bjorn, called off here, after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that this is not a game that has been played yet.
Everyone will have to be fully committed tomorrow.
Get started and execute the plan on the right one.
It's not over until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, and that’s winning this trophy, and we need to keep focusing on that.
I keep on saying, I focus on the 12 players we have at our disposal, but we are also aware of the people who are on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Delighted by the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never anticipate the business in this area.
Tomorrow a new challenge awaits.
The individual achievements will be discussed tomorrow, and that is a completely different discipline.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re on your own, your abilities as a golfer are only really tested.
That’s the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he must also get the best out of himself.”
In contrast to Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of turnaround on the last day, as a member of the winning team at Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
“I remember every damn word of that speech,” he said in response to the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999, had cheered up his players for the final day.
“We have 12 important matches ahead of us tomorrow, but let’s try to get off to a good start, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there is a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We’ve aligned our line-up with this and we’re sending the guys off in the order we think is the best and, you know, we’re going to try and pull something out of the hat tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the counteroffensive, using Rory McIlroy for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the remaining Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I chose this group in this order because I think we're so constantly covered," Bjorn said of his selection of single players.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The German Navy’s newest frigate should have entered service in 2014, replacing the outdated Cold War-era warships, but it will take at least another year before it’s ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years in a row, far away from the home ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are already obsolete by the time they are put into operation, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated frigate F125 made headlines last year, when the German navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial “software and hardware defects” that would render the warship useless if deployed in a combat mission.
Software failures were especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels are served by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen-class.
It also became clear that the ship is suffering from a serious overweight, which will reduce performance and limit the capabilities of the Navy to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class that were used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including crew training, is already a problem.
This is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion, compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that the newest frigates have in their grip become extra important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German navy is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defence commission in Germany, acknowledged that the navy actually “has a shortage of deployable ships”.
The official said the problem has grown over time like a snowball, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were yet available to be admitted to the navy.
National Trust eavesdrops on the secret lives of bats
New research conducted on an estate in the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and contribute to future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, follows the common and small dwarf bats, the brown large-eared bat and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to track the bats’ activities throughout the season.
NTS employees and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's screams and what kind does what.
A map of the habitat and a report are then produced in order to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor to the NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making grasslands and how best to maintain forests for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping accommodations and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
In reality, bats are not blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight path.
At the NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten species of bats.
Landscape manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for the bats.
“Here in Threave, we have a great environment for bats,” he said.
"We have the old buildings, a lot of very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much is not yet known about bats, and that’s why the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of monitoring bats before maintenance work is carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping place can lead to the death of 400 female bats and their young, potentially eradicating an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to contribute to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and of many of our species, we simply don't yet know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo dismisses sexual assault charges as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo qualifies allegations of sexual assault as “fake news” and said people “want to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the allegations were published.
The Portugal and Juventus strikers are accused of assaulting an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of having paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Via a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the allegations were reported, called the reports “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they’re saying today is fake news,” says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
“They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy man, and thoroughly good," the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the charges they called “an intolerable report of suspicions in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the footballer wants compensation for the “moral damage for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident allegedly took place in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga, according to the report, went back to the footballer's room, where he raped her anally, according to the accusation, as can be read in the indictment filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a “good guy” for “99 percent,” but that he is sometimes abandoned that “one percent.”
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures were taken of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “afraid of the consequences” and because she was worried about the “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old now says she wants to have the scheme declared invalid because she has been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and left this summer to Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret forever’ if carmakers leave
The UK “will regret forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a “no-deal Brexit” would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My vision is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory stall,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Car manufacturers are most concerned about risks in the supply chain in the event of a ‘no-deal Brexit’.
Toyota’s production line runs on the just-in-time principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be unrest at the borders that industry believes could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota cannot store more than one day of stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be halted in that case.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is “exactly aligned to avoid those checks at the border.”
“We need to have a deal, we want to have the best deal, which will not only allow us to continue the current success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he told listeners of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be shut down, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company’s competitive position and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a representative for the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are lost, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein Meeting May Be Delayed Again, White House Says
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed another week” as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, links between Trump’s aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump is going to fire the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence has been running the Washington gossip machine for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and to depose the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors circulated that he was about to file his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he “would rather not” dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump gave the FBI orders to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the vote in the entire Senate again.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set yet, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not caused by an aversion to the “attention-grabbing” TV journalists, though, she added: “I won’t deny that they’re trying to attract attention.”
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him,” she said, without providing any evidence, “we looked at the numbers.”
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do that a lot and you’ve seen us do that a lot over the past few weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with dignitaries who are visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated possibly why, he made a candid and at times bizarre appearance to the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland workers from other EU countries
The Minister of Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and wish that they continue to work for the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be made.
But at the same time, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know these must be uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and provide benefits for the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injury
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery yesterday after suffering a head injury in the 31-27 lost game against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's head coach, told reporters that the accident occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and more or less collapsed there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff immediately gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines, before placing him on a stretcher and taking him with them for further research.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details yet as to the type/size of the injury,” and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He has been tackled a total of five times before leaving the field on Saturday, so he has been tackled a total of 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when buying a house in the UK and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless according to new Conservative plans
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn’s success to attract young voters
The increase of the fee is levied on persons who do not pay tax in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK and the extra proceeds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn, who attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and redress this to high-earners.
The increase in the fee is levied on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional proceeds being put into an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which comes on top of the current fees, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and homes purchased for the lease, could go up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year in this way.
An estimated 13 percent of new construction in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK, driving up prices and making it difficult for starters to get a foot on the housing ladder.
Many affluent areas in the country, particularly in the capital, have practically become “ghost cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in fees to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping prices high by buying up land and not using it, and he called on May to abolish quotas on affordable homes in order to restore the “housing shame” in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a striking set of housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to evictions “without negligence.”
He also wants to give local governments more opportunities to build new houses.
May said: “Last year I said I wanted to spend my time as Prime Minister restoring the British Dream, that life is getting better for every new generation.
And that means that our faulty housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be as easy for non-UK residents and foreign companies to buy homes here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof over their heads is all too real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, Sunderland’s chief executive, says his “ultimate ambition” is to one day become Scotland’s manager.
The Scotsman, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east of England, which is currently in third place in League One, on three points from first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership the previous season.
“As a footballer, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B-team and with that the stocking was finished,” Ross told Sportssound on BBC Scotland.
“When I was a kid, I used to see Scotland play at Hampden Park with my dad and it’s something that keeps attracting me.
However, that possibility would only come when I am successful in managing a club."
Ross’s predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O’Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated into becoming the successor to these established names at a major club, having previously refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is currently measured by 'can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
“Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to achieve this, but I can’t see myself as successful until I bring the club back there.”
Ross is only three years into his career as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from being on the verge of relegation to winning the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a footballer with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably really a crossroads,” he recalled when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I was doing pretty well, I earned fairly well and I have known a few reasonable highlights.
Football can be tough.
There are a lot of things that you face every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the profession, but management just feels good.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager, and now that I’m a manager, I’m as good in my own skin as I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, research reveals
The summer heatwave has increased revenues from British pubs struggling to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues were 4.8 percent lower, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy CGA, which collected the figures, said: "Continuous sunshine and the fact that England took part in the World Championships longer than expected meant that July showed a pattern similar to June, when the pubs had 2.8 percent more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants were now hit even harder.
The drop of 1.8 percent in restaurant sales in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on beverage sales performed by far the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also focused on selling food also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatically as the restaurants.
It looks like people were just going out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, beverage sales were 6.6 percent higher for the month, while food sales were 3 percent lower.”
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hospitality industry analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for revenue in the entertainment market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year turnover drop is particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the operators who focus on food, and only time will tell whether the more temperate temperatures of August can give the necessary respite.
Total revenue growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline from the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry revenue monitor, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. This is the industry’s established benchmark.

Survey of 20,000 High School Students Revealed Growth in 'False Insta Pages'
This news has exacerbated the fear that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a ‘main account’ that they also show to their parents
One in five children, some under the age of 11, create social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in the “false Insta accounts,” a reference to Instagram, the photo-sharing site.
This news has exacerbated the fear that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean “main account” that they show to their parents, while also having personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally ended up at the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager there who asked others to “rape” her.
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half admitted to holding personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teens are being lured into creating online spaces where they aren’t found by their parents and teachers.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and in the field and chairman Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the sport's directors to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are confident that Scotland’s athletics will benefit enormously from her election to the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help run the sport in Scotland.”
The American who won the 200 metres and the 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could not walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: “Today, a month ago, I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It has been terribly hard work, but I have now fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thanks for all the support!”
Breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows divides online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has distributed the online opinion with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to cows that are milked.
To mark the introduction of what has been dubbed “the quietest portable breast pump in the world,” Elvie, consumer technology producer, has released an ironic, music-video-inspired ad to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to pumping mothers.
Four real moms dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see any of it” and “In case you didn’t notice, these aren’t udders, these are my breasts.”
The chorus continues with: 'Pumps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's'.
However, the ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, immediately caused an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has provoked hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say it condones the “horror” of the dairy industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but in their case, the babies are taken away within a few days after delivery."
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else commented, “This is obviously traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don’t we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added, “This ad is so far from reality.”
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was "hilarious."
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
That pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit weird, but I didn't look too much behind it.
This is a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: “This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who are pumping (often in the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like they’re just ‘cows’.
This advertisement is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and discreetly fits into a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they're pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, says: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a tough and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between pumping mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to put the pumping and the associated challenges in the spotlight and at the same time show in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible feeling of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made the front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski’s catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of incarcerated migrant children has peaked, though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration make it harder to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and are afraid of jeopardizing their own chance to stay in the country by signing up for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and the remaining adult members of their household would have to hand in their fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before Congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
We're prosecuting these people," Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules, requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of starting detention, rather than within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to shelter staff.
Many of them will be in court, rather than in person, through a video conference, to plead their application for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter staff and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is struggling are more often ignored, due to the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare for it or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, France and Turkey 'occupying force' to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even as the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that the foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "this will be handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted and driven from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "this sacred struggle until we liberate all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from a "possible illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions are favorable for their return and he blamed “some Western countries for spreading irrational fears” that keep most refugees away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return,” he said.
“They are politicizing a case that should only be a humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid for Syria will not be available until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created the opportunity to launch political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that this agreement has “clear deadlines” and said he hoped the military action will target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who “will be exterminated.”
Staffan de Mistura, the UN representative, hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the terms of the Syrian government’s participation in the commission, saying the panel’s work should be limited “to revising the articles of the current constitution” and he warned against outside interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many “liberal” viewers are likely to hope, his presidency is prematurely terminated by impeachment proceedings and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever.”
At the moment, however, there are no signs of viewing fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during “prime-time,” compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” is at the top of ratings for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
“This is a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the person in charge of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines coming out of Washington may influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or affect the status of the global economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond wanting to be a well-informed citizen, when you get to see that you’ve been sitting for six hours looking at a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the “deep background” by Bob Woodward in his book “Fear,” which talks about the jacket of peacock leather by Paul Manafort that has cost the $15,000 anaplication of the “Stormcus imms” by The Washington Post.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“What he’s doing to give you the idea that it’s a reality show is, in part, that he’s putting something new on you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the rotating cast of the Trump show and the daily plot changes.
You can’t afford to miss an episode or you feel like you’re behind.

He couldn't pull himself off the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember doing all those weird shows, not so long ago, and people saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money flowing from outside in the most exciting midterm elections to the House of Representatives
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th district sees an influx of money, thanks to a reshuffle of a constituency that forces two sitting MPs to fight for the same seat.
The recently reclassified district of Pittsburg will meet Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces off against another sitting MP, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The maps were reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a battle of campaign finance between the financial poor of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a well-respected special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
This seat was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points difference.
According to political experts, Democrats have a small advantage.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for support to China and has refrained from doing so.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners shut down the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the “recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan,” the ministry’s spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only considered in the case of El Salvador, as the country received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference that would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from leaving for the United States.
But in mid-September, some top government officials announced that they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible punitive measures against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan now is for Vice President Mike Pence to deliver a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the government attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further fuss, with no harsh messages about Washington’s punitive measures.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who have agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step may be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible countermeasures to the justice system, for which weighty evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller is also likely to focus his investigation on collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If Congress changes color, Trump will have to answer for himself for that institution, just as he is getting ready to turn back to the voters, and maybe he will have to answer for a jury in a court of law.
That’s a lot of ifs, and I don’t want to suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
Choices will have to be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, who will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
As a result, we failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such bend points and the inexorable advance of democracy is thereby accelerated or slowed down.
Americans are currently facing several of these kinds of bend points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the moment this magazine reported that he, last year, had suggested taking up talks with the president in secret and that he had speculated about the president’s suitability for his office.
Rosenstein says The Times' report is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s new requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and an unfair testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, democracy awaits a very long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me away to light candles for the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika is depicted.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Wien
Rangers get Rapid Wien on visit on Thursday and know that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans was not able to play his first game of the season until the 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that score as a springboard to better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really have a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game with the idea that there was something to win and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have even won in the end, but over the whole match, a tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it’s going to be a tough game because they also had a good result in their last game, but if the crowd gets behind us, I’m sure we can push through and we can get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been tough, of everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feelgood factor on the club.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can push through now, leave the last season behind us and be successful again.”
Women can’t sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they want to receive care, few people discuss this with their family members.
About half of the participants in Nationwide’s survey said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps necessary to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
That's where we'll start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not make your wishes known well in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you’re going to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Get a financial advisor: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay for these expenses.
Your funding choices for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or using equity as insurance as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes when the insurance needs to be used.
Provide a health care proxy so that you can designate a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals adhere to your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that the invoices are paid if you can no longer do this yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine your elderly father or mother encountering a medical emergency and heading for the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Capture these details in a written plan so you have the information at hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes out.”
Man shot several times with air pressure rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. BST, as a "random act."
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Because the means of communication have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly hit by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to the Agency for Combating Disasters of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake occurred south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed around 300 lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by crashing buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, for the most part on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin and vice-presidential candidate, has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, had been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and offering opposition during the arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged offenses, he took the phone from her.
Palin is being held in custody at the home of custody Mat-Su with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, sure" when asked to do so, the network reported.
Palin is indicted for three Class A infractions, meaning he could be sentenced to one year in prison and fined up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B infraction, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of abusing his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic abuse, interference with a report of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon under influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin has been criticized by a veterans’ group in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD, which he would have left to serve in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake has caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down while the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for New York City terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect in the terror attack in New York City, which killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, according to the indictment, used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists who came in his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the letter of intent demanding the death penalty, which has been filed in New York’s Southern District.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the indictment with 22 charges, including eight counts of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and preparation,” according to the prosecutors, and they described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as “horrible, cruel and depraved.”
Sajfoello Habiboellaevich Sajpov has inflicted injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been more than a decade since a case in the Southern District of New York called for the death penalty.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted two years earlier for espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He let the detectives know that he felt good about his act, they the police.
Sajpov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, police told.
He pleaded not guilty to the charges with 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he is “of course disappointed” with the prosecutors’ decision.
"We think the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Sajpov’s defense had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize a people's army" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of Ukip said politicians should “feel the heat” of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested giving him the lead in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told marchers in Birmingham that the UK “would already be out” if Mr Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge May faces in reconciling the strongly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest rally against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on track as it is attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Supporters insisted that she will continue and will try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he “want to throw Chequers in the trash.”
He suggested that Farage should be knighted and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was out of service, we'd be out by now," Bone said.
The MP for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers in the trash basket."
Clarifying his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.”
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, telling reporters: “I’m just saying Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition does not vote, it is unpopular with our party and with our activists who go door-to-door and ensure that we are elected.
Drop Chequers and listen."
In a targeted message for May, she added: “Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the meeting that politicians should “feel the heat” if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we’re not letting you get away with this.’
In a message to the enthusiastic masses, he added: “I want you to fire our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, against the clock.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has given us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have once again become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom.”
In the meantime Remainers marched through Birmingham and concluded this march with a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the formation of this group on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the upper house for Labour, joked about the security issues of a Conservative party app at the start of their conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘think hard’ about running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “think carefully” about her candidacy for the presidency after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told of her future during a meeting at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican delegate who co-chaired Trum’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she might be fighting Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
An attendee asked her if she would run for president.
Warren replied that it is “time for women to go to Washington to repair our faulty government and that includes a woman at the top.”
LSU's Wayde Sims Arrested for Shooting
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested following the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, during an ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help identifying the man featured in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound to the head and died from the consequences," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and has confessed to being at the crime scene, to being in possession of a firearm and to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and is being held in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 1.98-meter junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started in 10 games last season. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel has let him win after orders from team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and almost left Hamilton in the cold when he defended his position and Vettel invited his teammate to attack.
Vettel went into the pits and let Hamilton ride in the crowd in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on top after a wheel-on-wheel action which forced the Ferrari driver reluctantly to leave space on the inside after a double movement in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a time, as he stayed with his choice of tyres and aimed for a fast finish, allowing him to overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Eventually, he went to the pits in the 44th round, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen was fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, he was a real gentleman and let me by.
The team has done its best for places one and two,” Hamilton said.
That wasn't good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during an election rally on Saturday over the fact that she insisted she was not the source of Christine Blasey Ford’s leaked letter, in which the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election rally in West Virginia, the president was not directly referring to the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that what happened in the Senate showed that people can be "mean, unkind and untrue."
“The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that is taking place in the Senate in the last few days, when you see the anger, when you are the people that are angry and mean and mean and unkind and untrue,” he said.
“When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her answer... did you leak the document - 'oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't leak," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter mentioning the allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein has denied that her agency was the leak.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she had asked.”
But the president turned out to not believe her denial, and he commented on it at the meeting on Saturday night: “I’ll tell you what, that wasn’t good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who is accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power, by all necessary means.
You see the meanness, the unkindness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive to seize power and regain control,” the president said, according to a report from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have made up for Friday’s loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead by scoring two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team aside before Dwyer put the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard made the tie for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's men, who had to make up a deficit on Friday night to then defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 1:10 p.m., before Matt Marquardt led Cownie's equaliser at 3:16 p.m.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team re-captured and Bouchard brought them back on an equal footing with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He secured the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies While Allowing Hundreds to Escape Earthquake on Plane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he ensured that an aircraft with hundreds of people on board could take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that subsequently caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried below the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly moving control tower of the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air's 6321, which was ready at the time on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He later died at the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported from Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, before the helicopter reached Palu.
“It breaks your heart when you hear it,” he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the death toll may rise to thousands, and the country’s disaster response agency said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll is still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the soldiers present: "I appeal to all of you to work day and night so that all the tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one more man is missing, after previously reporting that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger went missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew members after the plane had come into water during the landing at the airport of the Chuuk Islands.
Authorities announced Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone’s condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what the exact order of events is remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane has landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane was shot down over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and some others managed to wade through the water, which came to their means, to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he had a non-serious head wound.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors working nearby at a shipyard also helped with the rescue work by bringing people to shore with an inflatable boat, before the plane sank further into the approximately 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have been killed in crashes of airlines registered with the PNG in the past twenty years, but none of these relate to Air Niugini.
Analyst records the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisitory on Friday in the reopened trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, a U.S. Department of Justice analyst, gave a few hours of testimony as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used cell phone call records to record the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she was killed.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police again went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was on the stand on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was at Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted his phone's text messages, calls, and contact information.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense begins Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to begin deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hip hop'?
A hip hop trio wants to question the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol state that hip hop is alienated from its origins with political opinions and addressing social issues.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hip hop' popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently had a revival in Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York City nanny takes a couple to court over 'racist' text
A nanny from New York is suing a couple for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after she received a mistranslated text in which the mother complained about “again being black.”
The couple denied being racist and called the lawsuit “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, showed her dismay when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a black woman when she met her on her first day at work in 2016.
“No, no, no,” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice no less than twice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt “uncomfortable,” fired Ms. Maurice when she realized her blunder, stating that her former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job, and that she had therefore expected a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a working day and then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice is taking the couple to court to get compensation of $350 a day for the 6 months she was hired to bicker internally with the family, albeit without a contract.
“I want them to feel like you just don’t do something like that,” Maurice told the New York Post last Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple bit off regarding the claim that she was racist by saying it was reasonable to fire Maurice after they were afraid, by insulting her, that they could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn’t want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We’re not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who had offended you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, come on.
Comparing the lawsuit to “extortion,” Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was “in a very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to prosecute someone like that?
That’s not so pleasant,” the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit is still in progress, public opinion is quick to capitalize on the couple on social media, where they are denounced for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers feared the public would not have much interest in a talking bear, newly revealed letter reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into the shoes of someone who’s reading it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington’s huge success, it’s very entertaining.”
She said her father, who, before being inspired to write the children’s book about a little toy bear, worked as a cameraman at the BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication felt “bittersweet” after his death last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very prominent member of the family,” she told me, her father was secretly proud of the eventual success.
She said, "He was a quiet, humble man."
“But because Paddington was so lifelike to him, it almost looked like a child’s achievement; you’re proud when you haven’t done anything for it yourself.
I think he pretty much experienced Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear himself for the success.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
Immediately after landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad had called several times to say it looked very bad and was expected not to make it,” Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then came the call from Nad to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The drugs the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly worn out and left her body.
She had died some time before that, and this process shut everything down further.
I could only sit there knowing what was going on.
I couldn’t whine, scream or cry, because I was in the middle of all kinds of people and families.
I had to be really big.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
“I sat with my head down and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I got an overwhelming sense of compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving Women Post Messages on Bridge to Prevent Suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are fighting to keep others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys post inspiring messages and phone numbers that people in need can call for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel like how I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney in the English county of Gloucestershire, tells that her son was a promising chef with a contagious grin.
“He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile lit up every room.”
Yet he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the pit.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis has made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don’t be silent, talk about it.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he was feeling sad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was all on the ground on Christmas Day - when the kids were unpacking their presents, he didn't look at them or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they have to deal with it: "It's tearing the whole family apart.
It drives us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain as FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could actually get what he’s asking for, an investigation limited in time and scope, we might be able to create some more unity,” Mr. Flake said last Saturday, adding that he was worried that the committee was ‘falling apart’ amid a firmly entrenched stalemate within the party.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has everything to do with timing.
The midterm elections are already in five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, their attempts to get their husband elected to the highest court in the country are seriously complicated.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus met his wife Ashley, who the Bush was his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI finishes the report?
Then there will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would give Vice President Mike Pence the opportunity to cast the deciding vote to confirm Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea ‘down’ under Kim
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, states that there were 1,127 defectors last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park noted that tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human traffickers, were the main factors driving the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded publicly.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily secured demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the defectors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often expels them by force.
Relations between North and South, which are still formally at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stagnating negotiations on denuclearization.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, where they broadly agreed to work towards the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of the lack of progress in lifting U.S. sanctions since then.
“Without faith in the actions of the United States, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under those circumstances there is no question of a first step of unilateral disarmament,” Mr. Ri said during a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman behaved this way, she would be called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes almost screamed and was especially upset when he told about his family and his high school days.
He also emphatically condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him “grotesque and coordinated character assassination,” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she felt Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats,” Pelosi said.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth in Congress, or to the FBI, then he’s not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but for the court where he now serves,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District of Columbia District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would speak out against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh bypassed questions about reviewing certain Supreme Court decisions during confirmation hearings.
“Don’t expect us to stand up and cheer if a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed to the Supreme Court,” Pelosi said.
Women just have to admit it.
It’s a righteous tirade of months and years of pent-up anger overflowing, and she can only cry to get it out.
“We’re going to cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s weird, do you?”
She continued: 'I was greatly helped by a woman who was a manager somewhere and who told me that she too would cry when she got angry. She developed a method in which she would cry whenever she got angry. To the person she was talking to, she said: 'You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry.'
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought that was brilliant.”
Tears are partially permitted as an expression of anger, because crying is essentially misunderstood.
One of my best memories from a former job, in a male-dominated office, is when I had to cry terribly because I was so angry. An older woman, a chilly business executive that everyone was a little afraid of, grabbed my neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she said to me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad they got you on the shelf.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was embroiled in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally meaning 'cat trouble' or 'monkey areas') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder felt there was no reason why she would not run for office.
“It wasn’t an informed decision,” she told me, laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was lagging behind with fundraising, so she vowed not to participate if she couldn’t raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
"Do they think I might get a discount?" she wondered.
When she delivered her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign anyway, she was so overwhelmed by feelings – of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and to reach voters instead of deputies, and of anger at sexism – that she was choking on it.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled of how the media reacted to her.
“They will have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my tombstone?
"She was crying"?'
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The opening salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, experts say a long-term gap between the two countries could prove beneficial to Beijing.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by raising taxes on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation became known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (€150 billion) in goods; half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has taken in-kind reprisals every time, most recently by raising tariffs from 5 to 10% for $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to match the U.S. every time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to blink.
For Washington to bow, requests must be granted, but public bowing to the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays smart, the trade war with the US could support China positively in the longer term, as the interdependence between the two economies decreases.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could put either country in an economic free fall is actually much more dangerous than viewers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank specializing in national security issues that focuses on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a more than seven-year war.
During his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in his country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorists, and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
An estimated six million people are still in need of humanitarian assistance in the country.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that had subsidized the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the golf course "Le Golf National" southwest of Paris in France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn achieved the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was struggling almost the entire tournament, let his long stroke from the tee end up in the water at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shone in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever made it 5-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the lowest scoring of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes to play.
The highest ranked player on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who possibly played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Segrio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so soon, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It’s about the team, and I’m glad I could help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole to go in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The tremendous pride I feel for beating Tiger Woods, and I've been following that guy since I was a kid growing up," Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic from one of the greatest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find the fairways over the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level throughout the tournament.
The U.S. captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
A short time this morning we have made Europe a little more difficult.
We resisted.
All respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to take your hat off to the opponent.
We've been overplayed."
